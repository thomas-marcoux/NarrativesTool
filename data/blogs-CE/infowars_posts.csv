1,infowars,Canada’s “Wokest” PM Just Took A Hit In The Polls After Blackface Scandal,2019-09-22 00:00:00,Zero Hedge,,"It wasn’t a good week for Canada’s “wokest” leader, Justin Trudeau, after multiple images of the Liberal Party Prime Minister in ‘brownface’ and ‘blackface’ emerged. If the images from a 2001 “Arabian Nights” party released Wednesday weren’t bad enough, a follow-up video showing a separate third blackface incident released soon after his public apology made things even worse, taking the cringe level higher.

Two major polls published Saturday show that during the days encompassing the scandal emerging, Canada’s Liberal Party took a hit, however a modest one, in what could be a sign of more significant slipping to come.



Reuters reports of the two polls’ results, less than five weeks ahead of the country’s Oct. 21 federal election:

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer had a 4.8 percentage-point lead against Trudeau, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Saturday for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper. Scheer had a 3.2 percentage-point lead in the previous survey published on Friday.




Conservatives would win 36.8% of the vote and the Liberals 32%, the poll said…

The Nanos poll was conducted over three nights until Sept. 20. The first image of Trudeau in blackface at a 2001 “Arabian Nights” party when he was a 29-year-old teacher emerged on the evening of Sept. 18.

And of the second poll, Reuters summarizes: 


The Liberals were leading in a Mainstreet poll published by iPolitics on Saturday, but hadlost 0.4 percentage point from the previous survey compared with a 0.2 percentage-point slide by the Conservatives.

The Mainstreet poll, conducted between Sept. 17 and 19, had the Liberals at 36.8% compared with 34.2% for the Conservatives.

Scheer, Trudeau’s Conservative rival vying to replace him as PM, has been in a statistical tie with the incumbent in most polls taken for the past few months, but got the noticeable bump just as the images surfaced.





Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli join The Alex Jones Show to break down why Kamala Harris can’t get support after her crimes against black communities in America.

Meanwhile the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Green Party are pouncing, and can now more easily hit Trudeau from the left, pealing off additional valuable liberal votes.



Dear @JustinTrudeau, now there’s a video.

How can we trust you to fight for racial equity in housing & employment, racial justice in schools & our immigration system?

Our realities aren’t a joke or a game.

Thinking of everyone impacted.#elxn43https://t.co/f7hRcQjho9…

“Almost none of the soft Liberal support is interested in tipping to the Conservatives. Any Liberal scandal doesn’t significantly increase Conservative support, but would go to the NDP or Greens,” said Marc Di Gaspero, of consumer research firm Potloc.

Analysts cited by Reuters suggest Trudeau’s lingering blackface scandal might not necessarily cause a mass exodus of Liberals in terms of support, but would most likely see many more simply stay home compared to if the damning images had never emerged.

2,infowars,"Corruption Scandal Could Cost Trudeau His Job, Polls Show",2019-02-21 00:00:00,Zero Hedge,,"Since it was exposed by a report in Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month, the scandal that’s become known as the SNC-Lavalin affair has already led to the firing of one of Trudeau’s closest advisors and raised serious questions about whether the prime minister was complicit in pressuring the attorney general to offer a deferred prosecution agreement with a large, Quebec-based engineering firm.

And according to the first round of polls released since the affair exploded into public view…



…it could cost Trudeau his position as prime minister and return control to the conservatives, according to the CBC.

Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead with 37% to 32% for the Liberals, while both Ipsos and Léger put the margin at 36% to 34% in the Conservatives’ favour. Since December, when both polling firms were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research’s polling and four percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November in the Léger poll.




The polls also showed that a large proportion of the public believes the prime minister for abruptly firing former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould over what many suspect was her decision not to bend to his will. Some 67% of Canadians are paying attention to the story, the polls show. But not everybody has made up their minds about Trudeau’s involvement.

Of those with some knowledge of the controversy, 41% agreed with this statement: “Yes, the prime minister did something wrong.” “Only 12% said that the prime minister “did not do anything wrong.”

Another 41 per cent said that they were “not sure either way,” suggesting that many Canadians are still waiting to learn more before coming down on one side or the other.

Trudeau claims that when he discussed the case with Wilson-Raybould, he told her to handle it as she saw fit. Shortly after, she was ousted in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle, and soon resigned. She has reportedly hired an attorney to advise her on what she can and cannot say about the scandal.

And while the October general election is still a long way off, there’s plenty of time between now and then for the other shoe to drop.

Rebel Media owner Ezra Levant has offered $10,000 for video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau singing ‘Day-O’ in a fake Jamaican accent during his college days.

During his apology last night for appearing in a 2001 photo dressed as a dark-skinned Arab man, Trudeau was forced to acknowledge that it wasn’t the only time he’d blacked up.

He had also donned an afro and make-up to sing Harry Belafonte’s “Banana Boat Song (Day-O)” – a ditty about people in Jamaica loading bananas onto boats – during a talent show.

A photo of Trudeau performing the song has already emerged, but the footage – if it exists – is in even greater demand.



BOUNTY: I will pay $10,000 for video of Trudeau in blackface singing Day-O.

“BOUNTY: I will pay $10,000 for video of Trudeau in blackface singing Day-O,” tweeted Rebel Media founder Ezra Levant.

“Don’t give it to the CBC — they’ll delete it,” he warned.

Looks like this isn’t going to blow over any time soon.

5,infowars,Justin Trudeau Wants to Censor the Internet if He Wins Re-Election,2019-10-21 00:00:00,Paul Joseph Watson | Infowars.com,,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will mandate social media companies to censor “online hate and disinformation” if he wins re-election.

That’s right, the world’s number 1 blackface enthusiast will decide what constitutes “harmful” content.

Trudeau’s Liberal Party responded to the following question; “Does your party support the development of a national strategy to combat online hate and disinformation?”




“To help stop the proliferation of violent extremism online, we will move forward with new regulations for social media platforms starting with a requirement that all platforms remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours or face significant financial penalties,” was the party’s response.

The move comes after Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which banned posts on the Internet considered to spread “hatred or contempt,” was repealed by Parliament.

Trudeau party reps have previously met with top Facebook execs in an effort to ramp up censorship efforts.

According to progressives, “hate speech” is anything that contradicts their dogma. Giving Trudeau the power to censor such content is a trap door to the widespread evisceration of free speech online.

“Ultimately, free speech is hate speech, and hate speech is free speech,” warns Mark Steyn. “It’s for the speech you hate, the speech you revile. The alternative to free speech is approved speech, and that necessarily means approved by whom?”

The Canadian election is too close to call. Trudeau could lose to the Conservatives or be forced to head up a minority government by forming a shaky coalition.

7,infowars,Political Scientist: Trudeau ‘Blackface’ Scandal Could Cost Him the Election,2019-09-19 00:00:00,Paul Joseph Watson | Infowars.com,,"A political scientist predicts that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ‘blackface’ scandal could cost him the upcoming election.

Canadians go to the polls on October 21, 2019, to elect members of the House of Commons to the 43rd Canadian Parliament. Polls show a tight race between Trudeau’s Liberal party and the opposition Conservatives.

Over the past 24 hours, two separate photos and a video have emerged of Trudeau dressing up in ‘blackface’ on three separate occasions.

In the video, Trudeau’s entire arms and legs are ‘blacked up’ as he performs exaggerated gestures in an apparent attempt to mimic or mock black people.

Another image is taken from when Trudeau performed the Banana Boat Song (Day-O) as part of a talent show in a Jamaican accent while blacked up and wearing an afro wig.





University of B.C. political scientist Max Cameron says the controversy could cost Trudeau crucial votes in key swing areas due to “diverse” voters being put off by his past behavior.

“There are many ridings where the margin of victory is very narrow,” Cameron told the Vancouver Sun. “In the context where every vote matters this could have a real impact.”

“Is this something you can come back from?” asked Cameron. “He embodies white privilege and he should have known better.”

The political scientist said the blackface issue completely undermines Trudeau’s virtue signalling about diversity and multiculturalism.

“This is a real dent in the strongest part of his armor,” he said.

Trudeau’s approval rating was already sinking thanks to a corruption scandal. He could now be finished.

The world’s tiniest violin plays.

8,infowars,Second ‘Blackface’ Photo of Justin Trudeau Emerges,2019-09-19 00:00:00,Paul Joseph Watson | Infowars.com,,"A second ‘blackface’ photograph of Justin Trudeau has emerged showing the Canadian Prime Minister dressed as a black man during his performance of ‘Day-O’.

Trudeau was embroiled in controversy last night after a photo emerged of him dressed as an Arab for an ‘Arabian Nights’ theme party in 2001.

The Prime Minister was teaching at an elite private school when the photo was taken.



Trudeau was forced to admit that this was not the only time he had blacked up, referring to another incident during which he dressed up as a black man and sang the Banana Boat Song (Day-O) in a faux Jamaican accent.

That picture from Trudeau’s college days has now been leaked too.

“Sources have confirmed to me that this is THE picture of @JustinTrudeau in blackface from high school that he referenced in his press conference. From the year book at Brebeuf college,” tweeted journalist Evan Solomon.

Trudeau appears to have darkened his skin and is wearing a fake afro wig.

— Evan Solomon (@EvanLSolomon) September 19, 2019



Trudeau’s apology included his assertion that, “I didn’t consider it racist at the time, but now we know better.”

This illustrates how the PM has become another victim of the ‘progressive’ retroactive purity test, the rules to which are updated daily with no one being able to keep up with them.

Identity politics eats its own again. Glorious.

You helped make the bed, Justin. Time to lie in it.

10,infowars,Trudeau Vows to Slash Taxes as Blackface Scandal Rocks Polls,2019-09-23 00:00:00,Infowars.com,,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is vowing to reduce income taxes and cellphone costs in an apparent move to salvage support for his re-election bid amid a blackface scandal that has heavily damaged his poll numbers, Reuters reports.


“Canadians work hard, and they deserve to sleep easy at night,” Trudeau announced on Sunday. “By lowering taxes and cutting cellphone bills, our Liberal team will put more than $1,500 per year back in the pockets of hardworking Canadian families.”

Trudeau’s Liberal Party had held a seemingly comfortable advantage over the Conservatives ahead of October’s federal elections, but following the release of multiple bombshell photos and video depicting Trudeau in ‘blackface,’ that lead “evaporated almost overnight,” according to pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research.

“The Liberals were at or very close to a majority” in the House of Commons, Graves asserted. “That’s completely turned around and maybe the Conservatives are in majority range now.”





A political scientist predicts that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ‘blackface’ scandal could cost him the upcoming election.

11,infowars,Trudeau’s ‘Victory Speech’ Turns Into Scandal as He Interrupts Rival’s Address,2019-10-22 00:00:00,RT,,"The series of campaigning cycle scandals in Canada spilled over into election night when Justin Trudeau took to the stage to deliver his victory speech while his main rival Andrew Scheer was still addressing his supporters.

The Liberals managed to retain in power in a narrow election win getting 157 seats of 338, according to Elections Canada.

Even though the result put Trudeau’s party far short of the 170 seats needed for a majority government, he was apparently too impatient to make his triumphant appearance.




While Conservative candidate Andrew Scheer was giving a speech thanking his supporters, Trudeau walked on stage, breaking into Scheer’s speech, forcing news networks to switch all attention to him.

Some anchors said they and their studio guests were “shocked” and “mystified” with Trudeau’s move. Global News’ anchor called this “unprecedented” and explained the choice of switching to his speech solely by the fact he got more votes in the election.

CTV’s news anchor said: “It’s very unorthodox for one leader to start talking while another leader is still talking.” The channel later had to screen Andrew Scheer’s speech from where they had to cut it off in order to cross to Trudeau.

Trudeau became Canada’s prime minister in 2015 with a champion’s badge for political correctness and liberal values. Soon after taking the reins in Ottawa, he enjoyed an impressive approval rating of 63% and was labeled a “geopolitical golden boy” by the media.

However, as Trudeau’s term was getting past its equator, his popularity started to plunge which resulted in nearly two-thirds of Canadians disapproving his performance by 2019 election.

Prime Minister Trudeau, who positioned himself as an arbiter of liberal values, saw his popularity slip over a video of him wearing blackface in 1990s and his handling of a corporate corruption case, apart from failing to deliver some of his core campaign promises.

Trudeau’s opponents pointed he had been unsuccessful in delivering probably the main electoral promise of his – fighting climate change – after it emerged Canada dumped tons of plastic in the Philippines and that the Prime Minister himself was the only candidate to use two planes during electoral campaign.

Trudeau’s Liberal Party is now facing a new reality of not having a majority in the parliament which means they will have to depend on one of the smaller left-leaning parties to push through key legislation.

The New Democratic Party is expected to come to the rescue, but the nature of their future relationship in the Canadian parliament seems unclear with skeptics saying NDP would be drawing Trudeau in an even more “progressive” direction. How this will be taken by Trudeau’s electorate and his critics remains a question.

12,infowars,"Yet More, High-Quality Video Of Trudeau In Blackface Has Emerged",2019-09-29 00:00:00,Zero Hedge,,"“It is a racist shame by any measure, a self-imposed humiliation that will cling to Justin Trudeau for life, regardless of how Canada’s next election ends up,” the Toronto Star wrote upon publishing the full backstory behind Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s blackface scandal.

The publication has gotten hold of a previously unreleased high-quality video of Trudeau’s third blackface incident, after a grainy and very brief version had been first released by Global News.

“It was a costume day for river guides on the whitewater rafting operation that I worked at in the summer between ‘92 and ’94, roughly,” Trudeau had admitted apologetically over a week ago after the brief, grainy clip had initially surfaced.




From the full context and close-up of the new higher quality video, it’s evident that Trudeau, who would have been between 21 and 23 years old at the time, was the only one on the trip wearing the offensive ‘blackface’ make-up, along with an afro wig and what appears to be a shirt with toucans on it (when the grainier first version surfaced, there was some debate over whether bananas were printed on the shirt).



Wow he really committed to the getup. He even wore a wig.

Also, I kind of expected more people to be dressed up for the minstrel show. But nope, just him. pic.twitter.com/JBPivnELol

A young Trudeau is seen just after the 40-second mark in the rafting trip video montage in full blackface, with the make-up covering his legs as well, making gestures toward the camera and sticking out his tongue.

Over the weekend the Toronto Star put up the high-quality video, but then without explanation set it to ‘private’ – removing it from public view, only leaving the still frame picture.

Of course, it quickly appeared on social media thereafter. Following pressure from other outlets, the video was set to public again. “After seven hours, the Star has finally made the video available to the public,” Canada’s The Post Millennial reported.

As The Sun explains further, it’s the first video to show the full context of one of the three incidents which surfaced earlier this month, but the fuller version certainly makes it worse, considering he’s “the only one who dons blackface and afro” among the many people filmed on the trip: 

A previous blurry image from this moment was widely circulated, but now a high-quality video showing Mr Trudeau has come out.

In the full clip, pals are white water rafting and kayaking during the day before a fancy dress party.

Mr Trudeau is the only one who dons a blackface and afro as he cheekily sticks his tongue out for the camera.

The clip shows he even went as far as to paint his knees and his tongue black.

But this was not a one-off for the holier-than-thou politician, who is known for calling others out for racism.

As multiple publications have highlighted, now only weeks out from Canada’s federal elections, Trudeau quickly pivoted away from the controversy after issuing a brief apology, first proposing a ban on military-style assault rifles, and this past week joining climate change protests.

His lame attempt at dramatic political distraction controversial arms restriction proposal also seeks to give cities the power to ban handguns. This is as there’s clear evidence suggesting he and his Liberal Party are slipping in the polls in the wake of the blackface scandal.

There’s also the distinct possibility that even more images and video could emerge, considering he himself previously admitted there could be more out there, and that “he didn’t totally remember”.







Identity politics eats its own again. Glorious.
