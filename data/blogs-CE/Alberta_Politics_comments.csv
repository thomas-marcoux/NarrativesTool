confuse the federal and provincial New Democratic parties yes they are federated but theres one big difference because the federal party has little chance of becoming government it naturally takes on the more idealistic position the conscience of Canadian politcs as which it has always punched much higher than its weight If LEAP is to ever have any influence it is in the Commons not provincial legislatures which being viable contenders for power eschew LEAP explicitly in no uncertain terms You corrected your notion that the NDP is rooted in Prairie socialism that married Great Depression humanitarianism with agrarian cooperatives in church nota bene the federated NDP is as you note is a cooperative amalgam of ethical Christian socialial activism with the trade union movement which is concentrated in the manufactories of the East and resource mills across nonagrarian regions of the nation When led from the economic centre Lewis Broadbent and Layton won the NDP to its greatest successes in contrast the party languished to the point of schism when led from the peripheries it might be mere happenstance that those doldrums coincided with affirmative action leadership a laudable policy and one which could be said to have inspired more women to run for every partythe conscience of Canadian federal politics striking again Farmers in the agrarian regions in contrast only get as close to unionism as grain marketing boards and wheat pools Yet its instructive to note the distinction between federal and provincial NDP in this respect there has hardly been a time during the past eight decades when one of the Prairie provinces wasnt governed by a typically provincial NDP party We might emphasize that in spite of the federal NDPs electoral disappointment in the most recent contest two Western provinces subsequently elected NDP governmentsone for the first time Neither does the right have a lock on Saskatchewan and Manitoba both having had important NDP regimesindeed even iconicin the notsodistant past Let us admit that again the two levels of our split loyalty are remarkably distinct brandname and federality notwithstanding When the federal NDP convention which includes provincial parties entertained the LEAP manifesto it wasnt but a few hours before BC Premier Horgan denounced it categorically We hardly need guess what Albertas NDP government thinks of LEAP Its important to note that the official NDP government opposition to TMX protecting BCs inside waters from dilbit spills is being pressed at the very same time Horgan and JT ostensible TMX enemies gleefully shake hands on the largest fossilfuel resource investment deal in Canadian history the massive LNG export facility in Kitimat proposed terminus for the failed Northern Gateway dilbit pipeline This seeming contradiction not only refutes your characterization of NIMBYBANANAism but it is the central political circumstance bedeviling every polity these day and especially the NDP Global ecological degradation and wealth disparity and in many nations probablyresultant racism manifest in Canada mainly by the experiences of Aboriginal nations are challenging every polity Three decadeold neoliberal usurpation of moribund traditional conservatism has been revealed responsible for much of this global dilemma and now resorts to extremism in its own discreditation encapsulated as climatechange denial and racism Canadian Liberal parties partly stung by this Geckoid neoliberalism and influenced by refugees from increasingly extreme conservative parties they have accommodated have moved markedly to the right Electoral frustration in addition to increasing environmental anxieties and dwindling prosperity are being increasingly availed by the Greens whose legitimacy increases regardless the reason voters vote for them whether for bona fide environmental concerns or incidental noneoftheabove protest votes Thus where there appears to be room for the NDP to shoehorn itself into this spectrum it also finds the paradigm shift as trying and divisive as any other party As Mulcair found out the party membership rather interprets any drift to the right even on the general politcal icefloe moving every party as cutting its nose off to spite its highly ideological face At the same time defending its traditional worker base a significant part of which works in resource development seems to have resulted in significant traditional support eroding to the Greens BCs NDP is a case in point to stem some of this trend it was forced to promise an electoral reform referendum to blunt the BC Greens main campaign platformeven though proportional representation would have provided itself little advantage as it was the Greens tripled their seats to three and secured the balance of power in the resulting NDP minority government despite serious policy differences with respect resource development the Greens may be said to be the NIMBY cats not the NDP And prorep was convincingly rejected at Referendum Long mischaracterized as the teleological extreme left by its rivals the NDP is most assuredly if uncomfortably bookended by its ideological rivals Todays question is almost entirely tactical for the NDP depending on the byelection outcome the NDP may be forced to consider its longterm strategy but it will continue to be buffeted by global circumstances like all the other parties Remind that Avi Lewis LEAP is highly contentious within the partybut only at the federal conscienceofparliament level its been mooted as an issue provincially as well the old scarred warhorse Svend Robinson cut at least some of his teeth on the NPI New Politics Initiative he and a small party cabal fomented during a raucous national convention under Alexa Mcdonoughs Leadership the most serious potential schism since the Waffel These divisive personalities might work dangerously upon the circumstantial fissure the NDP is already struggling with In the event Jagmeet loses todays byelection the potential for a real mess exists if Mulcairs ouster is any indication personally Im afraid of what might happen I was disgusted how the party treated the man who led it to the second highest number of seats in party history who maintained a significant beachhead in Quebec without which the NDPlike any partyhas absolutely no hope of federal success who whipped Harpers ass every day in the Commons and who made the NDP the most popular party in the nation for the first time ever The effectively leadersless party also made an embarrassing hash of the illfated electoral reform committee the NDP contingent headed by the petulant Nathan Cullen whose maudlin tantrums drove polling numbers downward until the committees work was done and they began to slowly recoverthat is after hed been thus shut up And then members churlishly rebuffed Charlie Anguseasily the most qualified leadership contenderfor the shiny new and painfully novice Mr Singh I remain a membersomewhat begrudgingly because of some of our BC governmets policiesbut understand the difference between federal and provincial parties The real struggle is always at the provincial level where sovereignty over resources is at and the NDP is a viable contender for government At the federal level no matter what happens I do not expect the NDP to become government I expect it to be the conscience of parliament and continue to force progressive policy upon the bigger parties The only way it could ever be different in my view is if the Cons selfdestructed entirely But Im not a

numbers is that hes looking too conciliatory If he fired both rogue ministers out the door his numbersd probably improve It might seem perverse but citizens like toughness because it guarantees the next episode will be worth watching we are in the video age in its literal sense and have yet to conquer what we came upon over sixty years agovisual entertainment in a jiffy this is especially true during electoral contests as opposed to parliamentary ones which arent so much forkeeps and require the artifice of QP to make it the least bit watchable I did see PET in a state of fear onceI was actually shaking his hand as he stepped out of his limo which was being chased by a mob of tomatothrowing protesters I was carrying batteries for my newscameraman father But most came to know PET as irreverent and feistyeven tough just watch me I remember that so wellmy neighbours and friends in Quebec City just absolutely hated him for thatand he absolutely loved it Im sure I disagree that Harper succeeded by way of his toughguy antics he was continually knocked about by one tougher Mulcair in parliaments QP primetime which sure didnt help the NDP on Election Day that difference between parliament and elections again Perhaps if Harper had gotten tough against racism he might have avoided his crucial election fumble the niqab ploy but by trying to look tough for his base he seriously undermined his attempt to bore voters to death with one of the longest election campaign periods in modern history A missed punch saps more energy than a landed one But I saw my MLA and newlyelected leader of the BC NDP be laughed out of contention for a rookie case of stage fright in front of news media way back Not tough enough the Socredfriendly press peppered Later I saw BC NDP leader Carole James shrink from finishing Premier Gordon Campbell off when his HST lie had him squirming on the floor figuratively he actually had a 9 approval rating lower than the runnerup Richard Nixonand then try to get tough except against her own caucus members whose constituents were complaining about her passivity during this easy dirking opportunity and that nearly tore the party apart when it should have been getting its trophy pic taken over the slain dragon Then I saw my guy John Horgan suffer a whisper campaign on the convention floor during the subsequent leadership contest to replace the bounced Ms James he was said to have an uncontrollable temper this thinlyveiled prejudice against people of Irish ancestry was enough to make a fellow Gael like me lose my cool and smash some china He lost to Adrian Dix who went on to prove that while being reasonably pacific during the parliamentary phase of politics his positive politcs edict that prohibited any of his candidates to say anything negative about our rival was absolutely idiotic during the campaign phase My guy was acclaimed after Dix blew a 20point lead against the bubbleheaded Christy Clark and resigned during his abject concession speech and since Dix has subsequently made a fine minister of health all is forgivenexcept lack of toughness during campaigns can never be ever One more BC example when thenpremier Christy perfunctorily took a precampaign swipe at the new NDP leader by accusing his party of hacking her partys websitesomething a James or a Dix would not deign to respond toHorgan had a lawsuit lined up so fast it scared Christy into totally uncharacteristic civility for the remainder of the campaign she barely won a minority then lost it in the first vote in the Assembly against the two toughguys Horgan and Weaver of the Greens The lesson was that if you get punched punch back and if you punch back you wont likely get punched anymore This is apropos because we are currently in virtual election campaign mode just seven months to go My squeeze lives in Jodys riding and doesnt think she could win it as an Independent but that itll probably go Liberal anyway as it has done for a long time whomever runs there JT could fire her and not lose this ridingwhile most of the other Liberal ridings won in BC last time on promises of reconciliation and environmentalism will be lost tototouh somebody Cons NDP Greenseven Berniers Peoples Party won 11 in the recent byelection Jagmeet won mostly because of TMX which voters in the voterich Vancouver region absolutely hate I think Scheer is blowing his own advantages by endorsing neonazis and ramping his antiJT rhetoric up to levels generally regarded as lame and ridiculous Weve yet to see how tough Jagmeet will be I hadnt seen a Kirpan but heard lots of thinlyveiled racist comments about wearing religious signifiers in parliament which hes yet to attend turban and allbut Im betting he can be toughif the pacifist ideologues in Dipperland dont mind of course Is Elizabeth May tough You know it Bernier Maybe with la Meute standing behind him for whatever good thatll do himhes not bright enough to discern So how does JT stack up I think his quest for gravitas started early with his issuance of permits to accelerate the construction of the SiteC damn in BC even as Treaty 8 Nations had filed Federal Court papers to seek injunction I think he was trying to assuage fears that he was cowtowing to First Nations his reconciliation campaign rhetoric and all likewise his TMX push which as we know hasnt bought him much thanks in Alberta the province which will most bebenfit from this policybut it was rather a bid for national gravitas not regional acceptance although I wonder if he might have been trying to also reconcile Alberta with Ottawa after his father so blithely dismissed the provinces objection to the National Energy Program Rookie naivety perhaps I dunnosure hasnt got him much So all of this notwithstanding the measure of JTs toughness will be made it looks likeif nothing else pops up upon his handling of the SNCLavalin affair Or should I say how he handles the two rogue ministers It seems there must have been some conspiracy between the two which is why I think Philpott resigned to avoid cabinet crossexamination that might prove her culpability specifically that she egged Jody on to act like a toughguy Perhaps JT is prudently awaiting further discoveries in this respectlike who else might be involvedbefore bringing the hammer down Hes the leader he has to do something And cranking up the toughguy aspect on this or any issue probably wont hurt him one bit I agree its more likely to help,0.057492,0.35802343

strategy has been to seed policies which take more years than a single term of government to fruit while at the same time tending to the garden of public enterprise and services during a drought of petroleum revenues The voters who elected her however were much more tactical and may turn as many ways and as many times as they want during a single term of government Last election their prime motivation was to turn a tired government of fortyodd years out of office itd been stumbling for a decade and evaporated completely after the NDPs upset victory It might well have been that many voters didnt give much thought to what an NDP government would do but rather figured it couldnt do much worse than the one they just rejected and could be gotten rid of before any grannystate policies could come into fruition after which a reformed party of the right could then be re elected In the equivocal way of the right these days voters can parry with the fact that the party of the right in Alberta contention right now is not really a conservative party they might expect it to be by countering that neither is the NDP what they expected it to be There thinking process of your average voter done What voters who are likely to vote UCP expect is a pipeline to the West Coast and expansion of bitumen mining Thus if theres any hope of Notley winning a second termas her strategy demandsshe has to get a pipeline together and expand bitumen mining in order to capture enough of voters of practical as opposed to ideological partisanshipthat is tactical fairweather partisanship Having substantially done the preparationto an extent unprecedented by any conservative governmentshe has to present her party to voters as the little engine that could I thinkwecan Ithinkwecan Ithinkwecan while pointing eagerly to measures already accomplished again not insubstantial and superlative to anything hitherto To any voters not mentally paralyzed by chauvinismand the PCs defeat means there must be some at least sometimestheir attention if gotten must turn thence from those accomplishments to the question of the NDPs ostensible longterm commitment to the bitumen industry They might even be pleasantly surprised for the moment but be as easily swayed to UCP cynicism that no matter what the parkedvote NDP says or does its simply a trick to sneak in higher taxes in Alberta the traditional salestax bogeyman is now joined with the carbon tax promote gay lifestyles and abortions and generally botch up even a reasonable plan for the bitumen industry One has to wonder if the NDP could have captured the default vote if it had promised anything other than the status quo position on bitumen mining and dilbit pipelines Once it did win that default vote what could Notley possibly do but compete directly with Jason KeKKennys UCP for the blueribbon Biggest Bitumen Booster prize Was there any other strategy for her but winning more than one mandate I have my sympathies for Ms Notleys predicamnet But it stops at the targeted vitriol towards BC If shes decided to parry with KeKKenny for the same turf she should have targeted him instead He might criticize spending public dollars for the demonization propagandabut only hypocritically because it tops what his party has to spend doing exactly what hed like to do if he held the public purse strings To his mind thats unfair and of course if he ever does win power itll justify righteous revenge by spending even more on the same thing and demonizing everything that could possibly be connected to the NDP Dont worry there wont be any pipeline built before the next Alberta election likely this spring and if Kekkenney wins hell claim the credit for whatever part of it looks successful and blame JT and Notley for what doesnt Naturally KeKKenney would pay for this kind of selfserving stuff by cutting social servicesat least Ms Notley contrast with him in this respect So the NDP can only win by winning the next election as mentioned above an NDP Opposition wouldnt have an environmental leg to stand on when criticizing UCP pipeline and bitumen mining expansion Does Notley have to worry about the Greens After burning environmental bridges behind her I should think so but probably not so much from the Alberta Greens rather from BC federal Greens where Ms Mays riding is and to which one provincial Green seat attached geographically then two more contiguously all on the Island which now hold the balance of power in the BC Assembly With opposition to TMX so strong on the Coast I expect the federal Greens will continue to prosper there Hey they could double their seats And lets remember that the BC NDP minority government the BC Greens support has disappointed and angered Dipper environmentalists with respect LNG pipelines the SiteC dam fishfarm policy and other things Given that stiffening opposition to TMX and shipping dilbit through inside waters is of primary concern to Albertans its worth their consideration whether the Greens continue to ascend provincially in BC Its too early yet to speculate about the next BC election scheduled for Spring 2021 we have Albertan Canadian and American

about as bright as TVs Sheldon Cooper A stiff ostrichnecked socially backward lecturing twit  the ideal Conservative he completely believes in himself and the rubbish he spews Rigidminded Cons seem to sprout fullyformed out of thin air in Alberta but this one only appeared as a fullblown nitwit with regressive views at the advanced age of 14 you say Must have been charming around the home and at school His tone on TV was about all I could take without getting angry at his smug haughtiness and racism If anyone disagrees with them the standard Con response is to say that such folk are socialistleftists are highly argumentative and incoherent and wont engage in civil discussion Right out of Playbook 101 of the Conservative mindset Disagreement with nitwiticism means youre argumentative and uncivil Of course Thats because Cons are always correct in their twisted illogical minds not subject to doubt or to ever acknowledge other viewpoints as valid so mere disagreement with them means youre uncivil Deep brainpower at work Then they sit down in selfrealized triumph and figure theyve won an intellectual battle while looking smug It would be comedy hour if it werent so serious Another trope is to proclaim that anyone to the left of them is socialist and invoke the spectre of Commie hordes and immigrants overrunning the land and carrying off the daughters of decent citizens and we all know commies and socialists are godless authoritarian technocrats who want to order people around dont we Yes indeed social democracy is evil dontcha know In fact of course its the Cons who want to order everyone around and place people in slots of social hierarchy where they can be picked off individually as unreliable if they even squawk a little bit at crap treatment for the

didnt like it always rationalized it as we had to go to stop Hitler and no matter how much anyone might agree I always felt he really meant we had to commit the sin of killing to stop an even bigger sinner Otherwise he didnt say much about itnot like plenty of other vets Ive hoisted a few with who for whatever reason liked to brag about their exploits how many Huns they killed and how they did it I think his first lowlevel flight over Berlin this time bringing humanitarian aid at the end of the War really affected him indescribable destructionand the human suffering that must have gone on They were the enemy but I dont think he ever forgave himself He was in the airforce One thing he did say not infrequently was that we never would have won without the Russians as he always called the Soviet Union After all it was Imperial Russia when he was a small boy and old school books probably hadnt been updated out in the Ontario sticksat least not a quickly as the Soviets did theirs after their Revolution in 1917 99 of Russians were illiterate within ten years 99 were literate the central government seized what school books there could have been in such an illiterate country and reissued properly censored ones eliminating fully half the lexicon of a once great language bourgeois words out and almost a quarter of the alphabet school books were completely renewed every five years Its true most of us have only heard the Western Front version of the War DDay naturally being centre stage The narrative we made of the East was biased by different streams of animosity toward the Soviet Union First was the foreshadowing of Dostoyevskys novels describing the inhuman treatment of serfs in Tsarist Russia probably next is the littleknown intervention by Western Allies in 191820 when Canada joined with the USA and Britain and a number of European and Asian nations yes Japanese regulars fought in Siberia to invade Russia from East and North whilst it convulsed in civil war The Reds won and the losers us preferred not to mention it ever againperhaps with a touch of irony this harrowing strugglea completely undeclared war didnt make it into school books about the Great War WW I But Im sure Soviet schoolboys knew about it Next came the Sovietstyle Holocaust the Holodomor or mass starvation of millions of kulaks who refused to cooperate with farm collectivization during the 30s in Ukraine Stalins murderous reputation was fully developed by the time WW II came along In retrospect theres an aspect of the Cold War red scare that Western schoolboys might have found disturbinghad they been given the opportunity to read about it the Soviets spurred by Stalins deep paranoia and naturally the Nazis attack actually achieved the most rapid economic and industrial development of all time That little factoid certainly didnt jibe with anticommunism propaganda But of course things like the Intervention and Sovietstyle crashindustrialization like a lot of stuff didnt make it into our school books in the West I was lucky enough to study Russian language which I love sos to read the classics in original tongue Ive since lost this ability through nonuseI could probably get it back Russian is easy the Soviets made it so there are no exceptions to grammatical rules Im also fascinated by the equivalent pioneering between Canada and Russia how many here know that Russians had their own cowboys Cossacks and Indians the native peoples of Sibir As fascinating is Russias problems with northern developmentmany similarities with Canadas Russia Ive bothered to learn is a great nation with a history that was as important for Europe as it was for them the Christian bulwark against Asiatic Hordes and of course its importance in WW II which like my Dad always said was critical to our eventual victory But ignorance in the West seems mostly to be in not really getting how devastating the War was for ordinary Russians and other

stat from the paper to me over breakfast one morning twenty percent of Canadians dislike Americans He thought it humorous when I quipped more like twenty percent of each Canadian dislikes Americans Many years later I was reminded of my nowdeparted fatherinlaws laughter when JTs popularity surged through no effort of his own but rather merely because Donald tRump had publicly insulted him in where else a tweet post Gwhiz conference calling our PM dishonest and weak and You cant do that to me Justingonna cost Canadians a lot of money Indeed within nanoseconds Canadian Conservatives pivoted in their normally derisive tone toward our PMthat is they assumed a straightbacked if insincere patriotic tone politically forced to marshal to his defence My fatherinlaw would have laughed at that bit of theatre too because it rather illustrated my point even neoliberaladdled neorightists understand the deep abiding enmity most if not all Canadians feel towards our greatest ally and trading partner I felt the rankle recently for example when tRumps stupid tariff threat against Mexico was reported by US news media as a threat against Americas largest trading partner Mexicoby PBS no lessbecause as every Canadian knows that superlative still belongs with our country and as usual we take exception to the slightest American sleight I was astounded when Con leader Andrew Scheer appeared to endorse neoNazis during an antiTrudeau truck rally What a huge mistake I thought as I awaited abject apology for being captured in news video with antiimmigration dogwhistle frequencyloweredtranslation  antiimmigrant protesters carrying placards emblazoned with demands to hang yes hang by the neck until dead the young PM for of all things treason I just pray JTs children didnt have to see it on TV But darned if I wasnt even more astounded when Scheer appeared unapologetic and indeed has subsequently been associated by way of his own MPs and copartisan provincial politicians with acts and statements that tend to confirm this resort to odious ageold demagoguery against the perennial imaginary Other Not only that its just sooooo American especially since the ascent of Donald T Rump What in the world are all these Canadian neorightists thinking when they proudly read from the tRumpian playbook Are they tempting fate Wait a minute I hear some people saying the tRump playtweet works pretty well After all The Orange One did win the presiduncy and some of his Canadian apers of The Orange have employed his Twitterisms to victorious electoral effect namely Albertas Jason KeKKenney and Ontarios Dohfo I suppose it might look like the tRump playbook works pretty well from a certain pointofview like to paraphrase Einstein if one imagines looking at the world while riding the leading edged of a beam of shite Remind that none of these twitter twits has completed a single fouryear term JKKKs only begun his Dohfo just a year in and The Donald in his third IMHO well have to wait see if their respective electorates think of their terms as working pretty well And it rather seems it hasnt not so much in the US of A nor in Ontario where the Dohfos popularity has tanked below that of his vanquished predecessor whod held the recordlow rating hitherto Albertas tRumperoid government is still too new to tell how much voters will approve of the irritable snarling mien their premier has costumed them on the world stage Forgive me if I cant think of a Canadian equivalent to Yosemite Sam With talk of Alberta separatism still circulating on social media I dont think JKKK quite qualifies anyway But I agree on the national level the distended twittering bowels of the American manchild do present a frightful possibility that we Canadians will become like or more likeinstead of merely apingour American cousins But remember we have the benefit I cant believe Im saying this of having had the HarperCons take ten deep breathsokay of which our American neighbours had never seen the likeuntil now with tRump Remember how well Harpers tactics worked by the time he won a majority his government was beset by prosecutions for electoral cheating his lacklustre legislation was regularly being struck down by the SCoC his centrepiece pipeline policy turned into a pipe dream and the First Nations he tried to railroad had organized the most spontaneous nationwide protest movement in Canadian history IdleNoMore which nailed that door shut with a single log across the transcontinental railway track Then his first majority was his last Theres more evidence that tRump JKKK and Dohfo will meet this same fate that not Why so surprised Theyre all ideological neoright absurdists who yield net negatives for ordinary citizens Nothing they prescribe will ameliorate the challenges of our times Certainly not the imaginary ones Im waiting for the Orange One to insert himself into the Canadian federal election If it doesnt occur to him maybe an anybodybutCon sympathizer will put the twitter bug in his ear As it happens the lengthy nature of US presidential elections has coincidentally linedup our two nations federal contests side by side like Ben Hur and Massala which is a good thing IMHO because as if we dont already sniff up our smug Canadian sleeves at American political crudity it will remind us of what The Orange goofs Canadian apers especially its browndwarf star in this darkening political atmospherehave in mind for our fair country Its a gonna be some great TV As the Dems lose their shirts and loose their skirts

variety still so enmeshed in the social mores of 70 years ago but whatever scheme Kenney and the Brains Trust are dreaming up in warrooms filled with wood smoke has so far been dashed on the rocks of a metaphorical seaswept shore and dissipated without effect Not a soul of my acquaintance has paid the slightest bit of attention to yet more Alberta whining a feature for fully forty years on the Canadian political landscape and which blindly passes them by as background noise much as they do not really notice repeated climate change pronouncements The populace is stuffed to the gills with messages from people advocating this and that and rarely watches standard news broadcasts on TV  local news is far more popular People watch Trump if he makes some outlandish assertion just to see if the worlds as nuts as they already thought it was Everyones online chattering away about nothing in particular for pleasure and avoidance of reality and lining up their own news items if they even have an interest in that direction Political disengagement reigns supreme Who wants to be constantly surrounded by depressing BS and intoning bigheads given their druthers The exception is older folk boomers whose habits from decades of practice still encompass a spot of national TV news A lot of progressive bloggers are older people who can for the most part still spell write a sentence organize paragraphs and present a logical unity of thought in a post Younger ones tend to often present a Youtube video made by someone else that they more or less agree with I personally cannot sit around waiting for some pontificator to get to the point when an essay could be read in a quarter the time and if some point becomes unclear then it is easy to refer back to an earlier paragraph Searching back on a video or podcast is an exercise in frustration that makes one forget the point due to mechanicslousy interfaces interfering with the message So Ersatz Sub Pope Jason The First of Alberta can shake the secession flag as much as he wants and threaten doom but I daresay the 88 of Canadians who arent Albertans couldnt care less barring some BCers who dont feel they should be forced to buy into Albertas dream of exporting more diluted bitumen and nascent CO2 through their patch to nonexistent Asian markets like the Mayor of Burnaby itself no mere hamlet No amount of screaming and hollering about Albertas rights from Jason is going to change their minds just as unctuously pompous judicial decisions upholding some outofdate provincial rights statute made 150 years ago and of little relevance to todays realities hold little sway either The situation may well come to the fore if the feds illadvisedly bring in platoons of RCMP or heaven forbid the troops to basically shut down all protest as the new pipeline is built The average social media chatterers will awake and wonder what the hell is going on It will also become obvious that the dissenting portion of the publics view is for naught against the state and all the fine words of democracy amount to nothing when moneys at stake Who knows how things will unfold Will Canadians be as acquiescent to naked displays of power as Italians and Germans of 90 years ago were and keep their heads down with the blame shovelled onto indigenous heads for conveniences sake I believe its all quite unclear since there are endless tangents for either side to exploit to confuse the masses And nascent storm troopers with highly racist views panting to give anyone who disagrees a black eye or worse are massing on the sidelines scratching their armpitz ready to rumble at any sign of discord to fulfil their blighted agendas Personally I dont give two tosses if Alberta secedes Nowhere else except in parts of Quebec have I ever encountered such incuriosity at how other Canadians live All the commentary is inwardturned and after picking out the lint from their bellybuttons the resulting exposed navel becomes of surpassing interest to the exclusion of anyone elses The constant din about the downturn of Albertas oil patch is belied by production figures which constantly trend upwards as anyone who examines production figures available on the NEB webpages can see But nobody in power in Alberta wants facts they want a fight to win to lord it over others as we further poison ourselves deny Insurance Industry nearterm forecasts of 20 less moisture in the West and 20 more in the East delivered by gutwrenching storms even as the West burns and crops fail Let us not debate facts say those pols lets argue and fight instead and ignore the looming outcome of what they have allowed and caused to be done Weve reached a stage where many things are coming to a head Will we decide to shoot ourselves in the foot and claim lt feels really good Or will someone with a bit of gravitas and reason come to the fore and guide us through our travails Past experience and history which holds little interest for most these days and is thereby dismissed out of hand argue for the darker force of special interests to prevail Lots of money can buy lots of propaganda We want to be supremely happy as we choke ourselves to death while in thrall to the quick buck desecrators of our sovereign resources I mean they owe us that much in return right,0.089974,0.39637032

better anything doesnt matter whatoutweighing the prayer mumbled on the halfwing The Greens are the only party that can possibly benefit from this pervasive political malaise of oursbut as you point out theyre too small yet to take full advantage Did Osama bin Laden win Is the cacophonous colossus of the West about to meet its historian with China having patiently awaited its revenge for the Opium War and Boxer Rebellion flooding the Streets of the Laredo with deadly cheap fentanyl and the Russians availing the economies of socialmedia scale to interfere with democracy on the cyber cheap The Great Bogey Man theory of history is tempting there being so many that one or another can be found and erected a milestone for nearly any bracketed epoch Suffice to say that the beginning of this malaise coincided with the attack on the Twin Towers lo these nineteen years ago but that myriad factors like climate change social impoverishment and Neoliberal play for all the marbles all related have been important too Still the correlation between the kind of democratic risktaking we see now and palpable geopolitical unrest is fairly weak During the infamous inter World War period for example political strain was rather expressed by partisan diversity whereas today post911 the expression has not so much inspired new parties but rather amplified wishful attempts to return to better timeseven ones that never really existed or at least only in very particular ways generally unattainable today All sorts of charlatans have ascended the ladder lately disguised as politicians of the

been talking about climate change lately Somebody once said it doesnt matter what they say about climate change just so longs they talkin about whether its weather or not The pseudoCons have really conned themselves on this phenomenon by embracing the perennially dissatisfied instead of the newly disaffected therell always be pissedoff rednecks wholl defend their pickup trucks and who dislike foreigners even Canadian ones but its not apparent there are any more of them than there is a quickly growing number of voters disturbed by political inaction on issues affecting them right now like income disparity and environmental degradation Nothing exposes the neorightists as charlatans more than the fact they have nothing to return to of their ownsince they never were conservative in any way except name anyhow Make Canada Great Again for Scheer means Make Canada Harpers Again Anybody whos paid attention knows that era was a retrogressive bust that never would have happened if Harper had been a real Tory and not a neoliberal usurper and saboteur of Canadian democratic sovereignty Too bad for Andrew because theres plenty of disappointed voters out there he might have appealed to instead of recklessly inviting neoNazis and religious whackos into the party These are the representatives I guess of the good ole days hed like to return to While many dissatisfied voters truly do want a return to more equitable healthier times Scheer incredibly produced a climate action plan ostensibly prescriptive that completely ignores the causes of climate change because presumably hes become too far committed to the snarling extremists already recruited to make up for his partys natural attrition and abandonment by moderate conservativescounterintuitively slogans for all their simplicity are extremely difficult for extremists to exchange A real leader would have focused on building a more ethically stable baseeven if it required forfeiting a mandate or two JT is retro to begin with thats the main reason he won people longed for a time before the HarperCons ruined so much of our political decorum and JTs name reminded of a certain pirouetted irreverence that outraged the Cons of the day because they were real Conservatives who believed in decorum Nationalistic tinkering with Albertas petroleum resource is what got JTs father so hated in the West At least its a real past regardless its dubious attainability by way of nationalized pipelines today Score one for the Kid His attempt at looking forward at least pays lip service to voters concernsand it sounded great until proved hollow in the four years following his landmark victory He can say at least he tried but its been for all that another example of risktaking by a frustrated electorate Dippers got so mad at their leader for taking the neoright globe into account Mulcair had the unforgivable audacity to propose a balanced budget and for not unfurling the red flag that they fired him despite having won the second highest number of seats in their partys history under his leadership and amazingly retaining many of the Quebec seats theyd first won by mere default during the same Liberal collapse that gave us Harper Frustrated risktalking Hows about electing a leader who would not be allowed to perform public service in the province that supplies over a third of his caucusand who definitely will not be unfurling his Sikh turban anytime soon Its hard to discern whether the move is progressive or merely progressively frustrated It is dangerous times when the antipolitician is so advantaged by widespread voter frustration It may be that what doesnt kill you makes you stronger but having survived Harper and for me here in BC the BC Liberals Im not sure were in such strong condition right nowat least not yet I look at progressive moves in such an environment as hopeful if not yet entirely helpful It wouldnt surprise me if it takes all of nineteen years from the ousters

Justin Trudeau JTlite was only ever halflighted by the niqabblack darkness of Stephen Harper from whom The Kid seized power in an improbable comefrombehind election campaign which the rookie leader of a recently thirdplaced party encapsulated in his victory maxim Sunny ways my friends and sunny days The new PM gave us the shaft of sunlight after the red hot poker of HarperNacht The vast majority of Canadians rejoiced in relief that the Con base was not so deep But even low relief casts long shadows in the obliqueness of this mandates setting sun and the acting CEO of the shadow cabinet now searches as frantically as a blind man in the fleeting umbra of the thin dusky wedge a silhouette on sable for any opaqueness his predecessors better might have cast during his incredible lightness of being the Sunny Boy of Canadian politics During the incredibly long election writ period Harper arranged in order to blunt potentially embarrassing news from the concurrent Mike Duffy trial Canadians heard a surfeit of allegations that JT was just not ready to govern a complex country like Canada As true as that might have turned out the youngest contender was definitely not ready to concede to a Senate Harperthug in the ring nor to secondplace HarperCon or firstplace MulcairDipper geezers in the running whom he blew past while cheerily turning cartwheels and handsprings a pirouette would have been a bit too pretentious perhaps A deep desire for change among the electorate and a sort of endorsement from a father whose fame transcends even death certainly didnt detract from the young candidates gladhanding Nevertheless betting on a leader of such light credentials required hedging whence the promised legalization of Marijuana and electoral reform Both promises should have been shoeins the first given that medical Cannabis had already been protected by the courts and technically illegal recreational pot had been openly retailed from storefronts with relative impunity for years was almost a throwaway cookie of relatively little political riskand it was literally mothers milk for the Christmas Baby JT But electoral reform was played very poorly We dont yet know what cynical politics might have come into play here but the unworkability of JTs campaign promise that FPtP would be eliminated for some other system TBA should have been a tell perhaps because it was promised so early in the campaign long before hed started to eclipse his superior rivals nobody really noticed actual lightness camouflaged by presumed lightness Doubtless many voted for JTs ER promise and perhaps as many will not again in their disappointment sharpened by the notion that such an unlikely victor should have also had the capacity to implement a new electoral system forthwith without the referendum despite every survey suggested 75 of Canadians wanted one with FPtP on the ballot not disqualified as hed so foolishly or cynically proposed Again the two possibilities allow lightness to be disguised as the kind of political shrewdness we too often forgive as necessary mendacity A cynical ploy to dupe the Cons on the special ER Committee into relieving JT of his illconsidered  promise would at least also relieve its otherwise apparent lightness Maybe its more than mere coincidence that the Cons can hardly make hay of what might be judged one of JTs most egregious and consequential failures they could I guess claim to have saved Canada from proportional representation or whatever it might have been but not without looking like theyd been manipulated when the Liberals relinquished their majority on the Committee into the role just so JT could escape his promise as hed planned all along Winwin Mr Sunshine But the compensating errors of fortune have been working incessantly to show the PM has been relying as heavily on luck as he has been on the advice of others for good or bad Rather he cant show hes capable of telling the difference and the SNCLavalinRaybouldPhillpot scandal proved it The Sunny Boy persona the new PM cowed to The Donald might have been as light and trite as all that and an impolitic risk given that more than 20 of Canadians hate American politicsactually its more likely 20 of each dobut making nice with tRump simply cannot be labeled as imprudent For all his showy obsequiousness and sycophancy JT ended up getting dirkedwhich doesnt necessarily shine a light on his lightness given The Orange One had dirked almost everybody around him anyways Indeed Trumps weakness and dishonesty aspersions cast at the PM have already formed part of Con rhetoric they doubtlessly happy it doesnt appear too much like its been lifted directly from tRumps playbook But it remains that the Trudeau government saw to it that the CMustD has been nearly ratified at least for Canadas part on condition that US tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum are lifted Most of this was the work of Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland who had to endure at least as much public boorishness from the President as JTand probably endured much much more behind closed doors in negotiation Her affectionate loyalties paid assiduously to and her fierce unstinting defences of the PM are overtly selfconfident and maybe one day politically ambitious she wouldnt have been able to shine as much as she has without JTs nod yet shes careful not to let her successes look like leadership flows uphill even if it actually did in this instance Shes content for now to let JT bask in the solar spotlight that magically refuses to reveal too many warts and wrinkles or to fade despite many anvil clouds scudding across the horizon In pipeliners affirmative activists and Aboriginal leaders JT seems to trust to reveal his dependence on naive trust which in this sense is well matched with his main rivals and I suppose better than appearing paranoid like Trump or Harper Still it betrays a certain ineptitude about realpolitik we expect at least from the PMO if not the PM himself With regard the SNCLavalin debacle it looks like somebody didnt know what they were doing amongst the tangle of political marionette strings not Jody not even the PMO nor for sure JT himself Nothing good came out of this for the PMexcept maybe that he got rid of two insubordinates But maybe some of the dirked knew what they were doingmaybe Jane did maybe Jody but most definitely McCallum he knows a lot maybe too much to be an ambassador perhaps thats why Chrystia was so quick to refute his astute observations Maybe she had to do it so JT wouldnt have learn how to Nevertheless the arrest and pending extradition of Chinese national Meng Wanzhou might be construed as incredible lightness on JTs partafter all it would have been so simple to explain to the Whitehousewhich naturally wants to trump diplomacy for tRumps partisan gain by scapegoating Ms Mengs Chinese company during the USChina tariff warthat Ms Meng has had to be released on a technicality discovered in the extradition filing which legally prevented Canadian border agents from keeping her in the country We note much has changed since JT submitted to American demands to arrest Ms Meng the PM now coughs loudly in the Presidents presence knowingly riling the infamous germaphobebut in the sunniest way possible knowing the Orange One has descended too far down the dark karmic ladder to retaliate much farther than against those immediately surrounding him in the Whitehouse Sunny days my friendscough Certainly the Harpershadows shadow has seized upon this sabretooth in a tarpit with foolhardy courage he wont get trapped in the ethical goo himself Thank goodness DJC has put paid to that faint hope What nobody seems to be considering is that sunny ways and sunny days having gotten JT this far and no amount of hesnotready has much dented him yet he may electperhaps as seems usual with or without good adviceto continue his incredible lightness of being PMand leave us wondering still if he for example simply releases Ms Meng to provoke criticism from tRump that can only help his election campaign on patriotic grounds as did tRumps weak and dishonest accusation to JTs popularity polls or put an electoral reform referendum question on the general election ballot at the last moment to atone for the ER debacle JT can still do either if he wants or needs Maybe leaving that option open is why Canadian officials simply didnt warn Ms Meng to stay out of Canada letting her know the extradition request would be pressed if she did enter the country Or maybe they really wanted to cynically bait tRump to contrast in their sunny bosss favour If JT can hang on by any means his lightness of being PM will have become credible But what about the Canadian prisoners held ransom in Chinese prisons They desperately want to see the lightness of ordinary daylight,0.068493,0.24513267

cognitive bias of availability Everybodys trying to get onto the bandwagon these days evil Big Pharma has been allegedly making a lot of money from the opioid epidemic or crisis as its now inaccurate to called itthe normalized spate of fatal overdoses caused by superpotent fentanyl manufactured and distributed entirely by criminal organizations Ignoring that Big Pharma doesnt profit from the manufacture and distribution of illegallymade fentanyl state and federal and now provincial governments want some of Big Pharmas astounding profits anyway Canadian governments have been climbing up on the bandwagon toomaybe twenty years late but hey this is Canada the Good where we dont litigate near so much as our American neighbours Just a couple years ago Nova Scotia joined a class action against Perdue Pharma the New England company that lied to US federal regulators about its new OxyContin opioid not being addictive in order to get it licensed and making money more recently the new government of BC announced it would be suing Big Pharma for aggressively marketing licensed opioids because the Crown argues it caused the illegallymade fentanyl crisis that has killed thousands of British Columbians over the past few years How Big Pharma as disingenuous as its been shown in many ways is connected to organized crime which makes and peddles illegal fentanyl and has no inclination to share any of its own profits said to be 20fold more than achievable by peddling traditional poppyderived heroin is something that requires all the unlikeliness of conspiracy theory as its popularly conceived the more obtuse the better Indeed any attempt to float the notion that a Canadian government can succeed in such a lawsuit requires the confusion of more than one conspiracy theory to be judged plausible instead of merely imitative or politically fashionable As fatalities would have it just such a confusion is available and has been since the original OxyContin fraud of 1996 That Perdue Pharma conspired to lie about its new products addictiveness in order to profit more is a theory so evident that the company has paid over a billion dollars in fines and US court settlements Many US and Canadian doctors overprescribed OxyContin on this vested interests false claim although their professional lapse was probably less conspiratorial in and of itself it was eventually augmented by a more deliberate conspiracy when physicians colleges rationalized an acrosstheboard policy of cracking down on opioid prescription in order to dodge culpability in their members patently unprofessional prescribing and neglecting to monitor plain symptoms of addictive behaviour in their patients To pull this off required yet another conspiracy one that emphasized Perdues own culpability and absolved doctors one that also had to blame patients instead as liars and drugseekers and opioids themselves which were alleged to be too addictive to safely prescribe for anything except the most severe pain caused by terminal illness that is patients were alleged to have somehow conspired to force supposedly reluctant doctors to prescribe them their dope and doctors only succumbed to the political pressure All by conspiratorial necessity As with the fractal nature of lying to explain previous lies conspiracy theories require adding more obtuse conspiracies to explain morebyzantine conspiracies As such patients had to be also blamed for diverting their prescribed opioids onto the streets in order so the theory goes to get money to purchase opioids sold illicitly on the streets in spite of the obvious dangers and that some of the opioids marketed on the streets were the very same prescribed opioids allegedly diverted by these supposedly dishonest patients Unfortunately for the theorists virtually all prescription lookalikes seized on Canadian streets by police have proved to be counterfeits laced with illegallymade fentanyl not diverted prescriptions as the colleges had premised Plaintiffs never want to be accused of conspiracy rather they want to show how theyve been conspired against The colleges handpicked witnesses typically supplied anecdotes that they got hooked after being prescribed opioids for a sports injury implausibly an athlete going directly from say T3s to abjectly injecting illicit street heroin now laced with deadly illegallymade fentanyl Short of hard data to substantiate this theoretical overgenerality the colleges omitted that any of these witnesses naturally try to shift blame away from themselves In fact nobody has ever shown that 95 of patients dont safely benefit from opioid prescription nor that they get addicted or divert their meds onto the streets or would ever go there to get opioids refused them by doctors A collision of theories was necessary if doctors were to claim victimization by Big Pharma and absolve themselves from culpability overprescribing while submitting testimonials of similar but leapfrogged victimhood from users who were actually most likely to blame for their own addiction to street drugs Good thing everyone expects conspiracy theories to be a bit fantasticeveryone except users overdosing on illegallymade fentanyl and legitimate patients hurt by the unwarranted crackdown Crisscrossing conspiracy theories are still in effect today One type is American police seizures of street drugs regularly confirm legitimately manufactured opioids are finding their way onto the streets sparking class action lawsuits against manufacturers like Perdue which state prosecutors allege should have and probably did suspect wholesale shipments of OxyContin are far in excess of normal medical need Donald tRump has latched onto the lawsuit bandwagon to address the opioid overdose epidemic in his country and to look like hes actually doing something other than bullshitting all the time The theory is that Big Pharma is knowingly trying to addict American patients in order to sell more product BC Premier John Horgans lawsuit against Big Pharmas Canadian subsidiaries is similar and must also be politically motivated because the basic accusation doesnt stand up very well when the theory is tested unlike in the USA the amount of diverted prescriptions found on Canadian streets is vanishingly small and after all an arbitrary crackdown on opioid prescription had been in effect for two years by the time Horgan instructed his AG to file papers with the courts proving the crackdown had made not one dint in the overdose epidemic and thence diminishing the argument that prescriptions are significantly correlated to use of street drugs the crackdown did harm legitimate patients who were caught up in this game the BC Colleges crackdown has since been rescinded with the additional proviso that doctors may not drop patients from their practices simply to avoid prescribing opioid medicine they need as they had started to do when the crackdown was implemented The point is Horgan is trying to cross one conspiracythe uniquely American onewith anotherthe Canadian one that alleges the majority of users of street opioids the principal victims of illegallymade fentanyl initially became addicted by way of overprescription therefore Big Pharma is culpable even though its always been a doctors responsibility to observe longstanding protocols for safely prescribing opioids The suit I guess claims advertising by manufacturers like Perdue somehow illegally induced doctors to break their own medical standards In any case BC wants to recover expenses it has incurred dealing with the overdoes epidemic No conspiracy yet to make clean safe opioid prescription available to users so they dont have to risk all by using fentanylcontaminated dope more than a theory this approach is working in their jurisdictions Unfortunately Horgans pursuit of Big Pharma opioid profits is delaying better ways to deal with the ongoing epidemic which kills streetdrug users every single day in BC despite the lawsuits prospectswhich are very poor and far off anyways Its a political posture that buys his government time court cases

Program NEP 20 upon first dimpled blush uses the fathers first NEP 10 to simply dwarf his sons TMX proposal simply arguing how a Canadian taxpayergifted pipeline for Alberta to export diluted bitumen through can possibly be a bad thing a simply notgoodenough thingindeed so insulting to Alberta that its government has set up a war room to defend itself against a sinister international conspiracy to landlock its primary resource bitumenas if TMX doesnt exist or if it does simply insufficiently by dastardly design as if Canada didnt buy out Kinder Morgans Transmountain TM pipelinetwinning expansion project TMX to the tune of 45 billion with another doubledigit billiondollar funding commitment to construct it a national investment that almost entirely benefits Alberta As usualand tried and truethe simple narrative simply ignores any others veracity notwithstanding so that the focus remains transfixed on the empty shell now you see pea now you dont similarly to the generic Hail Mary gospel that redacts the realities of dilbitexport policy rendering and slakingoff a number of exceptions to the Alberta UCP governments nationalcrisis narrative like for example the fact that if the same export proposal were to terminate at the Port of Prince Rupertwhere North Americas secondlargest deep harbour opens directly into deep open ocean as opposed to navigating hundreds of kilometres through the inside marine waters of BC and Washington Stateinstead of at Burnaby opposition to it would be considerably maybe even vitally less The UCPs crisis narrative replete with warnings of Balkanization and threats of separatismsimply ignores the fact that many West Coast opponents to TMX arent so much against bitumen development or export per se but rather to the route proposed It doesnt matter to JKKK if a West Coaster supports dilbit export just not through TMX but Prince Rupert instead he or she will still be cast as a selfish hypocritical undemocratic ruleoflaw breaking pointyeared dupe of shadowy international environmental terrorists who deserves to be Balkanized as mercilessly as possible Scheer offers the prospect of using corridored NEP 20 electricity too The palpable element of revenge of course harkens back to NEP 10 Albertas de rigueur lodestone of fedbashing personified by any Trudeau who might be Prime Minister at the time Back in premier Lougheeds day of real Toryism the issue wasnt so much government interference in free marketshe was defending Albertas sovereignty which to the real Tory mind grants the jurisdiction to skim off a tidy royalty from the conventional oil industry and save it in a Heritage Fund in anticipation of the day when the oil runs out the profitability of bitumen mining without massive government subsidies of which real conservatives would have disapprovedwas then still a question The worldwide usurpation of Tory polities by stateless neoliberals which summarily swapped Adam Smith for Gordon Gecko ushered in a totally unTory era when sovereignty defers to capitalism instead of the other way around and government intervention in the economysuch as Scheers NEP 20 envisions is rather intended to bankrupt the state so its forced by penury to acquiesce to the demands of international investorsthe guys whom the states weakened sovereignty cannot prevent or incent them from simply moving their money elsewhere as weve heard ad nauseam ever since buying into NAFTAs bill of goods Premier Lougheeds opposition to NEP 10 was a matter of sovereignty provincial versus federal which harkened back to a quartercentury period when Albertas with concurrently confederated Saskatchewan federal relationship was truly unfair it didnt have full sovereignty over natural resources the defining feature of provincial sovereigntysharing with the feds the discrepancy was remedied in the early 30sbefore the Canadian Constitution was patriated in 1982 by an Act of the British Parliament Most Albertans probably didnt recall this historical vignette during the NEP 10 controversy much less now looking back through the stack of lenses NEP 10 TMX and now NEP 20 Neither Lougheed nor Scheer need Alberta voters to remember arcane constitutional arguments they can avail one of the most potent narratological devices the inheritance from father to son here performed by PET and JT to kaleidoscopically moulinex fact fable legend and myth into the superficial warpaint of slogan and paean That is Scheer better hope nobody looks too closely at his NEP 20 proposal else it get waylaid by inconvenient truths there surely is an international conspiracy afoot against combusting any kind of petroleum into the atmosphere but far from sinister and secretive as the UCP government mischaracterizes it it is dexterous and righteously overt but that storyline doesnt very well work with the UCPs victimcard arc that shadowy evil forces are covertly focusing on Albertas bitumen alone unfairly singling it out Albertans react so predictably to this fabulously maudlin official propaganda that a naturally begrudging urban mythof which the UCP government does not disabuse its citizensthat the province is not only being unfairly treated now but has been all along which inevitably further developed in the fora of cafes and bars morphs into the notion that therefore Alberta has been unfairly taxed all along and thence to the attitude that Canada actually owes Alberta large for every perceived sleight Its entirely the UCPs fault as coordinator of the antcarbon tax conservative provincial confederacy at propagator of factfree praisethelordpasstheammo paeans that the ROCIQ Including Quebec looks at Alberta this way By signing on to this growing increasingly singular narrative Scheer risks getting run over by snowballing codswallop If his proposed NEP 20 corridor must be expropriated from provincial territory hes gonna need some cooperation threading NEP 20 through BC and Quebec both of which have opposed dilbitpiping although BC is uniquely concerned with dilbit spills from supertankers plying its busy inside marine waters unlike Quebec which simply opposes a pipeline traversing its jurisdiction will present as the ancient Chinese curse says very interesting times considering in neither province have the feds come anywhere close to meeting the constitutional obligation to treat with indigenous nations a nut his predecessor failed to crack despite bending every rule and gaming every system in trying Last I checked the former ReformaCRAPaCon party have outstanding issues with West Coasters First Nations Quebec and New Brunswick proposed Atlantic terminus of the NEP 20 dilbit pipeline having labeled them respectively enviroterrorists vetodrunk Aboriginals treasonous Separatists and regionally attitudinal defeatists The NEP 20 corridor better be piping some honey for Andrews sake Plan Bee But an election campaign is either a great time to rhetorically reconcile these differences or varnish them over with slogans and paeans the former offering the slight chance of achieving something laudable sometime many mandates of compromise and cooperation in the future from now maybethe latter guaranteed to antagonize and deprive the very regions and factions of political support requisite for the CPC to win government Andrews dimples will be working overtime to get astride both of these narrative streams kinda like sore cheeks from laughing at hallucinations during a beersoaked acid trip at once profound inexplicable and hilarious Like Xavier Trudeau PS not wanting to risk falling into one of the ubiquitous narrativetraps mined around the bitumen issue I should like to add that the bitumen industrys future is uncertain only insofar as its end use is combustion into the atmosphere If it were up to me scientists and engineers would be working like the devil right now to develop nonfuel uses for Albertas gigantic resource of petrochemicals which is

been difficult to write considering all the circumstances and I have nothing to add  you covered it all and very well I listened on radio and occasionally watched on TV in passing the debate as chores took me around the house I cannot continually watch peoples faces perjuring themselves in public  I feel embarrassed both for them and my own sensibilities Nixon started it for me Hadnt tuned in to a debate for ages but this is an important time to keep tabs on whats going on The format was awful and the moderation only one step above utterly useless as expected The very first question was disregarded by Scheer who went off onto an antiTrudeau tirade instead and wasnt brought up short for it by the first moderator In fact I suppose one has to be a Con not to observe that their policies are almost nonexistent beyond typical boilerplate ideology Cut taxes bring in austerity and halleluyah were all happy shiny people who read the Bible and obey orders from our corporate betters while consuming at nonsustainable rates Scheer calls it a real plan  real dopey I used to hear more clearly thoughtout stuff than that at Model Parliaments almost 60 years at high school and then university And a not very bright man like Scheer working himself up into a minor rage on others positions as interpreted by him while spouting stupid lacklustre policy himself is a giant turnoff for me Meanwhile your local friendly completely smarmy and glib in it only for himself entirely unempathetic psychopath Kenney is roaming around Ontario propounding nonsense on the Alberta taxpayer dime Yes Ive read up on sociopaths and psychopaths and it is one of the latter the Alberta premier that is It roamed around Alberta organizing the UCP on the Federal government dime because it didnt resign its seat while doing so So the pattern was set A complete shite One supposes its Gallic xenophobic logic that allows Blanchet to happily accept that 70 of Quebecers are racist and happy to cut the civilhuman rights of people to wear religious symbolclothing at work in public service while being progressive on the environment Of course a lot of the latter is on the back of Newfoundland and Labradors Churchill Falls hydro at a penny a kWh Quebec at its illogical best I suppose Quietly making the place unliveable for anybody but the nativeborn in a closeted society Afeared of having their culture subsumed It never seems to occur to Quebec politicians to lead and change the social discourse  theyre happy with the peoples bigotries Trudeau awarded himself the title of being Chief Environmentalist of Canada but hes been unable to grasp reality in much the same way Notley cannot The same tired argument about flogging dilbit to get rich and then well be able to rilly rilly tackle environmental issues A true pol Full of nonsense and so full of himself he cannot understand that hes done anything wrong not met promises or that his logic is suspect Its all tralala in Liberal land I live in former NDP MP Stoffers riding found him good on point for veterans in a manner as Dutch and Northern French people liberated by us in WW2 would praise and voted for him every time on the trot Too bad he was dumped by the Red Wave for a nonentity whose main talent is collecting pay and standing up and sitting down on cue from the Liberal whip all the while collecting valuable pension points But then we found out Stoffer was a boozy misogynist despite being most popular MP etc Oh well more trust dashed on the shores of reality Following Notley going off the deep end and ruining the NDP I then transferred allegiance to the Greens and my local candidate is a young aerospace engineer who has done well in provincial byeelection polling Well hell when an engineer and I is one can stand up for the environment and not be frowned upon as a radical well thats good enough for me May is May and I respect her Unwavering but hampered by lack of party funds to come up with an immaculate logical party platform on the trot singlehandedly she holds her own Got her dig in at JT and his illogic Perhaps I might observe that a lot of fundamentalists have offered themselves up as Green Party candidates without much of a clue about pragmatism Idealists without a general focus as to how real implementation of real environmental policy would work  and stumbling over minutiae before understanding general policy issues At least my candidate doesnt follow that individual often mythicallybased improbable and impractical outlook But the man who was a dignified unrattleable person was Jagmeet Singh I am impressed For me he easily outshone the rest of these people and that at a mere canter Too bad he hid his light under a bushel for several years Notley could take a tip or two from him but thinks far too much of herself to change Ill be following Singhs fortunes closely in future Bernier should be committed or sent back to high school for remedial instruction  we could call it community service A bewildered dolt who isnt bright enough to work out why hes bewildered So mixedup and outofit no wonder May objected to his mere presence when she herself had been frozen out of debates for years I still dont get why we were subjected to Berniers ravings this time Is he really a libertarian Not sure he even knows what such attitudes are or mean He doesnt like

leaders talking over each other I dunnois it because Im from BC that my own take was the opposite After all we here in the Panhandlestopper province have seen our own leaders debate start proceed and end with incessant unintelligible bickering many many times The sixway multiplemoderator format was different and interesting as far as these debates go I thought the number of laughs and moments of collegial camaraderie was remarkable they all happened during bumps in the complicated debating procedure Not only that I cant recall ever seeing so many leaders acknowledge in a semicongratulatory way other leaders platforms Some were charmingly backhanded Blanchet approved of JTs SNCLavelin move but allowed that he just did it the wrong way May prayed aloud to the PM that he win only a minority and everybody paid homage to Jagmeet Singhs firsthand personallytargeted experience with racism Thus the hypocrisy of the two rightwing parties whose leaders associate with rampant antiimmigrant bigots was illustratively exposed Scheers acknowledgement to Singh was as long as a penitential confession after which he may sin again Berniers very presence inspired Singhs only bitter remarkthat the xenophobe shouldnt even be on the stage The best line was Singhs quip after a few of the moderators confused his and Scheers names I wore an orange turban special for tonightwhat does it take to look different than Scheer I laughed anyway I really dont want the ScheerCons to become government so was glad Berniers performance was fairly solid and should attract some of the bigots in the Con party who probably voted for him to be leader Rightwing voters are more likely tacticalvotings strategic target not practitioners themselves so it could be some of them dont really get votesplitting and will split the neoright by voting their first preference as a result The more Bernier erodes ScheerCon support the more I like it Scheers opening odium might have been staged for subsequent campaign propaganda but it sank him for the rest of the debate so meanspirited and predictableexactly what his base wantsthe one Scheer has to protect from Berniers pilfering I remain convinced most Canadians will be turned off by Scheers ostentatious hypocritical negativity and ad hominem against JT He could do worse and whip out a niqab to blunt Berniers simpler antiimmigrant rhetoric Here on the Big Island we know all about votesplitting here its the Conservatives who benefit by votesplitting between Greens and Dippers The big difference between GreenDipper splits and ScheerConPeoples Party splits is that we have a lot more experience out here In the last federal and provincial elections Green votecounts were conspicuously lower than the party had polled prior to either election meaning many Greens do understand how votesplitting works and are willing to vote tactically for the NDP to prevent the most environmentally unfriendly party from winning candidates or government It was educative to watch Elizabeth May break a cardinal rule as she continues to pull out all the stops in her final doordie election once again she deigned to presume a minority government and a supremely influential balanceofpower position for her party and hers alone But thats a nono which nevertheless she seems to have calculated to be an acceptable risk in the desperate circumstancethe risk of eroding Green volunteers morale of inciting complacency or riling resentments from soft supporters the foolhardiness perfectly matching another equally risky presumption that shell be okay working with a ScheerCon minority perhaps she regrets making that statement early onshe seemed to prefer a Liberal minority during the debateshe poignantly told Scheer he will never be Prime minister again risking volunteer and supporter loyalty by uttering such baseless prognostications Memo to Ms May voters will decide what the result will be and its always bad form for a leader to insinuate a coalition or speculate on a balanceofpower situation before voters have spoken As a Big Island Dipper I take exception to Mays misleading rhetoric that its time for all Greenminded voters to vote their preference without fearthe kind of fear that proreppers like her characterize FPtP tacticalvoting as being systemically forced upon the electorate an evil and undemocratic vote against rather than for a party or candidate Memo to voters in almost all ridings a Green vote will not elect a Green candidate and in many ridings especially on Van Isle and the West Coast Mainland where Liberals dont much figure a Green vote will ensure the Conservative candidate wins In the latter case Greens would further their professed environmental ethos by voting tactically for the candidate most likely to beat the Con candidate Thats especially true on the Big Island where Greens have been emboldened by relatively high polling numbersthe highest in Canadayet not high enough in most of these ridings to elect a Green unless every single traditional NDP voter switches parties Considering the NDP holds second or first place in most Van Isle ridings that kind of conversion seems most unlikely May has toned down her more overt electoralreform sourgrapes rhetoric but keeps alluding to it by telling voters to ignore the fact that we still have FPtP and ignore the fact that tacticalvoting is therefore a legitimate consideration for every voter to make not the devil incarnate that proreppers campaign on during electoral reform debates and referenda All in all I found the debate informative and probably helpful it will probably increase votesplitting between Scheers and Berniers parties in favour of neither and decrease votesplitting between Greens and Dippers which would otherwise only favour the ScheerCons Well done PS my kid brother and I agreed by text that if we had our druthers after watching the debate wed both vote for Althea Raj He said he was glad when it was over But hes a BuckaBeer guyperhaps now regretfully soand I naturally have more to say about almost anything political Ms Raj is of course the Huff Posts political analyst,0.13374,0.27959386

worried predictions of the Dippers demise might not have been exaggerated it seemed plain the Liberals would hang on to power from the very first Atlantic returns but the NDPafter being all but shut out of ridings east of the Capital mostly by the resurgent Bloc Qubcois and remaining in the single digits for most of the eveningbegan to pick up seats west of the Rockies including Big Island seats the Greens were predicted to win Texting and phoning back and forth between here and Vancouver where my significant other does grandmother duty and votedin Jodys riding was exciting enough first when we realized the Dippers were going to hold the balance of power next as the GreenCon threats to NDP incumbent seats on the Big Island fell one by one and finally to the supreme relief that the competitive Conservative didnt slip up the split in Jodys ridingshe took it herself the only Independent elected to the HoC What a night But if I have to endure too much prorep babble my heads gonna explode Next the obligatory speeches form leaders before capping the night with emails texts and messages to relieved NDP MPs on the Big Islandand to my Green compatriots who voted with their heads not their hearts to help us thrash the ScheerCon Candidates we were afraid would win if the vote was split The speeches seemed arranged to happen at nearly the same time modern technology really helped I was too tired to appreciate much of a Schadenfreude moment for Green leader May whod predicted her party would take every single riding on the Big Island only the day before she kept her own seat with a reduced but very convincing percentage of the riding vote and the other Green incumbent who only won his seat in a byelection last spring hung on to a shrinking lead for the win only to end up winning exactly the same two Green seats But I was happy at least one more Green was elected in New Brunswick another place where the movement made its debut provincially before a hesitant foray into federal politics Trudeaus speech was sickly sweet and predictable Only heard that Bernier got thrashed thank goodnessbut didnt bother with the concession speech Blanchet was risible as far as my fading french could discern I heard Jody say WoWover the phone from my sweeties TVthats all Naturally I was happy to listen to Jagmeet who didnt disappoint and maintained his respect and optimism despite his likely elevation to the secondmost important politician in the larger half of North America I havent felt this proud since Mulcair went into the last campaign as leader of the most popular party in Canadaanother first for the NDP after Layton won the Loyal Opposition before dying of cancer almost immediately after that astounding win But it was Scheers speech I really wanted to hear After predicting hed be toast if he didnt win at least a minority I realized I hadnt figured his CPC would win the socalled popular vote I thought it would therefore be an occasion to confidently concede with grace the consolation probably being the next best thingan improvement over last time and a proverbial silver lining I was surprised to hear his unconcealed bitternessto be expected I supposeunderpin an angry defiant threateningeven vengeful tone No congratulation to the winner but rather a prediction when not if the Liberal government falls  Conservatives will be ready And then to return to the conservative principles Canada was supposedly built upon He went on to remind the two sparecloth prairie provinces that JT is out to destroy them and their industry and that he could not represent them Nice Andrew really nice Was he defending himself against the speculated leadership challenge by returning to the well of hatred his colleague Jason KeKangaroo Kenney has dug in the province he is nowfor a time anywaypremier of Scheer seemed to be talking only to his baseobvious to any Canadian outside of it One look at the map made me shake my head at such a spiteful concession speech from the man who would be prime minister of the entire country Apparently he thinks winning the popular vote entitles him to keep the gin flowing to his snarling base it was on hand anyhow for the hopedfor win even though not really a majority achievement But the map says a lot the coasts are red in the East where Saudi oil comes in and orange in the West where dilbit leaks out and with the Blocs light blue covering that distinct shape of Quebec and the ScheerCons dark blue concentrated in small agricultural regions of Annapolis St Lawrence southern Ontario Okanagan and Lower Mainland BC then all of Saskatchewan and nearly all Albertathe country looks partitioned very neatly Thats somehow worrisome What bugs me is that a palpable atmosphere of anger has developed across these partitions Atlantic Canada for its chronic economic stagnation Quebec for its nationalist frustration Ontario for its DohFo and the Wet Coat because of pipeline proposalsand therefore that Scheer appeared ready to cultivate that when he should have been showing his five kids what good sportsmanship isespecially by a leader who would be prime minister of this diverse nation Havent

GHG terms theres no contest because Big B must burn petrofuels to smelt bitumen from the sandy matrix in which it is found the upfront GHG is necessarily higher than sweet crude which flows itself out of the Arabian sands in pure form ready to ship anywhere as is its subsequent refining is also much less expensive than dilbit which is the lowest grade of petroleum next to asphalt Its one thing to garner unquestioned loyalty from bitumen workers in Alberta quite another to garner electoral support on these grounds from the ROCQ this is the elections grim test result suspicion now confirmed Not sure if Scheers presumption that the electorate would side with the bitumen provinces was purely foolish Although polls consistently showed the CPC as submajority and only on the cusp of minority potential it was a shot he would have been irresponsible as party leader not to take and JT was really the only chink in which he could bend his pry barthe Quebec separatist threat so successfully leveraged by the original destroyers of the Progressive Conservative hegemony not yet so apparent during CPCs 2019 campaign planning also not sure how the myseparatismsbetterthanyourseparatism will play for future conservative leadersalready conservative premiers from the formercolonial provinces are distancing themselves from this kind of contest Given theres virtual CPC seatcount parity between the two formercharter sparecloth provinces and the old province of Canada Upper and Lower 47 to 46 respectively its still possible for the next CPC leader to extricate the party from UCPSP nationalunitycrisis rhetoric Jason KeKangaroo Kenney might have something to say about that though those two provinces being essential for any federal return he might be contemplating With pseudoCondom in general retreat all over the Western World and the likelihood that our current minority government will probably perform better in Canadians estimation courtesy of NDP tempering the KeKangaroo whos no dummy as DJC correctly noteswill need to temper his own separatist takemybitumenbatandballandgohome rhetoric among other important and essential steps in preparation for the jump before entertaining any federal revival of this currently moribund movement But its true Kenney left Scheer no option but to adopt what astute pundits recognized as a losing campaign strategy In fact many an astute pundit has speculated that given the impossible numbers it was always the KeKangaroos plan to let Scheer fail sos to run for CPC leadership himself thence for Prime Ministership Naturally the required disingenuousness and narratological contortions will be fascinating to behold I have my doubts anything will work though at least not for many years after the DohFo has been unelected in voterich Ontario KeKenney will have to come out of the closet to stump his rump in the Upper Canadian farm belt Will he apply his bitumen rhetoric to Petrolia where the jerkline shackles and crimps are still wrought by hand still the commercial source of some of the sweetest crude in the world it is however at the opposite end of production aspiration as bitumen mining is I suspect KeKenney would pretend it doesnt exist at all I think even TMXapproving Canadians will in the unfolding circumstances be copacetic with the twinned pipeline simply replacing what the existing TM line doesJT has plenty of reasons to sandbag I was almost gonna make a punbut no this obvious out being one at least the nowpublic enterprise continues to generate revenues without having to increase supertanker dilbit shipping seven fold as the UCP and CPC say they must happen or else I still cant help but notice the many superior features of a Prince Rupert dilbit export terminusthere are so many that I almost missed the fact that such a route would pass through and benefit BCs little piece of the Great Plains which currently adopts Albertas separatist sabre rattling as if fully irredentist a fact not missed by provincial and federal politicians whod like to relive the CPC and the BC Liberals provincially of these seats by way of nonCon government largess A pipeline would blunt rising discontent from this remote corner of BC which until the LNG pipeline and terminus in Kitimat the destination of Harpers shitcanned Northern Gateway Pipeline is completed is beholden to the sole market of the bitumen mines to which it supplies gas for smelting operationsat discounted prices no doubt Having a hard time with the Three Stooges comparison KeKenney acts more like Moe Howard to me than Scott Moe does the Dohfo though does an excellent Curly leaving Scott Moe the role of Larry that Stooge of perennial peevishness It really is interesting that Alison Redford has unleashed a trial skunk upon the picnic of prairie pugnacity A conservative Notley perhaps Nobody ever said she wasnt smartas diplomat that is not so much as a politician But it doesnt take too much smarts to sniff around the prospect of the premiership soon being abandoned to another leadership race this time for the UCP at least at the corners,0.108421,0.23897682
