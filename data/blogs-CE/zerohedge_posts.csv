44,zerohedge,"China Accuses ""Canadian Elites"" Of ""White Supremacy"" Over Prosecution Of Huawei CFO",2019-01-10 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Justin Trudeau has already been accused of being a misogynist. Now his entire government is being accused of White Supremacy by the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa over its insistence that China release two Canadians - including a former diplomat who were detained by Chinese authorities last month, despite China's insistence that both men ""without a doubt"" posed a threat to Chinese national security.



In the op-ed, published by Ottawa's the Hill Times newspaper, ambassador Lu Shaye lashed out at Canadian ""elites [who] completely dismissed China’s law and presumptuously urged China to immediately release their citizens."" He also accused Canada of enforcing a double standard by detaining Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou despite her not having committed a violation of Canadian law. Canadians have shown intense concern over the wellbeing of their citizens, but Lu accused them of behaving thoughtlessly and cruelly toward Meng.


However, on the prior groundless detention of Chinese citizen Meng Wanzhou by Canada at the behest of the United States, these same people made utterly different comments. They insisted that Canada’s detention of a Chinese citizen who was transferring planes at the airport was ""acting in accordance with law,"" though Meng has not been charged with any violation of Canadian law.

It’s understandable that these Canadians are concerned about their own citizens. But have they shown any concern or sympathy for Meng after she was illegally detained and deprived of freedom?

Without violating any Canadian law, Meng was arrested last month and put in handcuffs just as she was changing planes at the Vancouver International Airport.It seems that, to some people, only Canadian citizens shall be treated in a humanitarian manner and their freedom deemed valuable, while Chinese people do not deserve that.

Lu pointed out the hypocrisy in Canadian officials' insistence that Meng's detention was just because Canada is a country that respects the ""rule of law,"" implying that China isn't.


When China called on the Canadian side to release Meng and ensure her legal and legitimate rights and interests, those elites claimed in the media that Canada is a country of rule of law and has an independent judiciary, and therefore it must comply with the judicial proceeding. However, in the case of detention of Canadian citizens in China who violated China’s law, those elites completely dismissed China’s law and presumptuously urged China to immediately release their citizens. It seems that, to those people, the laws of Canada or other Western countries are laws and must be observed, while China’s laws are not and shouldn’t be respected.

In a repudiation of the US's accusations that Huawei has helped the Chinese government spy on western rivals, Lu pointed out that while Canada has objected to Huawei, it hasn't shown a similar level of concern about cyberespionage efforts carried out by the US - including those that were exposed in the sensitive NSA documents stolen by former contractor Edward Snowden.


Some people in Canada, without any evidence, have been hyping the idea that Huawei is controlled by the Chinese government and poses security threats to Canada and other Western countries, and that Chinese law requires China’s enterprises to collaborate with the government in espionage activities. However, these same people have conveniently ignored the PRISM Program, Equation Group, and Echelon—global spying networks operated by some countries that have been engaging in large-scale and organized cyber stealing, and spying and surveillance activities on foreign governments, enterprises, and individuals. These people also took a laissez-faire attitude toward a country that infringes on its citizens’ privacy rights through the Patriot Act. They shouted for a ban by the Five Eyes alliance countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) on the use of Huawei equipment by these countries’ own enterprises, which is literally a government-controlled action.

When Canada creates its national security laws, Lu says, it seems espionage carried out by western governments is deemed essential to national security, while China's espionage efforts are branded a threat.

When making laws for national security and intelligence, China has drawn references from the relevant laws of the U.S., Canada, and other Western countries. Something is considered as ""safeguarding national security"" when it is done by Western countries. But it is termed ""conducting espionage"" when done by China. What’s the logic?

Though Canada considers itself a bastion of liberal values, Lu claimed that double standards like this one stem from the same western ""white supremacy"" that has made ""the rule of law"" nothing more than a tool for political ends - despite the seemingly endless stream of virtue-signaling.


The reason why some people are used to arrogantly adopting double standards is due to Western egotism and white supremacy. In such a context, the rule of law is nothing but a tool for their political ends and a fig leaf for their practising hegemony in the international arena. What they have been doing is not showing respect for the rule of law, but mocking and trampling the rule of law.

Meanwhile, China has clearly indicated that it intends to prosecute Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor for threatening national security - though they've offered the caveat that both cases are still ""under investigation"", leaving an opening to release the two men, presumably if Canada decides to drop its prosecution of Meng. Both men have been denied access to legal representation","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>Justin Trudeau has already been accused of being a misogynist.

With most of the ten provinces struggling to receive even a fraction of pot that suppliers have promised, a shortage has left the industry in shock, and caused concerns that Canadian cannabis producers were not well structured to handle the large demand from the Canadian marketplace.



Government officials have recently stepped in, Quebec’s government-controlled stores are now closed three days a week, Alberta has temporarily halted issuing new retail licenses and Ontario has said it will open only 25 stores.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

As of mid-December, about 50% of products for sale in five provinces were out of stock, according to Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer.

The shortage could get much worse and continue for as long as three years, warned Chuck Rifici, chief executive officer of Toronto-based Auxly Cannabis Group Inc.


“There’s a lot of execution risk, people are expanding by 10, 20 times,” Rifici said in an interview at an AltaCorp Capital conference in Toronto Tuesday. “Personally, I think we’re at least three years out from hitting real equilibrium.”

""While smaller producers will face hurdles including access to capital and expertise, even the larger companies are likely to face delays as they open new facilities and refine their production methods,"" Rifici said, adding that “ultimately any manufacturing facility growing 20 times is likely to face delays.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });



Greg Engel, CEO of Organigram Holdings Inc., believes it would be “a couple years” before the supply shortages are solved.

Everett Knight, executive vice president for strategy and investments at Valens Groworks Corp., also said it will take two to three years.

“It’s harder to grow cannabis than most people think,” Knight said, adding that producers tend to underestimate how many plants they’ll lose to problems like mold.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose party campaigned on legalizing weed, said last month he expects the shortage to clear up in the second half of 2019.

According to Global News, Trudeau briefed reporters in an end-of-year interview, predicting that shortages would sort themselves out “during the coming months and perhaps the coming year,"" adding that the supply issues were mostly centralized in Eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec)

The shortage is one of the factors weighing on cannabis stocks, which have tumbled in the last several months. The Nasdaq Yewno North America Cannabis Economy Index crashed more than 40% since mid-September 2018. Investors have been concerned of the inability to meet demand will weigh on producers’ earnings.



At the same time, cannabis producers are adding millions of square feet in production facilities over the coming quarters in hopes to address the shortages. However, most of these facilities might not be operational until the second half of 2019 or 2020","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p><strong>Canada’s massive&nbsp;marijuana shortage could last for many years, according to industry executives who <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-08/pot-shortage-in-canada-could-last-up-to-3-years-executives-say"">warn</a> there is not enough pot for the growing demand.</strong></p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,&nbsp;whose party campaigned on&nbsp;legalizing weed, said last month he&nbsp;expects the shortage to clear up in the second half of 2019.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em><a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/4765051/justin-trudeau-cannabis-supply-shortage/"">Global News</a>,&nbsp;</em>Trudeau briefed reporters&nbsp;in an end-of-year interview,&nbsp;predicting that shortages would sort themselves out “<em>during the coming months and perhaps the coming year,"" adding that the supply issues were mostly centralized&nbsp;</em>in Eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec)</p>

<p><strong>The shortage is one of the factors weighing on cannabis stocks, which have tumbled in the last several months.</strong> The&nbsp;Nasdaq Yewno North America Cannabis Economy Index crashed more than 40% since mid-September 2018. Investors have been concerned of the&nbsp;inability to meet demand will weigh on producers’ earnings.</p>

42,zerohedge,China Says Detained Former Canadian Diplomat Doesn't Have Diplomatic Immunity,2019-01-14 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Responding to comments from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who over the weekend accused China of violating the diplomatic immunity of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig (one of two Canadian nationals who were arrested in China on vague ""national security"" related crimes, seemingly in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou), China affirmed on Monday that Kovrig, who worked as a diplomat for Canada for years stationed all over Asia, didn't benefit from diplomatic immunity.



Spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry Hua Chunying

Trudeau said it was ""unfortunate"" that China had arbitrarily detained Canadian citizens and ""indeed in one case is not respecting diplomatic immunity."" It was, according to the South China Morning Post, Trudeau's first public comment on the detentions. Canadian officials had previously said Kovrig was on unpaid leave from his job with the Canadian government.

""This is something that we are engaged right now both with Chinese officials and with our partners around the world where there is a concern for the need for all countries to do like Canada and to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial processes.""

Trudeau later added that China was operating under the ""rule of law.""

Trudeau, speaking Friday during a press conference in Regina, said that Canada was operating under the “rule of law’’ in the Meng case, including granting her bail to allow her to be in her own home in Vancouver. He encouraged China to do the same.


""This is the way we live up to our rules within our justice system,"" Trudeau said.

""It is unfortunate that China has arbitrarily and unfairly detained two Canadian citizens, and indeed in one of the cases is not respecting diplomatic immunity,"" he continued.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });

But China, which has accused Canada of ignoring the rule of law with its arrest of Meng, rejected these claims, citing Kovrig's entrance to China on a business visa.

A Chinese foreign ministry officials suggested that Trudeau study the Vienna Convention to avoid making ridiculous claims about to whom it applies, per Reuters.

According to the South China Morning Post, a notice by the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Chinese citizens to be aware of the risks of being ""arbitrarily detained at the request of a third nation"" in Canada, and urged caution when making travel plans - an obvious reference to the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Vancouver last month at the behest of the US.



In addition to the death sentence handed down to Schellenberg, a ruling that many accused of being politically influenced due to the suspiciously swift appeal and hearing, China has arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on vague ""National Security"" charges.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after the death sentence was handed down that Canada was prepared to intervene on Schellenberg's behalf.


""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply [the] death penalty...as in this case facing a Canadian,"" Trudeau said.

The Chinese government and the local court where Schellenberg's re-sentencing took place defended the verdict, saying the rule of law had been followed.


The local court in Dalian, Liaoning Province, which delivered the verdict, said on Tuesday that it had ""rigorously enforced"" the relevant laws in Schellenberg’s case ""without any procedural violations.""

It said the Liaoning Higher Court had ordered a retrial after Schellenberg appealed against his initial 15-year sentence, adding that it “followed the law in accepting the case” and had carried out the necessary processes.

Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, also insisted that the rule of law had been followed in Schellenberg’s case.

""The Canadian government should remind its citizens not about facing threats in China, but to never come to China to commit serious offences such as smuggling or trafficking drugs,"" she said in a daily briefing.

""Those who commit these serious offences in China will definitely face serious consequences.""

But observers said the case bore all of the hallmarks of a politically sensitive issue.


Scott McKnight, managing editor of the China Open Research Network at the University of Toronto, said the sudden change and increased coverage in Chinese media was a “clear indication to us that the Chinese government is eager to politicise this specific case in its broader diplomatic spat with Canada.""

""The Chinese government, in choosing to escalate this stand-off, is showing that it’s immune – or simply doesn’t care – about the damage it is doing to its reputation, so long as it somehow helps to get Mrs Meng back to China,"" he said.

<p>Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after the death sentence was handed down that Canada was prepared to intervene on Schellenberg's behalf.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply [the] death penalty...as in this case facing a Canadian,""</strong> Trudeau said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Chinese government and the local court where Schellenberg's re-sentencing took place defended the verdict, saying the rule of law had been followed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The local court in Dalian, Liaoning Province, which delivered the verdict, said on Tuesday that it had ""rigorously enforced"" the relevant laws in Schellenberg’s case ""without any procedural violations.""</p>

<p>It said the Liaoning Higher Court had ordered a retrial after Schellenberg appealed against his initial 15-year sentence, adding that it “followed the law in accepting the case” and had carried out the necessary processes.</p>

<p>Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, also insisted that the rule of law had been followed in Schellenberg’s case.</p>

<p><strong>""The Canadian government should remind its citizens not about facing threats in China, but to never come to China to commit serious offences such as smuggling or trafficking drugs,""</strong> she said in a daily briefing.</p>

<p><strong>""Those who commit these serious offences in China will definitely face serious consequences.""</strong></p>

21,zerohedge,Canada's Forgotten Man: Energy Workers,2019-01-16 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Andrew Moran via Liberty Nation,

Canada’s energy sector is home to the nation’s forgotten man...



All over the world, the forgotten man is rising up, reminding the ruling elite of his existence. Fed up with leaders catering to the whims of 0.05% of society, or instituting policies that impact their pocketbooks, the working folks of America, Italy, Brazil, and France are making sure their voices are heard in the political arena. This uncomfortable fact is sending shivers up and down their masters’ spines, including those in the Great White North.

Ivory Tower

For so long, Canadians were passive and apathetic about how they were treated by their rulers. They just drowned their sorrows of excessive taxation and abuse of the public purse in a Tim Hortons double-double and a plate of poutine. That’s just the way it is, they cried. There’s nothing to do, they grieved.

But then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau happened.

The trust fund baby is a man who continually talks down to those who are not like him. By encouraging young people to use “peoplekind,” openly wishing that Ottawa would embrace a Chinese-style government, andsuggesting citizens with real concerns about Syrian migrants are racist, Trudeau has begun to light the populist spark from British Columbia to Newfoundland.

To truly comprehend the left’s disdain for blue-collar Canadians who do not accept the premises of leftist dogma, you will need to travel to Calgary, Alberta. At a recent demonstration of energy workers, Liberal Mayor Naheed Nenshi treated the crowd like kindergarteners:

“Well, for those of you who are saying, ‘No I don’t believe in climate change,’ good luck changing hearts and minds because we have to be able to say that there is no difference between standing up for the economy and standing up for the environment.”

Nenshi shifted his remarks into French, but he received pushback from the crowd. This led the condescending mayor to threaten the crowd with detention: “If you want someone to listen to you, you have to speak their language.”

It is this mockery, condescension, and dismissal that is producing discontent nationwide, particularly in the energy sector. In the era of Trudeaumania 2.0, politicians from major urban centers turn their noses up at workers employed in the oil, gas, and coal industries. Journalists, accepting a $600 million bribe from the federal government, refrain from calling out such deplorable behavior. Instead, they report favorably on imposing carbon taxes, delaying pipelines, and implementing egregious environmental regulations in the resource-rich country.

Of course, the energy sector’s tax dollars are good enough to be used against them, extending generous grants and subsidies to the politically-connected green industry. Why? To appease the globalists who are using the religion of global warming to control populations.

But Canadians are no longer sitting idly by. They’re mad as hell and are sending clear signals that they’re not going to take it anymore.

Polite No More

In December, a convoy of trucks in Grand Prairie, Alberta “touched its tail” as it rallied in the city impacted by several government policies, including the carbon tax, Bill C-48, and Bill C-69. While the carbon tax is terrifying for all Canadians, C-48 and C-69 mainly target energy; the former prohibits oil tanker traffic on British Columbia’s northern coast and the latter dramatically transforms the process of environmental assessments for every major infrastructure project, including the ever-important trans-province energy project proposals.

The protests against the levy and Bills C-48 and C-69 are only intensifying. Another Alberta-based convoy of trucks is taking its frustrations to Ottawa next month.

“We want to make our voices heard,” James Robson, the grassroots Canada Action manager, told The Star.“Families are supported by the energy sector. It’s one of the most important economic drivers in Canada.”

The Trudeau government seems indifferent to the growing opposition to carbon taxes and punishing legislative blitzkrieg. This should not come as a surprise. Energy Minister Catherine McKenna, also known as Climate Barbie, encouraged a grain farmer to just adopt artificial intelligence to combat the costs of the carbon tax.

It is this level of arrogance that puts Trudeau and his minions out of touch with typical Canadians.

The Forgotten Man’s Resurgence

Is Canada igniting another Tea Party, Arab Spring, or Yellow Vest movement?

Perhaps the modesty of your average Canadian will never concede to something so iconic, instead preferring to just have their voices heard by the central planners who think they’re better than someone from rural Alberta or the Maritimes. Canada’s thought police and gatekeepers of permissible opinion are warning about the dangers of populism, but if they wish to quash its inevitable ascent to mainstream politics, they should quit treating voters not from Toronto, Vancouver, or Ottawa either like they don’t exist or as if they’re children riding the short bus","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p><a href=""https://www.libertynation.com/canadas-forgotten-man-energy-workers/""><em>Authored by Andrew Moran via Liberty Nation,</em></a></p>

40,zerohedge,The Yellow Vest Movement Has Gone Global,2019-01-20 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"The Yellow Vest anti-government movement started in France on November 17, when over 300,000 people across France protested a carbon tax on fuel that French President Emmanuel Macron touted as evidence of France's leadership when it comes to mitigating climate change.

The Yellow Vest protests quickly evolved into a general anti-government movement - with hundreds of thousands of angry French citizens taking to the streets for ten straight weeks of mostly peaceful protests marked with pockets of violence, looting and mayhem.

What's more - the movement has gone worldwide - with perhaps the most notable protests outside France taking place in Belgium, where Brussels riot cops have dealt with week after week of protesters blocking oil depot and throwing hard objects at them.

On December 8, Belgians attempted to breach a riot barricade while calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Charles Michel, resulting in around 100 arrests.

And while most of the protests outside of France happened last month, this is a good list to note where discontent is mounting.
Bulgaria: Yellow Vests began protesting the same weekend as the French movement - coming out in force on November 16 to protest in front of parliament and demand the resignation of the government.
Canada: Yellow Vest protests have taken place in more than a dozen cities across Canada - largely campaigning against the carbon price, Canada's participation in the UN's Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, the Trudeau administration and other issues.
Croatia: Croatians came out in force on December 15, gathering in Ban Jelacic Square.

Egypt: An Egyptian A lawyer was arrested and jailed for 15 days after he posted a picture of himself wearing a Yellow Vest in support of the French protests.
Finland: Finns came out in force in mid-December as well, gathering in front of Parliament in opposition to the UN's Global Migration pact.

39,zerohedge,40% Of Canadians Pay Zero Income Tax,2019-02-13 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Alex Kimani via Safehaven.com,

Here's an unexpected factoid: the commonly held belief that the average Canadian pays more taxes than the average American is an old wives’ tale.



A 2018 study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that the average single Canadian with no kids paid 22.8 percent of their income as taxes in 2017, ranking as the 11th lowest among the OECD’s 35 countries. It also compares to 26.1 percent by the average American.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

But that’s not all. The difference is a lot more extreme for households with children, with the average married Canadian worker with two children only paying 1.2 percent, good for the 32nd lowest amongst OECD nations and nearly 12x lower than the 14.2 percent that a similar demographic in the U.S. doles out to Uncle Sam.

40 Percent of Canadians pay zero income tax…

Naturally, you would expect that Canada’s generous tax system is due to an incredibly efficient and “fair” tax system whereby nearly everybody pays their dues. Well, spoiler alert: only 60 percent of Canadians pay an effective tax to the government.

Indeed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was right when he made the bold declaration that:

“…low-income families don’t benefit from tax breaks because they don’t pay taxes.”

On average, 40 percent of Canadian households end up paying zilch towards federally and provincially funded expenses including education, healthcare, social services, public safety, national defense and even the good old Canada Revenue Agency. On the other hand, 20 percent of households end up stomaching more than 70 percent of those costs. It’s a startling fact that even Trudeau probably would not want many Canadians to know.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-2'); });

The Canadian tax system certainly appears lopsided. But how exactly does 40 percent of the population end up paying zero taxes? To answer that question, the Fraser Institute’s Canadian Tax Simulator 2017 looked at the bottom 40 percent of Canadian households by income. They found that the 40 percent of households fell in the $0-80,843 income bracket and paid 4.6 percent of the country’s total personal tax. That might look like a really low number. Surprisingly, it still gets even lower because federal and provincial give back all of the tax…and then some.

The CRA online tax calculator can help you get a grip of how so many households wind up with a zero percent tax bill. To better drive home this point, let’s run three different scenarios reflecting different income levels through the calculator.


Scenario #1 - this hypothetical household has three children aged 1,4 and 6 years and two parents with each parent making $22,650 for a total household income of $45,300. Using the Ernst & Young personal tax calculator, this household should pay a total of $4,564 in federal and provincial income tax, which falls to the 20th percentile mark as per the Fraser Institute or smack in the middle of the bottom 40 percent in income bracket. In reality, though, this group receives tax-free benefits of $19,321.96 and ends up with net receipts of $14,758 --from other taxpayers.

Scenario #2 - this demographic is similar to the first but with a household income of $60,420, or the 30th percentile. Assuming no deductions, this household should pay $7,596 in income taxes according to the Ernst & Young calculator but instead receives $13,738.32 in tax-free benefits and ends up with net receipts of a cool $6,142—again from other taxpayers.

Scenario #3 - this household is similar to the first two but with a household income of $80,844, which falls in the 40th percentile. Again assuming no deductions, this household should pay income tax of $11,690. In reality, it only pays $1,408 after receiving $10,282.44 in tax-free benefits.

Whether or not Canada’s represents a fair tax system is a subjective issue depending on where you fall in the tax regime. That said, it’s worth noting thatmiddle-class Canadians probably pay more taxes than middle-class Americans. Some rich Americans, however, pay more than rich Canadians considering that the top marginal tax rate on personal income in the U.S. is 47.9 percent vs. 45.7 percent in Canada.

On average, Canadians don’t necessarily pay more income tax than Americans. They, however, do get a lot more from their government in terms of social services. America’s $3.4 trillion-a-year in universal healthcare might be unrivaled anywhere on the globe yet the country’s 78.8 years life expectancy only ranks 27th in the OECD, while its child mortality rate is the 4th highest. In contrast, life expectancy in Canada is significantly higher at 81.7 years despite the country’s $4,500 per capita healthcare spend vs. $9,000 in the US.

So what exactly do Americans get for their taxes? The world’s most powerful national defense.

<p>A 2018 study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that <strong>the average single Canadian with no kids paid 22.8 percent of their income as taxes in 2017,</strong> ranking as the 11th&nbsp;lowest among the OECD’s 35 countries. It also <strong>compares to 26.1 percent by the average American.</strong></p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""my_spring1"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""></aside></div><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""out-placement"" id=""article-outstream"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });</script></aside></div>

<p>But that’s not all. The difference is a lot more extreme for households with children, with the average married Canadian worker with two children only paying 1.2 percent, good for the 32nd&nbsp;lowest amongst OECD nations and nearly 12x lower than the 14.2 percent that a similar demographic in the U.S. doles out to Uncle Sam.</p>

<h3><u><strong>40 Percent of Canadians pay zero income tax…</strong></u></h3>

<p>Naturally, you would expect that Canada’s generous tax system is due to an incredibly efficient and “fair” tax system whereby nearly everybody pays their dues. Well, spoiler alert: <strong>only 60 percent of Canadians pay an effective tax to the government.</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was right when he&nbsp; made the bold declaration that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“…low-income families don’t benefit from tax breaks because they don’t pay taxes.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, 40 percent of Canadian households end up paying zilch towards federally and provincially funded expenses including education, healthcare, social services, public safety, national defense and even the good old Canada Revenue Agency. On the other hand, <strong>20 percent of households end up stomaching more than 70 percent of those costs.</strong> It’s a startling fact that even Trudeau probably would not want many Canadians to know.</p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""placement placement-embedded"" id=""in-content-2"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 250px; min-width: 300px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-2'); });</script></aside></div>

<p><strong>The Canadian tax system certainly appears lopsided. But how exactly does 40 percent of the population end up paying zero taxes?</strong> To answer that question, the Fraser Institute’s Canadian Tax Simulator 2017 looked at the bottom 40 percent of Canadian households by income. They found that the 40 percent of households fell in the $0-80,843 income bracket and paid 4.6 percent of the country’s total personal tax. That might look like a really low number. Surprisingly, it still gets even lower because federal and provincial give back all of the tax…and then some.</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong.

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html"">CRA online tax calculator</a>&nbsp;can help you get a grip of how so many households wind up with a zero percent tax bill. To better drive home this point, let’s run three different scenarios reflecting different income levels through the calculator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scenario #1</strong> - this hypothetical household has three children aged 1,4 and 6 years and two parents with each parent making $22,650 for a total household income of $45,300. Using the Ernst &amp; Young personal tax calculator, this household should pay a total of $4,564 in federal and provincial income tax, which falls to the 20th percentile mark as per the Fraser Institute or smack in the middle of the bottom 40 percent in income bracket. In reality, though, this group receives tax-free benefits of $19,321.96 and ends up with net receipts of $14,758 --from other taxpayers.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario #2</strong> - this demographic is similar to the first but with a household income of $60,420, or the 30th percentile. Assuming no deductions, this household should pay $7,596 in income taxes according to the Ernst &amp; Young calculator but instead receives $13,738.32 in tax-free benefits and ends up with net receipts of a cool $6,142—again from other taxpayers.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario #3 </strong>- this household is similar to the first two but with a household income of $80,844, which falls in the 40th percentile. Again assuming no deductions, this household should pay income tax of $11,690. In reality, it only pays $1,408 after receiving $10,282.44 in tax-free benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not Canada’s represents a fair tax system is a subjective issue depending on where you fall in the tax regime. That said, it’s worth noting that<strong> middle-class Canadians probably pay more taxes than middle-class Americans.</strong> Some rich Americans, however, pay more than rich Canadians considering that the top marginal tax rate on personal income in the U.S. is 47.9 percent vs. 45.7 percent in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>On average, Canadians don’t necessarily pay more income tax than Americans. They, however, do get a lot more from their government in terms of social services.</strong> America’s $3.4 trillion-a-year in universal healthcare might be unrivaled anywhere on the globe yet the country’s 78.8 years life expectancy only ranks 27th&nbsp;in the OECD, while its child mortality rate is the 4th&nbsp;highest. In contrast, life expectancy in Canada is significantly higher at 81.7 years despite the country’s $4,500 per capita healthcare spend vs. $9,000 in the US.</p>

<p>So what exactly do Americans get for their taxes? The world’s most powerful national defense. The country’s annual defense spending of $611 billion is more than China, Russia, U.K., France, Japan, Saudi Arabia and India combined.</p>

38,zerohedge,Justin Trudeau's Government In Turmoil After Top Aide Resigns Over Corruption Allegations,2019-02-18 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"When he swept into office back in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised supporters of a Liberal Party reinvigorated by a decade of conservative rule that he would bring about ""real change"" - both in Ottawa, and for a Liberal Party marred by allegations of corruption.

So far, he has largely failed at both, cozying up to the country's energy industry while masking his maintenance of the pro-business status quo with legalized marijuana and a ""progressive"" agenda that has included banning misgendering and hiring the first cabinet in Canada's history with an equal number of men and women.

Yet as Canada's leader braces for what promises to be a bruising reelection campaign ahead of a vote in October, his office has been marred by a blossoming scandal surrounding reports that it pressured the former attorney general into dropping years-old corruption charges against Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian construction company with close ties to Trudeau's party.





googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

In a sign that this scandal won't easily disappear, no matter how many times Trudeau stands in front of a gaggle of reporters and breezily denies the allegations, one of his closest aids resigned on Monday over allegations that he or his staff pressured the former AG, who was abruptly demoted last month.

The aide, Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, denied the allegations, and said he was resigning to avoid distracting Trudeau from the hard work ahead. It's unclear whether he will have any role on the Trudeau campaign. He is considered the second most influential official in Trudeau's government after Chief of Staff Katie Telford.


Principal Secretary Gerald Butts issued a statement Monday, during a long weekend in much of Canada, announcing his resignation in order to prevent the issue from distracting “from the vital work the Prime Minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

A report this month by the Globe and Mail newspaper raised allegationsthe prime minister’s office pressured Trudeau’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to settle fraud and corruption charges against construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. The controversy escalated last week after Wilson-Raybould, who had been moved into a new ministry recently, quit cabinet.

In his statement, Butts said he “categorically” denied the allegation that he or any of his staff pressured her.

""My reputation is my responsibility and that is for me to defend,"" Butts said in the statement. ""It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away.""

In his statement to the Globe and Mail, Butts said he and Trudeau's office ""honored the role"" of the attorney general.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });


“I categorically deny the accusation that I or anyone else in this office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould,” Mr. Butts said in a statement on Monday. “We honoured the unique role of the Attorney General. At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians.”

A Globe and Mail story on Feb. 7 said Ms. Wilson-Raybould came under pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to instruct prosecutors to offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution deal when she was justice minister and attorney-general.

Trudeau also tweeted the full statement:

Gerald Butts served this government - and our country - with integrity, sage advice and devotion. I want to thank him for his service and continued friendship. Please read his statement today: pic.twitter.com/VIaEHJMMe4

He also said his decision to resign shouldn't detract from Trudeau's work. Trudeau has said that he spoke with the former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, in September about the SNC-Lavalin Group scandal, but claims he told her at the time that it was ""her decision to make.""

But some of the government's maneuvering that - incidentally or not - helped clear the way for the charges to be dropped would suggest that Trudeau may have been actively pushing for such a resolution. For example, Trudeau's government successfully changed a law to allow for a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. And many observers were surprised when Wilson-Raybould was demoted during a seemingly arbitrary reshuffle. She has since resigned and hired attorneys to advise her about what she can and cannot say about the affair.

Trudeau acknowledged last week that his government had discussed the issue of a resolution to the charges in an effort to avoid job losses at the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada.

But the timing of the firing is difficult to ignore. And as the scandal widens, many are beginning to wonder if Trudeau will even make it to October.


It's not too late for Trudeau to resign, with a yet a little dignity. Soon that window may close too.

<p>Trudeau acknowledged last week that his government had discussed the issue of a resolution to the charges in an effort to&nbsp;avoid job losses&nbsp;at the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada.</p>

And according to the first round of polls released since the affair exploded into public view...

...it could cost Trudeau his position as prime minister and return control to the conservatives, according to the CBC.


Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead with 37% to 32% for the Liberals, while both Ipsos and Léger put the margin at 36% to 34% in the Conservatives' favour. Since December, when both polling firms were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research's polling and four percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November in the Léger poll.

The polls also showed that a large proportion of the public believes the prime minister for abruptly firing former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould over what many suspect was her decision not to bend to his will. Some 67% of Canadians are paying attention to the story, the polls show. But not everybody has made up their minds about Trudeau's involvement.

36,zerohedge,Will Trudeau Resign After Former AG's Explosive Testimony,2019-02-27 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"During a day where three concurrent Congressional hearings dominated the news cycle in the US, the testimony of Canada's former Attorney General seemed to slip under the radar. But unlike Michael Cohen's star turn in front of the House Oversight Committee, what former AG Jody Wilson-Raybould shared with lawmakers and the Canadian public actually might cause one head of state's carefully constructed house of cards to come crashing down - just as campaign season is ramping up.

With roughly eight months left until an election where Canadians will decide whether to stick with - or reject - the progressive agenda of PM Justin Trudeau, a widening corruption scandal is threatening to take down the prime minister's entire government. Two weeks ago, journalists at the Globe and Mail blew the lid off a scandal involving Trudeau and his closest aides, where the prime minister appeared to pressure Wilson-Raybould, then the attorney general, into offering a DPA to a Quebec-based engineering firm - then fired her when she refused to obey his demands. And after weeks of radio silence, she shared her side of the story during a widely watched (in Canada) Congressional hearing Wednesday afternoon.



Wilson-Raybould



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Answering questions posed by a conservative MP, Wilson-Raybould said she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats from at least 11 people involved in the government - either the PMO or the Privy Council Office - related to the SNC-Lavalin affair. She also said she was warned directly by Trudeau about the negative consequences should the company face prosecution, according to CBC. One close aide to Trudeau has already resigned over the scandal.

Wilson-Raybould listed the people she had warned about ""the inappropriate nature of these conversations"" after they ""hounded"" her about the affair, including Trudeau, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and the (now-fired) senior senior aide to the prime minister, Gerald Butts.


""For a period of four months from September to December 2018,I experience a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin.""

""Within these conversations there were express statements regarding the necessity of interfering in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC-Lavalin,"" she said.

During a series of meetings, one of which took place on Sept. 17, Wilson-Raybould described how Trudeau and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick tried to reason with her after she informed them that she had decided not to overturn a decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service to proceed with criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });

After hearing her answer, Trudeau warned of potential job losses should the company choose to move, and purportedly asked her to ""help out.""


""At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec, and that, 'I am an MP in Quebec, the MP for Papineau,'"" she recounted. 'I was quite taken aback.""

At that point, Wilson-Raybould said, she posed a direct question to Trudeau while looking him straight in the eye, asking if he was politically interfering with her role and her decision as the attorney general.

""I would strongly advise against it,"" she told the committee she warned Trudeau, who responded, ""No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.""

During another conversation, PMO senior staffer Mathieu Bouchard purportedly told Wilson-Raybould when discussing the case that ""we need to get re-elected,"" and proceeded to pressure her to change her ruling.

After repeatedly refusing to yield, she was moved in January from AG to the head of the department of Veterans' Affairs - which was widely seen as a demotion. She resigned from the cabinet soon after. It wasn't until weeks later that reports surfaced alleging that the seemingly arbitrary move may have been carried out in retribution for her refusal to cooperate on the SNC-Lavalin case.

<p>Answering questions posed by a conservative MP, Wilson-Raybould said she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats from at least 11 people involved in the government - either the PMO or the Privy Council Office - related to the SNC-Lavalin affair. She also said she was warned directly by Trudeau about the negative consequences should the company face prosecution, according to <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testifies-justice-committee-1.5035219"">CBC.&nbsp; </a>One close aide to Trudeau <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-18/justin-trudeaus-government-turmoil-after-top-aide-resigns-over-corruption"">has already resigned</a> over the scandal.</p>

<p>Wilson-Raybould listed the people she had warned about ""the inappropriate nature of these conversations"" after they ""hounded"" her about the affair, including Trudeau, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and the (now-fired) senior senior aide to the prime minister, Gerald Butts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>""For a period of four months from September to December 2018,<strong> I experience a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada </strong>in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin.""</p>

<p>""Within these conversations there were express statements regarding the necessity of interfering in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences, and veiled threats&nbsp;if a DPA was not made available to SNC-Lavalin,"" she said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During a series of meetings, one of which took place on Sept. 17, Wilson-Raybould described how Trudeau&nbsp;and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick tried to reason with her after she informed them that she had decided <em>not</em> to overturn a decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service to proceed with criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin.</p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""placement placement-embedded"" id=""in-content-1"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 250px; min-width: 300px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });</script></aside></div>

<p>After hearing her answer, Trudeau warned of potential job losses should the company choose to move, and purportedly asked her to ""help out.""</p>

<blockquote>
<p>""At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec, and that, 'I am an MP in Quebec, the MP for Papineau,'"" she recounted. 'I was quite taken aback.""</p>

<p>At that point, Wilson-Raybould said, she posed a direct question to Trudeau while looking him straight in the eye, asking if he was politically interfering with her role and her decision as the attorney general.</p>

<p>""I would strongly advise against it,"" she told the committee she warned Trudeau, who responded, ""<strong>No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>During another conversation, PMO senior staffer Mathieu Bouchard purportedly told Wilson-Raybould when discussing the case that ""we need to get re-elected,"" and proceeded to pressure her to change her ruling.</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong.

And although Trudeau's support within the Liberal Party remains relatively steady - he told reporters on Wednesday that he has no plans to resign - opposition figures are doing their best to stoke public anger with Trudeau. Late Wednesday, after Wilson-Raybould had finished her testimony, Canada's Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanded Trudeau resign, saying the prime minister had ""lost his moral authority"" to govern.

Here's more from Al Jazeera:

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority togovern"" and ""must resign"" at once.

""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

34,zerohedge,Canada's Liberals Circle The Wagons As Rivals Demand Trudeau Face Corruption Probe,2019-03-01 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"As the backlash from the biggest scandal of his political career intensified, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his standing in the polls slip, losing his lead in the October race for the first time since June. Following Wednesday's damning testimony from his former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused Trudeau and his staff of a months long campaign of veiled threats and political pressure to try and coerce her into offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm facing years old financial fraud charges.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould created an image of Trudeau that was strikingly at odds with the public's perception: The cheerful liberal crusader was cast as conniving and paranoid about his electoral prospects. Intensely worried that the SNC-Lavalin case could harm his reelection prospects by moving out of Quebec and killing thousands of jobs in his district, Trudeau was willing to unduly use his office to try and influence a criminal prosecution, and, when he didn't get his way, unceremoniously demoted the cabinet member who stood in his way.



Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Now, as his political opponents demand an official investigation, Trudeau's liberals are circling the wagons. And with the conservatives already leading in the polls - one recent poll showed Trudeau's team with 33.9% of the vote, below the conservatives with 35.8% - the Liberals worry that any break in their ranks could be fatal. So far, almost no members of Trudeau's party have spoken out against the PM (other than Wilson-Raybould, that is, who remains a Liberal MP after resigning from Trudeau's cabinet).

The goal now, according to one pollster, is to convince the public that Trudeau did nothing wrong. Though, the fact that one of the government's most high-ranking members has emerged as Trudeau's biggest critic could seriously complicate that narrative.


Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

""If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,"" Nanos said in a telephone interview. ""I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?""

Still, no current members of the cabinet have broken ranks, and some of the government's most visible members have publicly declared their support for Trudeau, and their confidence in his judgment.


Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. ""At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,"" Freeland said.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what’s legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. ""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses."" Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said.

Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada.

""They’re going to get earfuls,"" Collenette said. ""If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.""

Meanwhile, Trudeau's finance minister and one of his former top aides - who resigned after Wilson-Raybould exposed his role in the scandal - are doing everything they can to push their version of what transpired between them and the former justice minister.


Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.

""My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,"" Morneau told reporters in Toronto. ""I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.""

Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general - whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC - may also end up testifying again.

So far, Trudeau has told reporters that he has no plans to resign, even as the opposition and members of the press demand that he resign. Still, if MPs return from a two-week break that begins Friday having lost faith in Trudeau's ability to win in October, we could see the party adopt a very different strategy - perhaps one that doesn't involve Trudeau retaining his position as leader","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script><div id=""google_ads_iframe_/21841313772/zerohedge/oop_0__container__"" style=""border: 0pt currentColor; border-image: none; width: 1px; height: 1px;""></div></aside></div><p>As the backlash from the biggest scandal of his political career intensified, <strong>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his standing in the polls slip, losing his lead in the October race for the first time since June</strong>. Following <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-27/will-trudeau-resign-after-former-ags-explosive-testimony"">Wednesday's damning testimony</a> from his former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused Trudeau and his staff of a months long campaign of veiled threats and political pressure to try and coerce her into offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm facing years old financial fraud charges.</p>

<p>During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould created an image of Trudeau that was strikingly at odds with the public's perception: The cheerful liberal crusader was cast as conniving and paranoid about his electoral prospects. Intensely worried that the SNC-Lavalin case could harm his reelection prospects by moving out of Quebec and killing thousands of jobs in his district, <strong>Trudeau was willing to unduly use his office to try and influence a criminal prosecution, and, when he didn't get his way, unceremoniously demoted the cabinet member who stood in his way.</strong></p>

<p>Now, as his political opponents demand an official investigation, Trudeau's liberals are circling the wagons. And with the conservatives already leading in the polls - one recent poll showed Trudeau's team with 33.9% of the vote, below the conservatives with 35.8% - t<strong>he Liberals worry that any break in their ranks could be fatal</strong>. So far, almost no members of Trudeau's party have spoken out against the PM (other than Wilson-Raybould, that is, who remains a Liberal MP after resigning from Trudeau's cabinet).</p>

<p>The goal now, according to one pollster, is to convince the public that Trudeau did nothing wrong. Though, the fact that one of the government's most high-ranking members has emerged as Trudeau's biggest critic could seriously complicate that narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, </strong>said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.</p>

<p>""If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,"" Nanos said in a telephone interview. <strong>""I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, no current members of the cabinet have broken ranks, and some of the government's most visible members have publicly declared their support for Trudeau, and their confidence in his judgment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. <strong>""At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,""</strong> Freeland said.</p>

<p>Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what’s legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. <strong>""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.""</strong> Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said.</p>

<p>Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada.</p>

<p>""They’re going to get earfuls,"" Collenette said. <strong>""If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.""</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trudeau's finance minister and one of his former top aides - who resigned after Wilson-Raybould exposed his role in the scandal - are doing everything they can to push their version of what transpired between them and the former justice minister.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.</p>

<p>""My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,"" Morneau told reporters in Toronto. <strong>""I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.""</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events.</strong> The former attorney general - whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC - may also end up testifying again.</p>

So much for ""circling the wagons"".

One of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's most trusted ministers announced on Monday that she planned to resign from his cabinet following damning testimony last week from her close friend, former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, with whom she was closely allied when the two served in the cabinet together.

Jane Philpott, Trudeau's now-former president of the Treasury board, tweeted a statement announcing her resignation Monday afternoon. In it, she said that, after ""serious reflection"", she had decided to do the right thing and resign from the government, in keeping with her ""ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations.""



Jane Philpott

Philpott went on to explain that the constitutional convention of cabinet solidarity means ministers must defend all cabinet decisions and other ministers publicly, and must speak in support of the government and its policies.

But given the preponderance of evidence supporting Wilson-Raybould's allegations about a concerted campaign of political pressure and veiled threats orchestrated by Trudeau and senior members of his office, Philpott said she could no longer abide by this prinicple.


""Sadly,I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" Philpott said in the statement.

Political analysts in Canada have argued that presenting a united front about Trudeau's innocence would be critical if the Liberals hoped to retain control of government during October's general election.

Philpott is following Wilson-Raybould in resigning from Trudeau's government. Wilson-Raybould resigned in February after being abruptly moved to lead the veteran's affairs department during a cabinet shuffle - a move that was widely regarded as a demotion. Wilson-Raybould claimed that this move was retribution for her refusal to offer Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement, something she said at least 11 members of Trudeau's government had pressured her to do. She also claimed the prime minister himself insinuated that he wanted her to stymie the government's prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, in the hopes of preventing job losses in his district.

32,zerohedge,"Nothing To See Here': Former Trudeau Aide Denies Corruption Allegations, Resigns Anyway",2019-03-06 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"As his former boss struggles through the biggest crisis of his political career, Gerald Butts, who was until late last month the most influential aid to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appeared before the Justice Committee of the Canadian House of Commons to rebut seemingly damning testimony given last week by Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Canadian attorney general, who described a campaign of political pressure and ""veiled threats"" that she said skirted the lines of legality (though she clarified that she wasn't accusing the prime minister or his henchmen of breaking the law).

During the latest development in the corruption drama that has captivated the Canadian public since an explosive report by the Globe and Mail set it off one month ago, Butts - who resigned in the wake of the allegations - defended the prime minister and insisted that Wilson-Raybould's abrupt cabinet transfer (which was widely interpreted as a demotion) was unrelated to her decision to allow prosecution of Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to continue.



Gerald Butts



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Offering his own spin on ""nothing to see here"", Butts told the committee ""I am firmly convinced nothing happened beyond the normal operations of government"", adding that Trudeau and his office understood Wilson-Raybould would have the final word on the matter (though, of course, Butts' decision to resign over the scandal would seem to undercut this). Butts, Trudeau and aides within the privy office and prime minister's office were simply trying to encourage Wilson-Raybould to seek a ""second opinion,"" according to the BBC.

Butts admitted that Trudeau had encouraged Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow the company to avoid serious penalties that could lead to more than 9,000 Canadians losing their jobs. Because of the jobs at risk, Butts insisted that Trudeau's and his office's involvement was a matter of public policy and was completely warranted.


""All we ever asked the attorney general to do was consider a second opinion,"" Butts said.

In what sounded like a blatant attempt to undercut Wilson-Raybould's credibility, Butts offered a dramatically different account of his interactions with the former AG. Whereas she told lawmakers that Butts had told her ""there is not solution here that doesn't involve some sort of interference"", he said his conversations with the AG on the subject of SNC-Lavalin had been relatively limited.


""That's not what I said,"" Butts said.

He then produced text messages between the two which suggested that they had been ""friends"", and insisted that Wilson-Raybould didn't complain about interference until after she had been moved to lead the Ministry of Veterans Affairs.

While Wilson framed the move as political retribution for her decision not to ignore the Trudeau government's advice, Butts said he had proof that this was definitively not the case. He explained that Trudeau moved her to lead the department after the retirement of another cabinet official because he believed she was ""the only one who could handle"" managing the ministry.

Butt's full statement has been published online, and can be found here.

His testimony comes just days after Treasury board chairwoman Jane Philpott resigned because she could no longer support the Trudeau government in good conscience. Meanwhile, two investigations into Trudeau's involvement in the affair, one by the Canadian government ethics office, and one by the Commons, are underway. While Liberals have (mostly) circled the wagons, the leader of the conservative opposition has called on Trudeau to resign.

For those who are only just becoming acquainted with the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which has already destroyed the Liberal Party's lead in the polls ahead of a crucial election in October, here's a quick explainer courtesy of the Financial Times:

Global engineering and construction management company SNC-Lavalin is facing charges of fraud and corruption in relation to payments worth C$47.7m made to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011 under Muammer Gaddafi’s regime. If convicted, the company would be banned from bidding for federal government contracts for a decade.

SNC-Lavalin had hoped that the charges would be settled through a so-called deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), whereby, instead of a criminal trial, the company would pay a fine, enforce compliance measures and retain the ability to bid for contracts.

The company had lobbied federal officials for a DPA in more than 80 meetings between 2016 and 2017, according to the Globe and Mail, a Canadian national newspaper. In October 2018, Canada’s director of the public prosecution service refused to negotiate a DPA with SNC-Lavalin, a decision the company appealed against.

How is Trudeau involved?


In February, the Globe and Mail reported that in the autumn of 2018, Mr Trudeau’s office had “attempted to press” Ms Wilson-Raybould, then Canada’s attorney-general and minister of justice, to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution case to secure a DPA. In testimony to Canada’s parliamentary justice committee last week, Ms Wilson-Raybould said that she had “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere” in her handling of the case. She said it was “an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin”.

Mr Trudeau was part of the intervention, Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee. She said he had asked her to “find a solution” that would avoid SNC-Lavalin having to cut jobs or move from Montreal. Mr Trudeau has challenged her account and has denied any improper attempt to help the company avoid criminal prosecution. Ms Wilson-Raybould was named minister of veterans affairs in a cabinet reshuffle in January. She resigned a month later, following the publication of the Globe and Mail report. Days later, Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau’s longtime senior adviser, also resigned, and on Monday, Jane Philpott, a senior cabinet minister close to Ms Wilson-Raybould stepped down, saying that she had “lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter”.

What does this mean for Trudeau?


Mr Trudeau said that the conversations with Ms Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin case were within the rules. Ms Wilson-Raybould echoed this in her testimony, saying the pressure she experienced was “incredibly inappropriate” but not illegal. The controversy, however, continues to escalate and threatens to overshadow Mr Trudeau’s bid for re-election. His approval ratings had slipped dramatically since he took office in 2015 and recent polls show his ruling Liberal party neck and neck with the opposition Conservatives.

Though it's likely Trudeau will hang on the premiership for now (that is, unless some new evidence contradicting his story surfaces), it's looking increasingly likely that Canadians will reject Trudeau's Liberal agenda at the polls in October and boot the political scion out of office after just one term","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>As his former boss struggles through the biggest crisis of his political career, Gerald Butts, who was until late last month the most influential aid to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appeared before the Justice Committee of the Canadian House of Commons to rebut seemingly damning testimony given last week by Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Canadian attorney general, who described a campaign of political pressure and <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-27/will-trudeau-resign-after-former-ags-explosive-testimony"">""veiled threats"" that she said skirted the lines of legality</a> (though she clarified that she wasn't accusing the prime minister or his henchmen of breaking the law).</p>

<p>During the latest development in the corruption drama that has captivated the Canadian public since an explosive report by the Globe and Mail set it off one month ago, Butts - who resigned in the wake of the allegations - defended the prime minister and insisted that Wilson-Raybould's abrupt cabinet transfer (which was widely interpreted as a demotion) was unrelated to her decision to allow prosecution of Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to continue.</p>

<p><em>Gerald Butts</em></p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""my_spring1"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""></aside></div><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""out-placement"" id=""article-outstream"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });</script></aside></div>

<p>Offering his own spin on ""nothing to see here"", Butts told the committee ""I am firmly convinced nothing happened beyond the normal operations of government"", adding that Trudeau and his office understood Wilson-Raybould would have the final word on the matter (though, of course, Butts' decision to resign over the scandal would seem to undercut this). Butts, Trudeau and aides within the privy office and prime minister's office were simply trying to encourage Wilson-Raybould to seek a ""second opinion,"" according to the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47409909"">BBC.</a></p>

<p>Butts admitted that Trudeau had encouraged Wilson-Raybould to consider offering SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow the company to avoid serious penalties that could lead to more than 9,000 Canadians losing their jobs. Because of the jobs at risk, Butts insisted that Trudeau's and his office's involvement was a matter of public policy and was completely warranted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>""All we ever asked the attorney general to do was consider a second opinion,"" </strong>Butts said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what sounded like a blatant attempt to undercut Wilson-Raybould's credibility, Butts offered a dramatically different account of his interactions with the former AG. Whereas she told lawmakers that Butts had told her ""there is not solution here that doesn't involve some sort of interference"", he said his conversations with the AG on the subject of SNC-Lavalin had been relatively limited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>""That's not what I said,"" </strong>Butts said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then produced text messages between the two which suggested that they had been ""friends"", and insisted that Wilson-Raybould didn't complain about interference until after she had been moved to lead the Ministry of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<p>While Wilson framed the move as political retribution for her decision not to ignore the Trudeau government's advice, Butts said he had proof that this was definitively not the case. He explained that Trudeau moved her to lead the department after the retirement of another cabinet official because he believed she was ""the only one who could handle"" managing the ministry.</p>

<p>Butt's full statement has been published online, and can be found <a href=""https://medium.com/@gbutts2019/statement-to-the-house-justice-committee-681bec98e9b?sk=f8c220a2638119d758e16d8f489971de"">here. </a></p>

<p>His testimony comes <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-04/major-blow-trudeau-senior-minister-quits-over-corruption-allegations"">just days after Treasury board chairwoman Jane Philpott resigned</a> because she could no longer support the Trudeau government in good conscience. Meanwhile, two investigations into Trudeau's involvement in the affair, one by the Canadian government ethics office, and one by the Commons, are underway. While Liberals have (mostly) circled the wagons, the leader of the conservative opposition has called on Trudeau to resign.</p>

52,ZeroHedge,Trudeau Refuses To Apologize Over Corruption Scandal,2019-03-07 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is taking a page out of President Trump's book. During a Thursday press conference, Trudeau addressed the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal for the first time since his former Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould delivered damning testimony before a Commons committee and the public, detailing a campaign of political pressure and veiled threats over her refusal to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to a Quebec-based engineering firm.

During his press conference, Trudeau largely adhered to the version of events delivered by his former top aide Gerald Butts during a separate hearing earlier this week. The prime minister insisted that his government did nothing wrong by pushing Wilson-Raybould to seek a second opinion on the SNC-Lavalin case. Instead of trying to illegally bend the country's justice system, Trudeau said he was merely ""standing up for Canadian jobs.""



Trudeau feared that prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations that it bribed Libyan government officials could lead to the loss of as many as 8,000 jobs in Quebec, his home province, where he is still an MP, according to the FT.

The prime minister insisted that ""no inappropriate pressure"" was brought to bear on Wilson-Raybould, and that he has spent his entire career ""fighting for justice.""


“I’ve spent my entire political career fighting for justice,” Mr Trudeau said. “Since I started in politics I’ve always worked to the best of my ability to represent people faithfully, the SNC Lavalin [file] was no exception to this rule.”

However, Trudeau acknowledged that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have done things differently, and that ""mistakes were made."" He added that the only reason his office had pressed Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin was because he had heard she might be open to it.


Mr Trudeau added: ""We felt Ms Wilson-Raybould was ready to consider other options, and we have learnt since she was not open to that. We have learnt since that every time we mentioned it, it was inappropriate. For me and my team to continue talking about such important issues, well, that’s part of our jobs.""

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('in-content-1'); });

Most amazingly, Trudeau said that political considerations were not part of his calculus, and that the Canadian government is duty bound to stand up for workers.


Mr Trudeau said he had felt “preoccupied” with “the number of jobs involved”, but said his concerns were ""separate from any electoral concerns."" He added: ""I think people understand that a Canadian government always needs to stand up for workers, stand up for jobs and a strong economy, and that is something all Canadian governments do.""

Since the scandal broke last month, Trudeau's Liberal Party has lost its polling lead ahead of a crucial election in October. The prime minister is also facing at least two investigations - one in the Commons and one by the Canadian government's ethics office - and his political opponents have continued to call on him to resign. Perhaps the biggest blow to public confidence in his government came earlier this week when a member of his cabinet resigned because she said she could no longer support the government in good conscience.

30,zerohedge,Is Canada's Arctic Drilling Ban Hurting Its Oil Industry,2019-03-16 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via Oilprice.com,

Canada is lagging behind other oil producers in tapping its offshore oil and gas resources because of the moratorium on drilling in its Arctic waters in place since 2016 and up for review in 2021, according to Paul Barnes, Atlantic Canada and Arctic director for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).



In December 2016, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canadian Arctic waters are indefinitely off limits to new offshore oil and gas licensing, and this ban would be reconsidered every five years through a science-based review.

The recent moves by the U.S. Administration to re-open Arctic Alaska to drilling means that Canada faces “lost opportunities” in exploring its own Arctic waters, The Canadian Pressquoted CAPP’s Barnes as saying.

The Arctic drilling moratorium creates uncertainties in the Canadian oil industry and deprives the country of the chance to compete for investment in exploration, according to Barnes.

Yet, Canada’s Northern Affairs minister Dominic LeBlanc says that the ban is necessary to allow extensive consultations and ensure development that respects environment, The Canadian Press reports.

Just yesterday, CAPP said in a new report that Canada’s abundance of natural resources can help the country’s economy, but only if Canada overcomes the current market challenges by building new pipelines and other energy infrastructure.

The shortage of oil pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure “are crippling our ability to compete for global market share,” CAPP said.

“Global energy demand is growing,” CAPP president and CEO Tim McMillan said.


“However, Canada is losing the race to claim a piece of the high-growth market overseas. Without new pipelines, Canada’s oil and natural gas industry can’t compete for a share of the global market,” McMillan noted.

“Before they will invest in Canada,global investors need to see that the Canadian federal and provincial governments are firmly committed to resource development,” said McMillan","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p><a href=""https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-Canadas-Arctic-Drilling-Ban-Hurting-Its-Oil-Industry.html""><em>Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via Oilprice.com,</em></a></p>

29,zerohedge,Trudeau's Top Bureaucrat Unexpecteldy Quits Amid Growing Corruption Scandal,2019-03-18 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Since it was exposed by a report in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month, the scandal that's become known as the SNC-Lavalin affair has already led to the firing of several of Trudeau's close advisors and raised serious questions about whether the prime minister was complicit in pressuring the attorney general to offer a deferred prosecution agreement with a large, Quebec-based engineering firm.



And according to the first round of polls released since the affair exploded into public view...





googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

...it could cost Trudeau his position as prime minister and return control to the conservatives, according to the CBC.


Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead with 37% to 32% for the Liberals, while both Ipsos and Léger put the margin at 36% to 34% in the Conservatives' favour. Since December, when both polling firms were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research's polling and four percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November in the Léger poll.

Meanwhile, as the noose tightens around Trudeau, on Monday another of the key Canadian government officials at the center of the SNC-Lavalin scandal has quit his post.

Michael Wernick, clerk of the privy council, the highest-ranking position in Canada’s civil service and a key aide to Justin Trudeau, announced his retirement Monday. Trudeau named Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace him.

In a scathing letter to Trudeau, Wernick said that “recent events” led him to conclude he couldn’t hold his post during the election campaign this fall.

""It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” he said, citing the need for impartiality on the issue of potential foreign interference. According to Bloomberg, the exact date of his departure is unclear.

As we reported in February, Canada’s former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, quit following allegations that several key Trudeau government figures pressured her to intervene to end a criminal prosecution against Montreal-based construction giant SNC. Wernick was among those she named in saying the prime minister’s office wanted her to pursue a negotiated settlement.

Wernick has since twice spoken to a committee of lawmakers investigating the case, and during that testimony both defended his actions on the SNC file and warned about the risk of foreign election interference, as ""blame Putin"" has become traditional Plan B plan for most politicians seeing their careers go up in flames.

“I’m deeply concerned about my country right now, its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election,” he said in his first appearance before the House of Commons justice committee, before repeating the warning a second time this month. “If that was seen as alarmist, so be it. I was pulling the alarm. We need a public debate about foreign interference.”

Because somehow foreign interference has something to do with Wenick's alleged corruption.

Incidentally, as we wonder what the real reason is behind Wernick's swift departure, we are confident we will know soon enough.

Anyway, back to the now former clerk, who is meant to be non-partisan in service of the government of the day, also criticized comments by a Conservative senator and praised one of Trudeau’s cabinet ministers.


Wernick’s testimony was criticized as overly cozy with the ruling Liberals. Murray Rankin, a New Democratic Party lawmaker, asked the clerk how lawmakers could “do anything but conclude that you have in fact crossed the line into partisan activity?” Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said he seemed “willing to interfere in partisan fashion for whoever is in power.”

Whatever Wernick's true motives, he is the latest but not last in what will be a long line of cabinet departures as the SNC scandal exposes even more corruption in Trudeau's cabinet (some have ironically pointed out that Canada's ""beloved"" prime minister could be gone for actual corruption long before Trump). Trudeau had already lost a top political aide, Gerald Butts, to the scandal. A second minister, Jane Philpott, followed Wilson-Raybould in quitting cabinet.

Separately, on Monday, Trudeau appointed a former deputy prime minister in a Liberal government, Anne McLellan, as a special adviser to investigate some of the legal questions raised by the controversy. They include how governments should interact with the attorney general and whether that role should continue to be held by the justice minister.

As Bloomberg notes, the increasingly shaky Liberal government hasn’t ruled out helping SNC by ordering a deferred prosecution agreement in the corruption and bribery case, which centers around the company’s work in Moammar Qaddafi’s Libya. Doing so would allow the company to pay a fine and avoid any ban on receiving government contracts. That decision is up to the current attorney general, David Lametti; of course, such an action would only raise tensions amid speculation that the government is pushing for a specific political, and favorable for Trudeau, outcome","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script><div id=""google_ads_iframe_/21841313772/zerohedge/oop_0__container__"" style=""border: 0pt currentColor; border-image: none; width: 1px; height: 1px;""></div></aside></div><p>Since it was exposed by a report in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month, the scandal that's become known as the SNC-Lavalin affair has already led to the firing of several of Trudeau's <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-18/justin-trudeaus-government-turmoil-after-top-aide-resigns-over-corruption"">close advisors</a> and raised serious questions about whether the prime minister was complicit in pressuring the attorney general to offer a deferred prosecution agreement with a large, Quebec-based engineering firm.</p>

<p>...it could cost Trudeau his position as prime minister and return control to the conservatives, according to <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-polls-snclavalin-1.5026798"">the CBC.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Campaign Research showed the Conservatives ahead <strong>with 37% to 32% for the Liberals, </strong>while both Ipsos and Léger&nbsp;<strong>put the margin at 36% to 34% in the Conservatives' favour.</strong> Since December, when both polling firms&nbsp;were last in the field, the Liberals have lost one point in Campaign Research's polling and four&nbsp;percentage points in the Ipsos poll, while the party is down five points since November&nbsp;in the Léger poll.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, as the noose tightens around Trudeau, on Monday another of the key Canadian government officials at the center of the SNC-Lavalin scandal has quit his post.</p>

<p>Michael Wernick, clerk of the privy council, the highest-ranking position in Canada’s civil service and a key aide to Justin Trudeau, announced his retirement Monday. Trudeau named Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace him.</p>

<p>In a scathing letter to Trudeau, Wernick said that “recent events” led him to conclude he couldn’t hold his post during the election campaign this fall.</p>

<p>""It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” he said, citing the need for impartiality on the issue of potential foreign interference. According to <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-18/trudeau-s-top-bureaucrat-opts-to-retire-amid-snc-lavalin-scandal"">Bloomberg</a>, the exact date of his departure is unclear.</p>

<p>As we <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-18/justin-trudeaus-government-turmoil-after-top-aide-resigns-over-corruption"">reported in February</a>, Canada’s former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, <strong>quit following allegations that several key Trudeau government figures pressured her to intervene to end a criminal prosecution against Montreal-based construction giant SNC. </strong>Wernick was among those she named in saying the prime minister’s office wanted her to pursue a negotiated settlement.</p>

<p>Wernick has since twice spoken to a committee of lawmakers investigating the case, and during that testimony both defended his actions on the SNC file and warned about the risk of foreign election interference, as ""blame Putin"" has become traditional Plan B plan for most politicians seeing their careers go up in flames.</p>

<p>“I’m deeply concerned about my country right now, its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election,” he said in his first appearance before the House of Commons justice committee, before repeating the warning a second time this month. “If that was seen as alarmist, so be it. I was pulling the alarm. We need a public debate about foreign interference.”</p>

<p>Because somehow foreign interference has something to do with Wenick's alleged corruption.</p>

<p>Incidentally, as we wonder what the real reason is behind Wernick's swift departure, we are confident we will know soon enough.</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong. Please refresh and try again.</h3></div></aside>

<p>Anyway, back to the now former clerk, who is meant to be non-partisan in service of the government of the day, also criticized comments by a Conservative senator and praised one of Trudeau’s cabinet ministers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wernick’s testimony was criticized as overly cozy with the ruling Liberals. Murray Rankin, a New Democratic Party lawmaker, asked the clerk how lawmakers could “do anything but conclude that you have in fact crossed the line into partisan activity?” Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said he seemed “willing to interfere in partisan fashion for whoever is in power.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever Wernick's true motives, he is the latest but not last in what will be a long line of cabinet departures as the SNC scandal exposes even more corruption in Trudeau's cabinet (some have ironically pointed out that Canada's ""beloved"" prime minister could be gone for actual corruption long before Trump). Trudeau had already lost a top political aide, Gerald Butts, to the scandal. A second minister, Jane Philpott, followed Wilson-Raybould in quitting cabinet.</p>

<p>Separately, on Monday, Trudeau appointed a former deputy prime minister in a Liberal government, Anne McLellan, as a special adviser to investigate some of the legal questions raised by the controversy. They include how governments should interact with the attorney general and whether that role should continue to be held by the justice minister.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg notes, the increasingly shaky Liberal government hasn’t ruled out helping SNC by ordering a deferred prosecution agreement in the corruption and bribery case, which centers around the company’s work in Moammar Qaddafi’s Libya. Doing so would allow the company to pay a fine and avoid any ban on receiving government contracts. That decision is up to the current attorney general, David Lametti; of course, such an action would only raise tensions amid speculation that the government is pushing for a specific political, and favorable for Trudeau, outcome.&nbsp;</p>

28,zerohedge,Canada Sees Largest Influx Of Immigrants Since 1913,2019-03-21 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Though the mainstream media (and many in Congress) has largely dismissed President Trump's cries about an emergency along the US southern border, even the New York Times and Washington Post have acknowledged in recent weeks that the number of migrants crossing the southern border is climbing rapidly. As the number of apprehensions have increased, the situation has gotten so bad that the administration has decided to start releasing some migrant families because its detention facilities along the border have become so crowded.

And as it turns out, migration is surging north of the border as well, as Canada's statistics agency reported on Thursday that the country experienced the largest inflow of migrants in more than a century last year. Though the figures excluded illegal migrants (who have also reportedly been entering the country in record numbers), more than 320,000 people migrated to Canada last year, with more than 71,000 arriving in the final quarter - including legal refugees attracted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ""open door"" policy.



The increase is the largest since 1913, when 401,000 migrants entered Canada. The country has detailed migration data stretching all the way back to the mid-19th century.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

As birthrates in the developed world continue to slide, the influx of migrants helped Canada's population swell by more than half a million people last year, the largest annual increase since the 1950s, and the fastest pace of growth since the early 1990s. Though it's worth noting that the boom includes many foreign students, some of whom aren't planning to remain in Canada for the long term.

That was the criticism levied against the prime minister on Friday by a conservative lawmaker, who took the PM to task for ""muzzling strong, principled women"" during a debate in the House of Commons.



""He asked for strong women, and this is what they look like!"" said conservative MP Michelle Rempel, referring to the former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has accused Trudeau and his cronies of pushing her out of the cabinet after she refused to grant a deferred prosecution agreement to a Quebec-based engineering firm.

She then accused Trudeau of being a ""fake feminist"".


""That’s not what a feminist looks like...Every day that he refuses to allow the attorney general to testify and tell her story is another day he’s a fake feminist!""

Trudeau was so taken aback by Rempel's tirade, that he apparently forgot which language he should respond in.

But Rempel wasn't finished. She then segued to Trudeau's push to quash an investigation into allegations that he once groped a young journalist early in his political career. This from a man who once objected to the continued use of the word ""mankind"" (suggesting we use ""peoplekind"" instead).

The conservative opposition then tried to summon Wilson-Raybould to appear before the Commons for another hearing (during her last appearance, she shared her account of how the PM and employees in the PM's office and privy council barraged her with demands that she quash the government's pursuit of SNC-Lavalin over charges that the firm bribed Libyan government officials). Wilson-Raybould left the Trudeau cabinet after she was abruptly moved to a different ministerial post - a move that was widely seen as a demotion.

Trudeau has acknowledged that he put in a good word on the firm's behalf with Wilson-Raybould, but insists that he always maintained the final decision on the case was hers and hers alone.

Fortunately for Canadians who agree with Rempel, it's very possible that Trudeau - who has so far resisted calls to resign - won't be in power much longer, as the scandal has cost Trudeau's liberals the lead in the polls for the October election","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>Canada's feminist-in-chief Justin Trudeau wants to support and empower women...but his support stops at the point where said women start creating problems for his political agenda.</p>

In the December phone conversation, which Wilson-Raybould said she recorded because nobody was around to take notes, Michael Wernick, a top public servant and senior advisor to Trudeau who resigned over the scandal earlier this month,conveyed Mr. Trudeau's concerns with her decision on the SNC-Lavalin case, despite Wilson-Raybould's insistence that any attempt to interfere with prosecutors' decision would constitute tampering in the judicial process.

During the call, Wernick insisted that if Wilson-Raybould didn't offer the firm a deferred prosecution agreement, as had recently been allowed by a change in Canadian law, Trudeau would find a way to get it done ""one way or another.""

Mr. Wernick suggested Mr. Trudeau wanted the company to get a settlement and was going to ""find a way to get it done one way or another."" He also said he was worried, because it wasn’t good for the prime minister and attorney general to be at ""loggerheads.""

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the decision on whether to offer the company a settlement was up to prosecutors and warned that any attempt to reverse it would be seen as interference in the judicial process.

""This goes far beyond saving jobs - this is about the integrity of the prime minister,"" she said in the call. ""This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions.""

In the call, she said several times she was uncomfortable with the entire conversation.

""We are treading on dangerous ground here,"" she said in the call. ""I cannot act in a partisan way, and I cannot be politically motivated.""

A source close to the PM told WSJ that Trudeau, who has said he wanted to try and avoid job losses in politically vital Quebec (the firm risked going under if it was barred from receiving government contracts), wasn't briefed on the call. Wilson-Raybould resigned from Trudeau's cabinet in February after she was abruptly moved to a different role widely seen as a demotion.

Still, as a Parliamentary probe into the scandal ramps up, we wonder how much longer the Liberals, who have mostly closed ranks around Trudeau, can hold out","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>Try as he might to convince the Canadian people that he was merely looking out for the jobs of thousands of Quebecois, the Canadian Press and Parliament keep poking holes in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's story in a corruption scandal that has tanked his poll numbers and stoked calls for his resignation.</p>

Written by Peter Diekmeyer, Sprott Money News

The Trudeau Government continues to resist calls for an overhaul of its complex tax regime.

Yet Bill Morneau, Canada’s Minister of Finance, who was in town this week to address the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, wouldn’t name a single non-accountant that he knew who understands tax code.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Pressed by local media, the Minister admitted that he had no idea whether even his own university-educated daughters—who he has said are powerful influences on his political thinking—were able to complete their own returns.

“The subject never comes up at the supper table,” he joked.

Long-time tax reform activists greeted the news with a yawn.

“The Minister's answer speaks for itself,” says Aaron Wudrick, a director at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. “Nobody understands the tax code because it's absurdly complex.”

Cracks in Canada’s centrally-planned economy

Less well-understood is the fact that even the brightest public officials can’t measure the far-reaching implications of the Income Tax Act and other complex legislation.

That’s because much of the government’s spending comes in the form of increases in unfunded liabilities and hidden transfers caused by interest rate suppression. These expenses are kept off of the government’s books, making them almost impossible for activists like Wudrick to challenge.

This in turn raises growing questions about the overall effectiveness of Canada’s centrally-planned economy, where public spending accounts for nearly half of GDP.

Some examples:
1. Subsidizing electric vehicles, but giving bigger breaks for gas-guzzlers

Morneau’s proudest achievements include the government’s environmental record, notably the measures announced in his budget to support the electric car industry.

Unfortunately, the Canadian government also provides billions of dollars of much-larger subsidies to buyers of gas-guzzling cars, trucks and SUVs.

These stem from the lower interest rates that car buyers and other borrowers get as a result of the inflation-targeting agreement that Morneau negotiated with the Bank of Canada.

That suggests if mankind really is changing the climate, then through those hidden subsidies, government—not the private sector—may be the biggest driver.

2. Should Canada run deficits to give government employees raises?

The taxes mandated in the recent Morneau budget will be used, in part, to give pay raises to politicians and government workers.

But part of those raises will be financed by borrowing the money. This is somewhat odd. Because when ordinary folk are tapped out, they cut back.

But public sector union economists argue that if governments incur deficits to pay for new programs, those who get the cash will spend it. Then, through the “spin-off effect”, this will create jobs elsewhere, which in turn will generate more taxes that—in the long run—will bring down the deficit.

Even if he wanted to, Morneau can’t really argue with that logic. Because nobody in government tracks how much money the federal government owes or has tacitly guaranteed.

That’s because much of Canada’s public sector debt—unlike other G7 nations—is held at the provincial level and, as noted above, unfunded Medicare, pension and other liabilities are kept off the government’s books.

3. Complying with an incomprehensible tax code

The implications of Morneau’s decision to brush aside tax reform are also hard to assess.

Nobody knows the opportunity costs related to the countless hours Canadians spend filing tax returns, complying with existing regulations, and, in the case of businesses, collecting the government’s sales and payroll taxes.

These vast, hidden costs are born by the private sector but are government-related. Thus, they likely understate the cost of government to the overall Canadian economy by a significant margin.

Confused Canadians electing confused politicians

Confusing legislation like the Income Tax Act creates a vicious circle. A confused public, which doesn’t understand how their taxes are calculated nor how the cash is distributed, elects confused politicians.

These confused politicians hire confused bureaucrats, who in turn do confusing research. This bad research further confuses the public, who in turn elect increasingly confused politicians.

More broadly, Canada may be gradually degenerating from reasoned -but-increasingly-complex income redistribution into a mob-rule democracy, in which the public has no clue what it is voting for.

Fostering financial illiteracy

Much of the problem can be traced back to Canada’s public schools, colleges and universities.

Most students spend at least twelve years in Canada’s school system. Yet despite the fact that after graduating, workers will spend nearly their half their lives paying for government, they aren’t taught how to calculate the taxes they will owe.

Wudrick is well aware of the implications.

“It would be foolish for anyone to try to do their own taxes without software or hiring an accountant,” says the long-time activist. “It's an immense waste of time and requires an increasingly bigger bureaucracy to administer. Government after government clogs (the system) with loopholes, credits and complicated measures. But they seem allergic to overhauling the tax code.”

In a perfect world, Wudrick’s insights would illuminate Morneau.

Sadly, Canada’s Finance Minister—who attended the University of Western Ontario—is himself a casualty of the country’s publicly-financed schooling. There, like most Canadians, he was taught the glories, but not the costs, of government.

The good news for Morneau is that the Canadian public continues to love and trust government and the paper dollars, bonds and other securities that it issues and guaranties.

Gold investors need to decide whether that trust is merited.

Former Treasury Board minister Jane Philpott, who resigned from Trudeau's cabinet in protest after the scandal broke, has asked the speaker of Canada's House of Commons to rule that Trudeau violated Canadian law when he unilaterally expelled her and former Justice Minister and AG Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Party caucus last week.

According to the Globe and Mail, a law called the Parliament of Canada Act - which was amended in 2015 to include a process for expelling members from a party caucus - stipulates that a caucus vote via secret ballot must be held before an MP can be ejected. Trudeau didn't hold a vote before effectively exiling the two dissident women from the party last week.

Philpott and Wilson-Raybould

Trudeau told journalists last week he made the decision to oust them, saying ""I have taken the decision to expel the honourable members from caucus.""

For those who haven't been following the scandal, it started when the Globe and Mail reported earlier this year that Trudeau had pushed Wilson-Raybould out of his cabinet by demoting her to a lesser position after she refused to offer SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm accused of corruption for bribing Libyan government officials, a deferred prosecution in accordance with the PM's wishes. During testimony before a Parliamentary committee, Wilson-Raybould described a campaign of inappropriate political pressure carried out by employees in Trudeau's office and the privy service, supposedly at the direction of the PM.

When Wilson-Raybould refused, she was moved during a cabinet shakeup. Wilson-Raybould has alleged that Trudeau was concerned about job losses in his home constituency in Quebec should SNC-Lavalin be stripped of its ability to win government contracts. The prime minister has maintained that he did nothing wrong, and that he told Wilson-Raybould that the decision was ultimately hers to make.

Adding a layer of irony to the situation, both MPs, who resigned from Trudeau's cabinet in March, were part of the new wave of more diverse MPs elected in 2015, and were part of the ""gender balanced"" cabinet appointed by the PM in 2017 after his electoral victory. Trudeau's treatment of the two has prompted accusations that Trudeau is a ""fake feminist"" - claims that will undoubtedly be bolstered by the fact that he violated the law to discriminate against them.

With the party's standing in the polls sliding due to the scandal, the Liberal majority has nevertheless rallied around their leader, recently blocking two Commons committee investigations into the scandal.

The opposition, meanwhile, has called on Trudeau to resign. But without any pressure from within his own party, it's unlikely that he will acquiesce to these demands","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can't seem to get out of his own way.</p>

In the midst of one of the most de-stabilizing scandals to rock Canada in years, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced on April 5 that the threat of “Foreign interference” going into the October 2019 elections was at an all-time high.



Sitting beside her UK counterpart at a G7 meeting in France, Freeland stated: 



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });


“Interference is very likely and we think there have already been efforts by malign foreign actors to disrupt our democracy”. Her warning was echoed by an embattled puppet Prime Minister in Ottawa who stated it is “very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns … that have turned our politics even more divisive and more anger-filled than they have been in the past.”

The Measures to Defend the British Deep State

In order to counteract this “foreign threat”, several Canadian mechanisms have been announced to “keep democracy safe” in alignment with the G7, Five Eyes and NATO. These mechanisms are:
The creation of an “Incident Public Protection Panel” run by five Privy Council bureaucrats under the Clerk of the Privy Council which will exist outside of the authority of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, whose job is to maintain the integrity of elections. In defense of this mysterious group, Canada’s Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould stated that “it won’t be one person who will decide what Canadians will be allowed to know” (apparently having five people decide is more democratic). The new Clerk of the Privy Council is Ian Stugart, who served as former deputy minister to Chrystia Freeland until just a few weeks ago.

A Security and Intelligence Election Threats Task Force which will incorporate all of Canada’s intelligence agencies such as the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the RCMP, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and Freeland’s Global Affairs Canada. All of these agencies are Privy Council organizations.

The Rapid Response Mechanism of the G7 created in June 2018 and headquartered in Ottawa Canada in Freeland’s Global Affairs Office and Privy Council Office.

While Russia is being set up as the scapegoat of the collapsing western liberal establishment, this most recent red alarm by Freeland and Canada’s response to the “danger” is useful for two reasons:
First and foremost, Freeland’s shameless warnings over “foreign interference” have become so loud that an irony has become unavoidable. She has after all been caught red handed behind the destabilization of both Ukraine and Venezuela. Secondly, by reviewing the mechanisms being created by Canada to counter-act this “threat”, a clear insight is provided into the inner workings of the actual foreign influences which infiltrated Canada many decades ago.

Chrystia Freeland: Regime Change Princess of Ukraine and Venezuela

On the first point, Freeland’s role as a co-architect of the nazi-fueled overthrow of a pro-Russian government in February 2014 is now well known. Aside from her family’s Nazi connections going back to her grandfather Michael Chomiak’s leading role as a Nazi collaborator in WWII, and her own mother’s role in helping to draft Ukraine’s neo-liberal constitution, Freeland herself not only befriended leading neo-Nazi collaborators such as Canadian Ukrainian Congress’ president Paul Grod and but has also promoted NATO’s anti-Russian expansion across eastern Europe.



Less well known but equally important is Freeland’s leading role in planning for the Venezuelan coup attempt which has been recently halted thanks to Russia’s March 23rd intervention.

Working alongside fellow Oxford operative Ben Rowswell (now head of the Canadian International Council/ Chatham House of Canada) during his three year tenure as Ambassador to Venezuela (2014-2017), Freeland set up a program for regime change which involved a two-part formula of 1) mobilizing mass direct support for the overthrow of a government, and 2) gaining international support for said overthrow.

Rowswell’s on-the-ground work was designed to achieve the former as he himself admitted in a 2017 interview saying “We became one of the most vocal embassies in speaking out on human rights issues and encouraging Venezuelans to speak out”. Before leaving his post to become the head of the Chatham House of Canada, he tweeted “I don’t think they (anti-Maduro forces) have anything to worry about because Minister Freeland has Venezuela way at the top of her priority list”.

Working on fulfilling the 2nd part of the formula, Freeland directed the creation of the “Lima Group”. A Global News article of January 24 described the group in the following terms: 


“Playing a key role behind the scenes was Lima Group member Canada, whose Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland spoke to Guaido the night before Maduro’s swearing-in ceremony to offer her government’s support should he confront the socialist leader”.

It shouldn’t be too surprising in our day and age that a nation with such a high reputation as “polite Canada” is actuality, an active agency for regime change and global governance. Canada’s very Prime Minister did assert in 2016 that “Canada is the world’s first post national-state nation”. What may surprise some readers is that Canada itself was infiltrated by a foreign player many years ago and what we will briefly see is that Canada can only be called the “world’s first post national-state nation” because it never really became a genuine nation in the first place, but was always manipulated by a foreign power... although not the one you think.

The “Foreign Influence” Controlling Canada

While a longer presentation is needed to do this story justice, it is enough to note for now that neither Freeland, nor Rowswell are operating on behalf of Canada’s interests, but are rather both operatives run by an entity that took over Canada many decades ago and are currently directed by two interlocking organizations: The Privy Council Office and the Rhodes-Milner Round Table Group.

The Privy Council Office

The Privy Council office was set up in 1867 in order to act as the British hand guiding its newly formed confederacy (Canada nearly became a part of Lincoln’s America in the wake of the Civil War. The only thing stopping that outcome was Britain’s creation of a confederation. The full story is told in the Imperial Myth of Canada’s National Policy.). While its power was always great, there was still room for independent policy making by nationalistic elected officials when the international conditions were favorable.

This was nearly entirely destroyed during the reign of technocratic golden boy Pierre Elliott Trudeau during his 1968-1973 reform of the Federal Government under the guidance of the OECD’s Sir Alexander King. It was during this time Sir King’s Club of Rome (Ottawa branch) was set up in Ottawa under the guidance of Trudeau and his clerk of the Privy Council Michael Pitfield, and other neo-Malthusian technocrats such as Privy Council President Michel Lamontagne, Maurice Strong, and Governor General Roland Mitchener. It was from this control point in Ottawa in 1971 that the work later to become known as Limits to Growth was funded by tax payers and which became the bible for the new Malthusianism and blueprint for the “post-industrial society”. It is from this cybernetics central node that the web of governance both in Canada and also across other British infiltrated territories in the Trans-Atlantic system is coordinated under the directives of London.



Sir Alexander King, working through the Club of Rome advanced the Malthusian revival known as “Carrying Capacity” which presupposed a world of fixed resources and discounted the parameter of human creativity

The current President of the Privy Council is Justin Trudeau’s childhood friend Dominic Leblanc, son of former Governor General (i.e.: Head of State of Canada) and co-controller of the Canada 2020 think tank which created Justin as an Obama-modelled puppet in 2006. Following in the footsteps of Pierre Trudeau’s Limits to Growth, it is this very network which is at the heart of the Green New Deal now being pushed internationally. Another leading member of Canada2020 is Facebook Canada’s Kevin Chan who will be working closely with the Freeland’s Security and Intelligence Election Threats Task Force.

The oath of every member of the Privy Council member (which includes both private individuals and also every cabinet minister of government) is: “I, [name], do solemnly and sincerely swear that I shall be a true and faithful servant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, as a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Canada.” Additionally to becoming a Privy Councillor, the Prime Minister must additionally give another oath stating: “I, [name] do swear (declare) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors.

Coordinating closely with the Privy Council office for over 100 years is an organization known as the Round Table Group (c.1902) which was created with funds from South Africa’s “race patriot” and diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes who wished to use his wealth in order to advance a “church for the extension of the British Empire” and “the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire.”

Upon Rhodes’ death in 1902, Lord Alfred Milner directed Rhodes’ trust and created the Round Table Movement across all British Territories. The trust was also directed towards the creation of the Rhodes Scholarship system designed to indoctrinate talented young minds around the world in Oxford before deploying them back into their countries of origin in order to infiltrate all public and private fields of influence. The Roundtable groups (dubbed the Council on Foreign Relations upon its creation in the United States in 1921), changed its name several times and today is known as the Royal Institute for International Affairs/Chatham House in the UK and the Canadian International Council (CIC) in Ottawa*.



Regime Change disciple Ben Rowswell’s presidency as head of the CIC and Chrystia Freeland’s status as an Oxford Rhodes Scholar (having been brought into Liberal politics via Rhodes Scholar/Canada2020 controller Bob Rae in 2013) should give any thinker a moment of grave pause.

The Strategic Issue at Hand

As ugly as this picture may appear to some, it should not cause sadness or even anger.

Only pity mixed with a dose of hope are appropriate, since we are in fact witnessing the desperate death rattle of a Monarchical system of empire which has too long poisoned the well of human civilization and which must now give way for something better. Although this imperial system may be deploying every asset and dirty trick it has in opposition to the new paradigm now emerging under the guiding leadership of Russia and China, it is becoming increasingly clear that this empire cannot win. Its regime change plans have failed, its Green New Deals are failing and even the irrational aesthetical traditions underlying this system of post-modernism are giving way to an optimistic artistic sensibility that seeks to re-unite beauty with truth evidenced by the renewed interest in classical art and music during the recent Belt and Road Musical Festival on March 24, 2019.



Russia and China’s leadership have not only consolidated a partnership of nations across Eurasia and Africa around this new paradigm, but they have also found what no one thought was possible just a few years ago: a potential ally in an America which is returning to its nationalist sensibilities under the surprising leadership of Donald Trump.

During Trump’s two first years as President, the long British infiltration of America has finally begun to fall apart with the collapse of the Mueller investigation and the exposure of the British-run deep state that Mueller was a part of.

The question now remains: With the impending meltdown of the trans-Atlantic financial system, and olive branch of cooperation which China has offered to the west via the Belt and Road Initiative and the World Landbridge which can bring this system of development into the Americas and Africa, will America join hands as an ally and will Canada follow suit in order to become a true sovereign nation freed of all foreign imperial influence once and for all","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p><a href=""https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2019/04/15/canada-russia-interference-okay-if-destabilizes-you-but-not-other-way-around.html""><em>Authored by Matthew Ehret via The Strategic Culture Foundation,</em></a></p>

<p>This was nearly entirely destroyed during the reign of technocratic golden boy Pierre Elliott Trudeau during his&nbsp;<a href=""http://canadianpatriot.org/origins-of-deep-state-part2/"">1968-1973 reform</a>&nbsp;of the Federal Government under the guidance of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/OWTU/TC-OWTU-740.pdf"">OECD’s Sir Alexander King.</a>&nbsp;It was during this time Sir King’s Club of Rome (Ottawa branch) was set up in Ottawa under the guidance of Trudeau and his clerk of the Privy Council Michael Pitfield, and other neo-Malthusian technocrats such as Privy Council President Michel Lamontagne, Maurice Strong, and Governor General Roland Mitchener. It was from this control point in Ottawa in 1971 that the work later to become known as&nbsp;<em>Limits to Growth</em>&nbsp;was funded by tax payers and which became the bible for the new Malthusianism and blueprint for the “post-industrial society”. It is from this cybernetics central node that the web of governance both in Canada and also across other British infiltrated territories in the Trans-Atlantic system is coordinated under the directives of London.</p>

<p>Coordinating closely with the Privy Council office for over 100 years is an organization known as the Round Table Group (c.1902) which was created with funds from South Africa’s “race patriot” and diamond magnate&nbsp;<a href=""http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~wmills/rhodes_confession.html"">Cecil Rhodes</a>&nbsp;who wished to use his wealth in order to advance a&nbsp;<em>“church for the extension of the British Empire”</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>“the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire.”</em></p>

<p>Upon Rhodes’ death in 1902, Lord Alfred Milner directed Rhodes’ trust and created the&nbsp;<a href=""http://canadianpatriot.org/origins-of-deep-state-part1/"">Round Table Movement across all British Territories.</a>&nbsp;The trust was also directed towards the creation of the Rhodes Scholarship system designed to indoctrinate talented young minds around the world in Oxford before deploying them back into their countries of origin in order to infiltrate all public and private fields of influence. The Roundtable groups (dubbed the Council on Foreign Relations upon its creation in the United States in 1921), changed its name several times and today is known as the Royal Institute for International Affairs/Chatham House in the UK and the Canadian International Council (CIC) in Ottawa*.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Strategic Issue at Hand</strong></u></h3>

<p><strong>As ugly as this picture may appear to some, it should not cause sadness or even anger.</strong></p>

<p>Only pity mixed with a dose of hope are appropriate, since we are in fact witnessing the desperate death rattle of a Monarchical system of empire which has too long poisoned the well of human civilization and which must now give way for something better. Although this imperial system may be deploying every asset and dirty trick it has in opposition to the new paradigm now emerging under the guiding leadership of Russia and China, it is becoming increasingly clear that this empire cannot win. Its regime change plans have failed, its&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.sott.net/article/407379-The-Technocrats-and-the-Green-New-Deal"">Green New Deals</a>&nbsp;are failing and even the irrational aesthetical traditions underlying this system of post-modernism are giving way to an optimistic artistic sensibility that seeks to re-unite beauty with truth evidenced by the renewed interest in classical art and music during the recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2019ShenzhenBRIMF.html"">Belt and Road Musical Festival</a>&nbsp;on March 24, 2019.</p>

A marijuana shortage left the industry in shock earlier this year and caused concerns that Canadian cannabis producers were not properly structured to handle the massive demand from the Canadian marketplace.



As a result, a majority of marijuana sales in the country -- approximately $5 billion -- were transacted on the black market, compared to $2 billion in legal sales, according to new government data from January 2019.

Pot smoking Canadians purchased 6,671 kilograms of legal cannabis in February, down 9% from January, and the lowest amount since October when 6,415 kilograms were sold, according to Health Canada.

While the legal cannabis market has been hit with supply chain bottlenecks and overpricing, the black market continued to flourish into 2Q.

Canadians paid 57% on average more for legal cannabis than they did from their drug dealer, according to the data.

Since October [the month when pot became legal], consumers purchasing legal cannabis paid $7.47 per gram on average, compared with buyers on the black market who paid an average $4.70 per gram.

Industry experts believe the illicit cannabis market will continue to expand by offering affordable weed to all.

""As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,"" Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative think tank, told the Guardian. ""The government was aware that it wouldn't fully displace the black market on day one.""

A recent survey of 500 pot smokers conducted by BMO Capital Markets found that 35% of all respondents indicated they have purchased legal cannabis. BMO's survey responses also suggest that muted legal sales were due to supply shortages and overpricing.

Ahead of legalization last October, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, emphasized that legal pot would eliminate the black market. Unfortunately, Trudeau has been terribly mistaken as the illicit market continues to expand","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p>Six months after Canada became the first country in the developed world to legalize marijuana, legal sales of dried cannabis flower went up in smoke as consumers <a href=""https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pot-sales-fell-in-february-as-producers-hoard-supply-ahead-of-edibles-launch-1.1245882"">shifted</a> to illicit markets.</p>

<p>Industry experts believe the illicit cannabis market will continue to expand by offering affordable weed to all.</p>

<p>""As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,"" Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative think tank, told the Guardian. ""The government was aware that it wouldn't fully displace the black market on day one.""</p>

<p>A recent survey of 500 pot smokers conducted by BMO Capital Markets found that 35% of all respondents indicated they have purchased legal cannabis. BMO's survey responses also suggest that muted legal sales were due to supply shortages and overpricing.</p>

<p>Ahead of legalization last October, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, emphasized that legal pot would eliminate the black market. Unfortunately, Trudeau has been terribly mistaken as the illicit market continues to expand.</p>

20,zerohedge,Trudeau Declares Climate Emergency... Then Approves Major Oil Pipeline,2019-06-21 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Nick Cunningham via OilPrice.com,

Canada declared a national climate emergency on Monday. The next day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the greenlight to a massive oil sands pipeline.



The House of Commons, with strong support declared climate change a “real and urgent crisis.” A week before, Justin Trudeau proposed a ban on single-use plastics, which, if implemented, would be the latest in a growing number of bans on plastic that could put multibillion-dollar bets on plastics and petrochemicals by the oil industry at risk.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

But Trudeau has never really stood in the way of Canada’s oil industry, despite years of platitudes about addressing climate change. That was clear on June 18, when he gave the approval to the Trans Mountain Expansion (not for the first time), a $4.5 billion twin pipeline that would run along an existing line from Alberta to the Pacific Coast in British Columbia.



The Trans Mountain Expansion is one of a few high-profile pipeline projects that have run into serious trouble. Trudeau first gave the greenlight in 2016, but the project ran aground amid legal challenges from First Nations and environmental groups. Last year, Kinder Morgan, the original owner of the project, headed for the exit, threatening the cancel the project altogether.

Desperate to keep it alive – and the clearest example imaginable of how much the Canadian government depends on the oil industry – Trudeau moved to nationalize the project in mid-2018, buying it off of Kinder Morgan’s hands. A year later, here we are, with Ottawa once again trying to push it forward.

“This isn’t an either/or proposition. It is in Canada’s national interest to protect our environment and invest in tomorrow, while making sure people can feed their families today,” Trudeau said on Tuesday. Despite Trudeau’s plea, many see it precisely as an either/or proposition. Faced with a binary choice, Trudeau could either anger the oil industry, or anger First Nations and environmental groups. He chose the former, even though that was mostly expected.

“The approval comes as no surprise—the federal government owns the pipeline after all,” Scotiabank’s Rebekah Young wrote in a note. The Canadian government has vowed to build the project with a Crown corporation, then turn it over to private investors or some other company.

But the next step is unclear.

The approval from Trudeau’s government is a “positive step” for the project, but “project execution risk remains elevated,” Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. The investment bank said that while the government plans to begin construction this year, Goldman is not factoring the project into its base-case forecasts, “given prior uncertainty in the outlook of this project.”


“Today’s decision is a positive development for Canada’s western oil sector, but it will have little impact on short term production,” Rebekah Young for Scotiabank said. The expansion will triple the pipeline system’s current capacity, taking it up to 890,000 bpd.

“However, with the earliest completion date only by 2022,” Young added.

Still, commencing construction on the project would be seen as a breakthrough for Canada’s oil industry.


“We would also anticipate that reaching surety in construction of TMX would provide oil sand producers confidence to commence re-investing in production growth, given the capital constrained budgets most companies are now operating under,” Goldman analysts said.

“That said, we continue to see pipeline shortages until at least 2022…and during this period from now until then, see light-heavy differentials wider than pipeline economics.”

The inability to build a new pipeline had diminished production growth in Canada’s oil sands, and could limit output in the long run. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) just released its 2019 Crude Oil Forecast, and lowered its estimate for production growth to 1.44 percent annually through 2035, less than half its prior estimate from 2014.

“Pipeline constraints, a lack of market diversity, and inefficient regulations are largely responsible for holding back Canada’s oil sector,” CAPP said.

Oil forecasts aside, the Trans Mountain Expansion will still run into stiff resistance from First Nations and environmental groups. “The Trudeau government does not have the right to put a pipeline through unceded Secwepemc land,” spokeswoman Kanahus Manuel said, according to Reuters. More lawsuits and protests are inevitable.

Moreover, the pipeline needs permits from British Columbia, where the government has opposed the project.


“[T]he project still faces significant political, regulatory, and judicial challenges, and ultimately we see a tremendous amount of execution risk up until the oil starts flowing,” Gavin MacFarlane, a VP with Moody’s Investors Service, said in comments circulated to reporters.

Meanwhile, the other pipeline that could potentially add takeaway capacity from Alberta – Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement – hit another snag. State agencies in Minnesota said on Tuesday that they would not issue permits until a revised environmental review was completed, following a recent court order that said the state had failed to adequately assess the potential impact of an oil spill. In short, permits could be delayed longer than expected.

If Line 3 fails to move forward for any reason, that increases the stakes and importance for the Trans Mountain Expansion as the only route left for new pipeline capacity.

Written by Peter Diekmeyer, Sprott Money News

Business insiders were shocked when David Macdonald, an economist with the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives, revealed that the Big Banks got nearly $114 billion in secret bailout support after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

The story, which was quite technical, got major attention from specialists. However, since the process provided poor sound bites, mainstream media quickly moved on.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

The issue died long before the 2015 election.

Today, it’s thus hardly a surprise that global experts such as the International Monetary Fund now laud the resilience of Canada’s banks.

Yet few of those experts saw the previous crisis coming. With another election scheduled this fall, it makes sense to ask whether Canadians should bail out the big banks again should another crisis come.

“One of the biggest challenges is that we still can’t confirm which banks got what money from which sources,” says Macdonald, who estimates that RBC, Scotiabank, TD, CIBC, and BMO got an average of $22 billion each. “It’s also not at all clear whether some of the banks actually needed the cash.”

Further complicating the question is the fact that Canada’s banking system already benefits from a vast range of subsidies.

Consider:
The fractional reserve system: should banks be allowed to “print” money?

The most blatant subsidy that Canadian banks benefit from is their collective ability to leverage a complicated zero reserve system to “create money” via interbank borrowing and to thus benefit from interest free loans.

John Kenneth Galbraith once said that the process through which banks operate “repels the mind.”

It’s stunningly complex, and even many sector professionals themselves don’t understand it. Ask a bank teller or public relations official and all you will get is a blank look.

But the guys pulling the strings know. That’s how they get away with it.

Banning competition facilitates price gouging

The second implicit subsidy that Canada’s banks get is protection from competition. This enables them to gouge consumers by charging higher prices on almost all their services.

Private citizens, for example, are banned from starting their own banks, as is foreign competition.

Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and payments systems are locked out, or they are loaded with so many regulations that they cannot operate effectively.

This enables the big banks to run a quasi oligopoly. The result is that bank credit card interest rates often exceed 20%. Transferring $300 from London, New Delhi, or New York to Canada costs more than $20.

Interest rate subsidies caused by tacit bailout promise

Although most Canadians remain unaware of the fact that the Big Banks were bailed out during that last financial crisis, insiders and bank executives themselves know.

For example, Macdonald quotes then-TD Bank CEO Edmund Clark as telling investors: “What are the chances that TD Bank is not going to be bailed out if we do something stupid?”

This implicit guarantee that bank CEOs will keep their jobs and their bonuses, no matter how they act, enables them to borrow and lend at maximum capacity to just about anyone who has a pulse.

This creates vast short-term profits for the banks, with bailout subsidies that will be required later, financed by taxpayers.

Do banks deserve another bailout?

One good way to reassert controls would be to re-establish a gold standard, to deregulate financial markets, and allow the losers to fail.

That said, the question about whether Canadian banks should be bailed out is far more complicated than it appears.

While gold investors are justifiably leery, Canadians love their big banks.

The RBC, CIBC, BMO, Scotiabank, and TD are swimming in cash, much of it from loyal customers who haveracked up $6.4 trillion in system debts.

Canadian governments, businesses, and consumers are not just addicted to debt, they are addicted toincreases in debt.

If credit ever stopped growing for any length of time, the economy would simply implode.

Allowing Canadians banks to fail would be like putting a drug addict’s dealer in prison.

We know it’s the right thing to do. We know it needs to be done. We also know that the sooner it’s done the better. But it wouldn’t be easy.

“Unfortunately the veil of secrecy is obscuring an obvious reality,” says Macdonald. “Canada’s banks are too big to fail.”

46,zerohedge,Justin Trudeau Broke Federal Ethics Rules In Corruption Scandal,2019-08-14 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"In a hotly anticipated report released months after a former member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet alleged that Trudeau and several members of his inner circle had tried to pressure her into dropping criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, Canadian Ethics commissioner Mario Dion has ruled that, in doing so, Trudeau violated a section of the Conflict of Interest Act.



Justin Trudeau

In a report published on Wednesday,the commissioner said Trudeau used his position of authority over Jody Wilson-Raybould, the aforementioned former AG and Justice Minister,to try and convince her to halt a criminal prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering giant. According to the report, Trudeau violated Canada's federal Conflict of Interest Act.

""The prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson‑Raybould,"" Dion said.

""The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson‑Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.""

Dion specifically cited Section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act, which prohibits public officials from ""using their position to seek to influence a decision to improperly further the private interests of a third party, either by acting outside the scope of their legislative authority, or contrary to a rule, a convention or an established process.""

The SNC-Lavalin scandal, as it came to be known, ultimately led to the departure of two Trudeau cabinet officials, and the departure of several senior figures from his staff. The opposition has called on him to resign.

As Dion noted in his report, it was not enough just to seek to influence someone else for an action to break the rules.

There had to be a specific desire to ""improperly further the interests of SNC-Lavalin.""

Does this mean Trudeau's Liberal Party will finally abandon its leader? Or is it too close to the October federal elections, where Trudeau is expected to seek a second term, to change course now? Either way, it's good news for his conservative opponents who are trying to retake control of Ottawa.

18,zerohedge,Virtue-Signaling Canadians Love Carbon Initiatives...Until They Have To Pay For Them,2019-08-30 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Canadians are super environmentally friendly - until they have to pay for it.



According to new data released by the Public Policy Forum's Digital Democracy Project, Canadian voters rank the environment as their second greatest political concern - voicing widespread support for reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.

That support quickly melts, however, when voters are asked to personally pay more to combat climate change, according to The Star.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

""It’s a general human phenomenon that we don’t align personal sacrifice with personality priorities. I mean, that’s why people don’t exercise, right?,"" said University of Toronto political science professor and survey lead for the Digital Democracy Project, Peter Loewen.

""I think what’s happening here, frankly with the carbon tax, is the government has chosen an instrument that’s very visible, in which the cost can be expressed and the cost can be exaggerated, but the cost is very understandable to citizens.""


The environment and climate change are expected to be central issues in the upcoming federal election campaign. The Liberal government has brought in a carbon levy of $20 per tonne of emissions this year, rising to $50 per tonne in 2022.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has attempted to walk a line between action on climate change and support for the country’s natural resources sector, notably through the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

The Conservatives oppose the carbon levy and, while they promise to crack down on heavy industrial emitters, are offer no targets for emission reductions.

The good news for the Liberals is that not only is the environment a major political issues for Canadians — with 17 per cent of respondents saying it’s the most important issue to them — but there is strong support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. -The Star

While 74% of respondents said they are in favor of Canada reducing emissions - mostly through renewable energy subsidies (72%), just 36% said they would support increasing the carbon tax.

What's more, the survey revealed that Canadians are extremely sensitive to increases in the carbon price by breaking respondents up into three groups; ""one group told a carbon tax would increase the cost of gasoline by five cents a litre, another group by 10 cents, and the final group by 15 cents.""

""At five cents, 42 per cent of respondents are estimated to oppose a carbon tax, but this rises to 51 per cent at 15 cents per litre,"" the survey reveals. ""This finding illustrates the political perils of using carbon taxes to secure emissions reductions needed to meet Canada’s international obligations.""


Opposition to raising the carbon price was clearly split along partisan lines. A majority of Conservative voters opposed the carbon price at any cost, while supporters of the left-leaning Liberals, New Democrats, Greens and Bloc Québécois were unresponsive to a hike in the price. -The Star


""This lack of responsiveness to the price could possibly be because these respondents are more willing to accept sacrifices needed to reduce emissions,"" the report reads. ""(But) non-partisans appear to behave more like right-leaning partisans. At five cents, they share a similar level of opposition to the carbon tax as left-leaning partisans (41 per cent each).

<p>According to new data released by the Public Policy Forum's Digital Democracy Project, Canadian voters rank the environment&nbsp;<strong>as their second greatest political concern</strong>&nbsp;- voicing widespread support for reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>That support quickly melts, however,&nbsp;<strong>when voters are asked to personally pay more to combat climate change</strong>, according to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/08/29/canadian-voters-like-carbon-initiatives-but-not-paying-for-them-poll-finds.html""><em>The Star</em></a>.</p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""my_spring1"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""></aside></div><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""out-placement"" id=""article-outstream"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });</script></aside></div>

<p>""<strong>It’s a general human phenomenon that we don’t align personal sacrifice with personality priorities.</strong> I mean, that’s why people don’t exercise, right?,"" said University of Toronto political science professor and survey lead for the Digital Democracy Project, Peter Loewen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>""I think what’s happening here, frankly with the carbon tax, is the government has chosen an instrument that’s very visible, in which the cost can be expressed and the cost can be exaggerated, but the cost is very understandable to citizens.""</p>

<p>The Conservatives oppose the carbon levy and, while they promise to crack down on heavy industrial emitters, are offer no targets for emission reductions.</p>

<p>While 74% of respondents said they are in favor of Canada reducing emissions - mostly through renewable energy subsidies (72%),&nbsp;<strong>just 36% said they would support increasing the carbon tax</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What's more, the survey revealed that Canadians are extremely sensitive to increases in the carbon price by breaking respondents up into three groups; ""one group told a carbon tax would increase the cost of gasoline by five cents a litre, another group by 10 cents, and the final group by 15 cents.""&nbsp;</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong.

<p>""<strong>At five cents, 42 per cent of respondents are estimated to oppose a carbon tax, but this rises to 51 per cent at 15 cents per litre</strong>,"" the survey reveals. ""This finding illustrates the political perils of using carbon taxes to secure emissions reductions needed to meet Canada’s international obligations.""&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Opposition to raising the carbon price was clearly split along partisan lines. A majority of Conservative voters opposed the carbon price at any cost, while supporters of the left-leaning Liberals, New Democrats, Greens and Bloc Québécois were unresponsive to a hike in the price. -<a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/08/29/canadian-voters-like-carbon-initiatives-but-not-paying-for-them-poll-finds.html""><em>The Star</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
""This lack of responsiveness to the price could possibly be because these respondents are more willing to accept sacrifices needed to reduce emissions,"" the report reads. ""(But) non-partisans appear to behave more like right-leaning partisans. At five cents, they share a similar level of opposition to the carbon tax as left-leaning partisans (41 per cent each).

According to the CBC, Trudeau will visit the governor general at 10 am ET.

Trudeau and his rivals have rallies planned for Wednesday to mark the kick-off of campaign season. Trudeau is expected to hold a rally shortly after the campaign launch. Afterwards, Trudeau will board the Liberal Party's plane to start campaigning around the country.

Trudeau is launching campaign season one day before the first debate in Toronto, where every party leader will participate except for Trudeau, who is still uneasy about the scandal that nearly toppled his administration earlier this year.

The Liberals, who control the government, have 177 MPs in the 338-seat Canadian House of Commons. Conservatives have 95 MPs, while the NDP has 39 MPs. Meanwhile, there are 10 Bloc Québécois MPs, 2 Green MPs, and 1 People’s Party of Canada MP, one Co-operative Commonwealth Federation MP, 8 independents and 5 vacant seats.

Trudeau's Liberals will be seeking a second four-year mandate. During the campaign, they're expected to tout the party's accomplishments on reducing child poverty and creating jobs, while hoping to sidestep criticism over the SNC-Lavalin ethics scandal.

Ottawa blocks RCMP on SNC-Lavalin inquiry - The Globe and Mail #SNCLavalin #cdnpoli #elex43 https://t.co/ND65by97Nb
— Robert Fife (@RobertFife) September 11, 2019
Earlier in the year, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion reportedly faced similar stonewalling during his own independent inquiry into the affair - wherein Trudeau allegedly pushed out his Justice Minister and Attorney General after she refused to offer a non prosecution agreement to an engineering firm based in Trudeau's home province. Trudeau worried that if the prosecution continued, and the firm was forced to close, he might lose critical support in his home district.

The RCMP were reportedly investigating serious claims that Trudeau obstructed justice.

Echoing a scandal that befell Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam earlier this year, a photo depicting Trudeau in 'brownface' (he was reportedly dressed as an Arab for an 'Arabian Nights' theme party) was published by Time Magazine Wednesday evening.

The photo was taken in 2001 while Trudeau was teaching at an elite private school.

Photo Shows Justin Trudeau in Brownface at ‘Arabian Nights’ Party | Time https://t.co/LzDSPaGEiN
— David Cochrane (@CochraneCBC) September 18, 2019

The Liberal Party has already confirmed that Trudeau is in the photo, and the PM has already issued an apology - ""I am really sorry"" - to those who might be offended by the image, WSJ reports. Zita Astravas, spokeswoman for Trudeau's Liberal Party, confirmed it to Time.

Before...



...And after?



This couldn't have come at a worse time for Trudeau: His Liberal Party is neck-and-neck in the polls with their Conservative rivals ahead of what's expected to be a close federal election next month.

According to Time, the photo appeared in the 2000-2001 yearbook of West Point Grey Academy. The 'Arabian Nights'-themed gala was attended by students and faculty, Time reported. A Canadian businessman who was 'part of the WPGA community' came across the photo over the summer and decided that it should be made public.


The photograph has not been previously reported. The picture was taken at an “Arabian Nights”-themed gala. It shows Trudeau, then the 29-year-old son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, wearing a turban and robes with his face, neck and hands completely darkened. The photograph appears in the 2000-2001 yearbook of West Point Grey Academy, a private day school where Trudeau was a teacher.

Earlier this month, TIME obtained a copy of the yearbook, The View, with the photograph of Trudeau in brownface from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was part of the West Point Grey Academy community. Adamson was not at the party, which was attended by school faculty, administrators and parents of students. He said that he first saw the photograph in July and felt it should be made public.

The photo was taken while Trudeau taught classes, including French, at the school, which he left after the Spring of 2001. West Point Grey Academy is currently among the most expensive private day schools in Vancouver, with tuition ranging from just under $22,000 to about $23,500.

Several critics spoke out to WSJ saying it's 'deeply saddening' to see Trudeau in brownface/blackface. One of Trudeau's opponents is a Sikh, and as such blasted Trudeau and claimed personal offense.


“Seeing the Prime Minister in brownface/blackface is deeply saddening,” said Mustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims in a written statement. It is seeking an apology. “The wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism, slavery, and an Orientalist mythology that is unacceptable.""

Meanwhile, the leader of Canada’s left-wing New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, said the photo was insulting. Mr. Singh is a Sikh and wears a turban.

Of course, already one Twitter user and Trudeau critic has complained about being 'censored' by Twitter for trying to share the photo, which violates the site's terms of service.

14,zerohedge,Third Image Surfaces Of Trudeau Wearing 'Blackface,2019-09-19 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Following last night' revelation that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wore 'brownface' during a yearbook photo from a school he taught at until 2001,several other photos and video purporting to show the PM in 'black/brownface' have been unearthed by the press. The most recent to hit is a video showing what appears to be a high school-aged Trudeau wearing what looks like head to toe 'blackface' makeup.

During an apology released last night, Trudeau confessed that he had worn the 'makeup' on several other occasions, and that there might be other images,including snaps from a high school talent show where Trudeau sang Harry Belafonte's ""the Banana Boat Song (Day Oh)"" in blackface.

After the corruption scandal involving SNC-Lavalin broke, Trudeau's poll ratings slid, but they haven't moved much from lows they reached earlier this year.

Trudeau and his Liberal Party are still tied with the Conservatives,with 34% of the vote each, according to the latest poll (which, of course, took place before the scandal was made public).



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

As one twitter wit pointed out, Trudeau probably should have worked up a better strategy for getting this news in front of the public.


My big takeaway from the Justin Trudeau controversy: if you're the leader of a Western democracy who has starred in 50 or 60 minstrel shows, it's probably best to get that out before the media twists it all out of proportion
— David Burge (@iowahawkblog) September 19, 2019
The video, obtained exclusively by Global News shows Trudeau covered in what appears to be 'blackface' makeup raising his hands in the air while laughing, sticking his tongue out and making faces. He’s wearing a white T-shirt, and his jeans are ripped at the knees. The extremely childish display was made worse by the fact that Trudeau's limbs, including his arms and legs, are also covered in makeup.

The video doesn't appear to be have been shot at the same location as where the other photos were taken.






This is the third image of him to be verified by the Liberal Party's comms department.


The Liberal party referred Global News to his Wednesday night apology when asked about the new video.
Trudeau apologized Wednesday, saying that at the time, he didn’t think his actions were racist. Now, he said, he recognizes wearing brownface is racist and regrets his actions.

""I shouldn’t have done that,"" he said. ""I should have known better but I didn’t and I’m really sorry.""

Another photo has been produced of Trudeau in the 'Arabian Nights' getup that was reportedly found in an old school newspaper.



In the second photo, Trudeau has his arms around what appears to be two Sikh colleagues.

Then, of course, there's the original, where three lovely ladies are flanking Trudeau, who is apparently reveling in his status as the PM's son.

Then there was this image of Trudeau from his high school days.



NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an emotional statement after the first photo was made public, bashing Trudeau for his offensive comments.

Singh said it’s up to Canadians, not him, to decide whether Trudeau deserves forgiveness.

<p>The video, obtained exclusively by Global News shows Trudeau covered in what appears to be 'blackface' makeup raising his hands in the air while laughing, sticking his tongue out and making faces. He’s wearing a white T-shirt, and his jeans are ripped at the knees. The extremely childish display was made worse by the fact that Trudeau's limbs, including his arms and legs, are also covered in makeup.</p>

<p>The video doesn't appear to be have been shot at the same location as where the other photos were taken.</p>

<p>This is the third image of him to be verified by the Liberal Party's comms department.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Liberal party referred Global News to his Wednesday night apology when asked about the new video.<br>
Trudeau apologized Wednesday, saying that at the time, he didn’t think his actions were racist. <strong>Now, he said, he recognizes wearing brownface is racist and regrets his actions.</strong></p>

<p>""I shouldn’t have done that,"" he said. ""I should have known better but I didn’t and I’m really sorry.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another photo has been produced of Trudeau in the 'Arabian Nights' getup that was reportedly found in an old school newspaper.</p>

<p>NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an emotional statement after the first photo was made public, bashing Trudeau for his offensive comments.</p>

<p>Singh said it’s up to Canadians, not him, to decide whether Trudeau deserves forgiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>""I have to really point out what we’re seeing now is an ongoing pattern of behavior that’s really going to hurt Canadians,""</strong> he said. <strong>""They’re going to see the prime minister mocking the realities that so many Canadians live with.<u> And it is not a joke.""</u></strong></p>

15,zerohedge,CNN's Don Lemon Bashes Trump While Defending Trudeau After 'Brownface' Controversy,2019-09-19 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"CNN's Don Lemon clearly couldn't handle the news that broke late last night exposing his favorite Canadian leader for having worn 'brownface' in a yearbook picture.



The CNN anchor took a shot at President Trump Wednesday night, using Justin Trudeau's apology as an excuse to bash Trump. After mocking the president's aversion to apologizing, Lemon's CNN offered a strong defense of Trudeau.





googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Here's Trudeau's apology.


""I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,"" Trudeau told reporters. ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done that. I should've known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time but now I recognize that it was something racist to do and I'm deeply sorry.""

Lemon expressed his pleasant shock that a ""leader"" would apologize and knocked the U.S. leader in the process.


""Wow, a leader apologizing. It seems odd, doesn't it?"" Lemon reacted. ""Because we have one who doesn't.""

The CNN panel also offered a defense for Trudeau, with commentators stressing that ""context matters"" and stressed that Trudeau's photo was vastly different from Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's 1986 blackface photo.

Before wrapping the segment, Lemon offered more praise for Trudeau's 'heroic' apology (he's laying it on a bit thick here), and insisted that it ""does mean a lot"" to him.


""I do have to say this before we go: think about it however you want to think about it. When someone apologizes- wow!"" Lemon said to the panel. ""We don't often see that here, especially in a world leader who is saying 'I should've known better and I'm sorry.' You can feel about it however you want, but that, to me, that does mean a lot.""

Trudeau was scheduled to appear on YouTube star Lilly Singh's new show, but NBC confirmed that his scheduled appearance had been cancelled in the wake of the controversy. NBC added that it has no plans to invite him back to the show, ""A Little Late with Lilly Singh,"" which is the first on the network to be presented by a woman of color.

Trudeau had filmed a pre-recorded ""comedy clip"" and wished Singh, a Canadian-Indian star, ""good luck"" on Twitter ahead of the show's first episode, which was filmed on Monday.

12,zerohedge,CNN's Don Lemon Discovers True Problem In Justin Trudeau Blackface Scandal – Trump,2019-09-20 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Rusty Weiss via The Mental Recession

CNN anchor Don Lemon has found what he considers to be the true angle on the Justin Trudeau blackface scandal – that President Trump is a bad man.



Orange man bad, as they say.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Trudeau was featured in a 2001 photo from a Time magazine report dressed in brownface makeup for an “Arabian Nights” party held at the private school in which he taught.

He was apologetic about the whole affair.

“I shouldn’t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn’t and I’m really sorry,” Trudeau said. “I take responsibility for my decision to do that.”

“I shouldn’t have done that. I should’ve known better. It was something that I didn’t think was racist at the time but now I recognize that it was something racist to do and I’m deeply sorry.”


Prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau wore blackface at 2001 costume party. He'll say he's sorry, & liberals will forget it ever happened.

Just like they did with Ralph Northam, Jimmy Kimmel, Howard Stern, & Robert Downey Jr.

But if a conservative did it, they'd be ruined. pic.twitter.com/ojim3V59nj

Imagine this was an image of President Trump. And imagine he apologized for doing something stupid in his past. Do you think Lemon, or anybody in the media for that matter, would be forgiving?

To nobody’s surprise, Lemon’s fellow beta male in Trudeau was praised for his apology. Not only did he praise Trudeau, but Lemon took a shot at Trump over a scandal that has absolutely nothing to do with him!

“Wow, a leader apologizing. It seems odd, doesn’t it?” Lemon said following a clip of Trudeau’s statement. “Because we have one who doesn’t.”

Nice leap in logic there, Don. Is it any wonder the President has repeatedly labeled Lemon the “dumbest man on television”?

The CNN ‘journalist’ fawned over Trudeau’s apology to end the segment as well.

“I do have to say this before we go: think about it however you want to think about it. When someone apologizes- wow!” Lemon gushed. “We don’t often see that here, especially in a world leader who is saying ‘I should’ve known better and I’m sorry.’ You can feel about it however you want, but that, to me, that does mean a lot.”

Wow Don Lemon is outraged about Justin Trudeau wearing brownface

Again, no amount of apology from a Republican would ever suffice in Lemon’s world. But liberals who do this – perfectly okay. That’s why you can have a Ralph Northam or Justin Trudeau blackface scandal and both men can emerge unscathed.

10,zerohedge,"Canada's ""Wokest"" PM Just Took A Hit In The Polls After Blackface Scandal",2019-09-21 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"It wasn't a good week for Canada's ""wokest"" leader, Justin Trudeau, after multiple images of the Liberal Party Prime Minister in 'brownface' and 'blackface' emerged. If the images from a 2001 ""Arabian Nights"" party released Wednesday weren't bad enough, a follow-up video showing a separate third blackface incident released soon after his public apology made things even worse, taking the cringe level higher.

Two major polls published Saturday show that during the days encompassing the scandal emerging, Canada’s Liberal Party took a hit, however a modest one, in what could be a sign of more significant slipping to come.



Reuters reports of the two polls' results, less than five weeks ahead of the country's Oct. 21 federal election:


googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });


Conservative leader Andrew Scheer had a 4.8 percentage-point lead against Trudeau, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Saturday for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper. Scheer had a 3.2 percentage-point lead in the previous survey published on Friday.

Conservatives would win 36.8% of the vote and the Liberals 32%, the poll said...

The Nanos poll was conducted over three nights until Sept. 20. The first image of Trudeau in blackface at a 2001 “Arabian Nights” party when he was a 29-year-old teacher emerged on the evening of Sept. 18.

And of the second poll, Reuters summarizes:

The Liberals were leading in a Mainstreet poll published by iPolitics on Saturday, but hadlost 0.4 percentage point from the previous survey compared with a 0.2 percentage-point slide by the Conservatives.

The Mainstreet poll, conducted between Sept. 17 and 19, had the Liberals at 36.8% compared with 34.2% for the Conservatives.

Scheer, Trudeau's Conservative rival vying to replace him as PM, has been in a statistical tie with the incumbent in most polls taken for the past few months, but got the noticeable bump just as the images surfaced.

Meanwhile the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Green Party are pouncing, and can now more easily hit Trudeau from the left, pealing off additional valuable liberal votes.

Dear @JustinTrudeau, now there’s a video.

How can we trust you to fight for racial equity in housing & employment, racial justice in schools & our immigration system?

<blockquote>
<p>Conservative leader <strong>Andrew Scheer had a 4.8 percentage-point lead against Trudeau</strong>, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Saturday for CTV and the Globe and Mail newspaper. <strong>Scheer had a 3.2 percentage-point lead in the previous survey published on Friday</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Conservatives would win 36.8% of the vote and the Liberals 32%, the poll said</strong>...</p>

<p>The Nanos poll was conducted over three nights until Sept. 20. The first image of Trudeau in blackface at a 2001 “Arabian Nights” party when he was a 29-year-old teacher emerged on the evening of Sept. 18.</p>

<p>And of the second poll, Reuters <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-election-poll/canadas-trudeau-loses-a-little-ground-in-first-polls-since-blackface-scandal-idUSKBN1W60J7"">summarizes</a>:</p>

<p>The Liberals were leading in a Mainstreet poll published by iPolitics on Saturday, but had<strong> lost 0.4 percentage point from the previous survey compared with a 0.2 percentage-point slide by the Conservatives</strong>.</p>

<p>The Mainstreet poll, conducted between Sept. 17 and 19, had the Liberals at 36.8% compared with 34.2% for the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Scheer, Trudeau's&nbsp;Conservative rival vying to replace him as PM,&nbsp;has been in a statistical tie with the incumbent in most polls taken for the past few months, but got the noticeable bump just as the images surfaced.&nbsp;</p>

In that spirit, the PM has decided to skip a debate on foreign policy with his rivals, prompting the organizer, Munk Debates, to cancel the event.

The chairman of the organization sponsoring the Munk debates, Rudyard Griffiths, told the Globe and Mail that the debate was cancelled because of Trudeau's refusal, seeing as he would be the only one on stage with any foreign policy experience.


""It’s really unfortunate that Canadians are not going to have a standalone debate on foreign policy this election cycle,"" Mr. Griffiths said.

It's not difficult to imagine how Trudeau's rivals might use a debate about foreign policy to attack Trudeau about his 'blackface' scandal. At this point, any events that aren't also tightly controlled by Trudeau and his campaign probably won't happen as Trudeau and his party struggle to regain their lead in the polls with only weeks...to go until election day.

Instead, Trudeau will participate in two televised debates organized by a government commission(established by Trudeau's Liberal government, so there's a good chance he might be able to see some questions in advance) - one in English, and one in French - as well as another debate hosted by French-language network TVA.

It's truly unfortunate that Trudeau forced the cancellation of the foreign policy debate. Because if there was ever an election where foreign policy was relevant to the lives of Canadians, this is it.


""With everything that’s going on the world, if there ever was a moment, if there ever was a time, to really focus on the competing foreign-policy platforms of the various parties contending for government, now is that moment.""

Griffin also criticized the 'commission' that will organize two of the debates, saying it has become a tool for actually adopted were the PM to avoid real scrutiny.


""It seems like the commission has become a vehicle for an incumbent prime minister to actually avoid other debates and that it’s actually working against this whole process of opening the election,"" he said.

The publication has gotten hold of a previously unreleased high-quality video of Trudeau's third blackface incident, after a grainy and very brief version had been first released by Global News.

“It was a costume day for river guides on the whitewater rafting operation that I worked at in the summer between ‘92 and ’94, roughly,” Trudeau had admitted apologetically over a week ago after the brief, grainy clip had initially surfaced. From the full context and close-up of the new higher quality video, it's evident that Trudeau, who would have been between 21 and 23 years old at the time, was the only one on the trip wearing the offensive 'blackface' make-up, along with an afro wig and what appears to be a shirt with toucans on it (when the grainier first version surfaced, there was some debate over whether bananas were printed on the shirt).


Wow he really committed to the getup. He even wore a wig.

A young Trudeau is seen just after the 40-second mark in the rafting trip video montage in full blackface, with the make-up covering his legs as well, making gestures toward the camera and sticking out his tongue.

Over the weekend the Toronto Star put up the high-quality video, but then without explanation set it to 'private' - removing it from public view, only leaving the still frame picture.

Of course, it quickly appeared on social media thereafter. Following pressure from other outlets, the video was set to public again. ""After seven hours, the Star has finally made the video available to the public,"" Canada's The Post Millennial reported.

— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) September 28, 2019
As The Sun explains further, it's the first video to show the full context of one of the three incidents which surfaced earlier this month, but the fuller version certainly makes it worse, considering he's ""the only one who dons blackface and afro"" among the many people filmed on the trip:

A previous blurry image from this moment was widely circulated, but now a high-quality video showing Mr Trudeau has come out.

In the full clip, pals are white water rafting and kayaking during the day before a fancy dress party.

Mr Trudeau is the only one who dons a blackface and afro as he cheekily sticks his tongue out for the camera.

The clip shows he even went as far as to paint his knees and his tongue black.

But this was not a one-off for the holier-than-thou politician, who is known for calling others out for racism.

As multiple publications have highlighted, now only weeks out from Canada's federal elections, Trudeau quickly pivoted away from the controversy after issuing a brief apology, first proposing a ban on military-style assault rifles, and this past week joining climate change protests.



His lame attempt at dramatic political distraction controversial arms restriction proposal also seeks to give cities the power to ban handguns. This is as there's clear evidence suggesting he and his Liberal Party are slipping in the polls in the wake of the blackface scandal.

7,zerohedge,Drastic Climate Action Needed Now... Let's Ban Private Jets,2019-10-04 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Authored by Mark Jeftovic via Guerilla-Capitalism.com,

As the din of climate hysteria grows ever louder, the eco-pious and super-rich call for immediate and drastic action on climate change. Justin Trudeau, still licking his wounds from being outed for his multiple episodes of blackface and brownface, took more heat today as he’s criss-crossing the country ahead of the forthcoming federal election with not one, but two private jets.



Calls for immediate climate action are accelerating, in fact we’ve seen numerous trial balloons floated from a complicit mainsteam media (or as Canada’a reigning Liberals call it “Approved Media”).



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

These trial balloons / admonitions include:
Eating less meat, or no meat, or perhaps eat maggots or eat people, to reduce carbon output.


Driving less, fewer cars on the road, ban on gas powered vehicles, to reduce carbon output.


Have less children, or no children, to reduce carbon output.


And of course:
Fly less. Let’s have fewer planes in the air, to reduce carbon output.


These guidelines are understandably hard sells for Joe Public, as many common people like to eat meat, or need a car to get to-and-from work, and children, as demanding as they can be, eventually grow up and can mow our lawns and do chores around the house.

So if we’re serious about drastic climate action, right now, before the world ends, we need to do something that has maximum bang for the buck, while disrupting as few lives as possible. This way, the rabble masses will see that our leaders and elites are serious and they have the will to take whatever action necessary to make this happen.

#BanPrivateJets

The top 50 countries in the world in terms of private jet ownership have a total fleet of nearly 18,000 jets. According to Statista, private jet ownership is soaring in most countries (as wealth inequality accelerates thanks to central bank interventions and 10 years of Cantillon Effects).



According to The Independent, the most popular private jet is the Cessna Citation XLS, which I believe climate alarmist Leonardo Di Caprio may be boarding in the picture below, having been shunted to the runway via a private helicopter…



A Cessna Citation XLS burns approximately 6,030kg of CO2 per three hour flight.

It’s back-of-the-napkin, but let’s say a typical jet does 4 legs per week, at 3 hour legs. We get:

17,947 jets X 6,030 kg CO2/flight X 4 flights/week X 52 weeks = 22,509,845,280 kilograms of Co2.

Over 22 billion kilos of C02. Per year.

But if we banned private jets, with immediate effect, no exceptions, very few working class and middle class people would be affected. In fact even upper class, low-tier wealthy would be unaffected, it would only affect the tiny sliver at the top of the wealth pyramid, the same ones who seem most vociferously adamant on drastic climate action now and who could best afford to make alternate arrangements for attending climate summits or other important events. Davos could be held via Skype, for example.

Taking the important step now will set the tone for the coming, rapid and drastic restructuring of every aspect of our lives, and it will be an easier pill to swallow when the elitists driving this change are leading the charge by example. Be the change you wish to see! #BanPrivateJets

<p>It’s back-of-the-napkin, but let’s say a typical jet does 4 legs per week, at 3 hour legs. We get:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>17,947 jets X&nbsp; 6,030 kg CO2/flight X 4 flights/week&nbsp; X 52 weeks =&nbsp;<strong>22,509,845,280 kilograms of Co2</strong>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Over 22 billion kilos of C02. Per year.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if we banned private jets, with immediate effect, no exceptions, <strong>very few working class and middle class people would be affected.</strong> In fact even upper class, low-tier wealthy would be unaffected, it would only affect the tiny sliver at the top of the wealth pyramid, the same ones who seem most vociferously adamant on&nbsp;<strong>drastic climate action now</strong>&nbsp;and who could best afford to make alternate arrangements for attending climate summits or other important events. Davos could be held via Skype, for example.</p>

<p>Taking the important step now will set the tone for the coming, rapid and drastic restructuring of every aspect of our lives, and it will be an easier pill to swallow when the elitists driving this change are leading the charge by example. Be the change you wish to see!&nbsp;<strong>#BanPrivateJets</strong></p>

But there might be another scandal in the works. According to a report in the Buffalo Chronicle, the party is doing everything in its power to suppress a sex scandal involving Trudeau and the daughter of a wealthy Canadian businessman who Trudeau reportedly may have become involved with when she was a student at West Point Grey Academy, a prestigious private school where Trudeau worked as a substitute teacher in his 20s.

The Chronicle's sources claim that political observers had been anticipating an expose in Saturday's Globe and Mail. However, it appears Trudeau and his people have gotten to the woman, and are in the process of negotiating an NDA. The woman is being represented by counsel, and is reportedly being offered monetary compensation.

Trudeau worked as a substitute teacher at the private school from 1999 until an abrupt departure in June 2001. It has long been rumored that Trudeau had improper relations with female students while working at the school, though nothing has ever been substantiated.

5,zerohedge,The Little Canadian Oil Town Ravaged By Big Insolvencies,2019-10-13 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"Fort McMurray, Alberta has officially turned into ""the insolvency capital of Canada"", according to Bloomberg.

The small oil town's problems are exemplified by the number of people who show up every month at the Wood Buffalo Food Bank. A decade ago, the bank would see about 2,000 people per month, coming by for cans of soup and jars of peanut butter. Now, that number stands closer to 8,000 people per month. Many that come by now are men and women who were ""living high before the bust.""



The Food Bank's director, Dan Edwards, said: “You never know who’s going to walk through your door. Individuals that have degrees and education and skills—but the jobs just aren’t what they were.”



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

The tiny city of just 75,000 exemplifies the debt problems that are spreading across Canada. As large paychecks and robust overtime have dried up, the bill for many consumers' spending over the last decade has finally come due.



In the Fort McMurray district, consumer insolvency filings were up 39% in 2018, the largest increase in Canada. Claims against property have been up about tenfold in the last three years. The 90 day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans in the city is up 1.75% in the second quarter, compared to 1.12% nationally.

The main driver of the bust has been the five year slump in oil prices, which have halved since 2014. Exacerbating things was a ""crippling shortage"" of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a reserve of crude-laden oil sands. Plans for new lines have been held up in court or by activists, including U.S. activists who have called the oil sands a ""carbon bomb"".



The energy industry continues to be a key part of Canada's upcoming federal election. Conservatives argue they are champions of the sector and argue they will undo many regulations implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Liberals are working to try and strike a balance between developing the industry, while committing to combating climate change.



Steve Richardson is a prime example of the area. After working at Suncorp for 5 years, he was let go in May. He had formerly earned 6 figures as a machine operator and would commute from Vancouver, working 14 days on and then 7 days off. Once travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family closer to the job. But now, he's being forced to cut back across the board - including cutting things like his cable bill.

Richardson said: “I spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be. I never got into all the toys. I’m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn’t have to sell everything off like some other people. I’ve seen a lot of that. It’s like a fire sale.”



The potential in the area remains immense.

The Alberta oil sands are the third largest proven reserve in the world, only behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg notes that ""As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested C$210.1 billion ($157.7 billion), more than last year’s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.""

Output over those 10 years doubled and Canada became the world's fifth largest oil producer, up from eighth.

During the boom, the city's population doubled, tax revenue helped revamp the airport and schools, and median household incomes more than doubled between 2001 and 2011, to about C$181,000.

When oil tanked, plans stalled, companies like Shell and ConocoPhillips sold their oil-sand assets and capital investments declined. Capital investments are currently on track to decline for a fifth straight year to about C$12 billion, down by about 66% since 2014.

To make matters far worse, when oil was at $26, a wildfire swept through the area and forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people. It caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses.

Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said: “The housing market is down, there’s the economic downturn and there’s still the recovery from the fire.”

<p><strong>In the Fort McMurray district, consumer insolvency filings were up 39% in 2018, the largest increase in Canada.</strong> Claims against property have been up about tenfold in the last three years. The 90 day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans in the city is up 1.75% in the second quarter, compared to 1.12% nationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main driver of the bust has been the five year slump in oil prices, which have halved since 2014. <strong>Exacerbating things was a ""crippling shortage"" of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation</strong>, a reserve of crude-laden oil sands. Plans for new lines have been held up in court or by activists, including U.S. activists who have called the oil sands a ""carbon bomb"".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Richardson is a prime example of the area. After working at Suncorp for 5 years, he was let go in May. He had formerly earned 6 figures as a machine operator and would commute from Vancouver, working 14 days on and then 7 days off. Once travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family closer to the job. But now, he's being forced to cut back across the board - including cutting things like his cable bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Richardson said:&nbsp;<strong>“I spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be. I never got into all the toys. I’m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn’t have to sell everything off like some other people. I’ve seen a lot of that. It’s like a fire sale.”</strong></p>

<p>The potential in the area remains immense.</p>

<p>The Alberta oil sands are the third largest proven reserve in the world, only behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg notes that ""As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested C$210.1 billion ($157.7 billion), more than last year’s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.""</p>

<p>Output over those 10 years doubled and Canada became the world's fifth largest oil producer, up from eighth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the boom, the city's population doubled, tax revenue helped revamp the airport and schools, and median household incomes more than doubled between 2001 and 2011, to about C$181,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When oil tanked, plans stalled, companies like Shell and ConocoPhillips sold their oil-sand assets and capital investments declined. Capital investments are currently on track to decline for a fifth straight year to about C$12 billion, down by about 66% since 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To make matters far worse, when oil was at $26, a wildfire swept through the area and forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people. It caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said: “The housing market is down, there’s the economic downturn&nbsp;and there’s still the recovery from the fire.”</p>

I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.

Meddling much?



If Obama's support helps Trudeau with this marginal voter, he should win a second term, albeit with a weakened mandate. If he doesn’t, he’ll go down as a one-term wonder, allowing little-known Andrew Scheer to become the next prime minister.

According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.’s aggregate poll averages, 54% of Canadians disapprove of his performance with an approval rating of just 31%.

Most notably, however, Obama endorsing a white guy who mocked black people by dressing up in back-face (numerous times) seems stunningly hypocritical... especially given his lack of endorsement of Joe Biden (or any of the current US Democratic field).

<p>If Obama's support helps Trudeau with this marginal voter, he should win a second term, albeit with a weakened mandate. If he doesn’t, he’ll go down as a one-term wonder, allowing little-known Andrew Scheer to become the next prime minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.’s&nbsp;aggregate poll averages, <strong>54% of Canadians disapprove of his performance with an approval rating of just 31%</strong>.</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong.

<p>Most notably, however, Obama endorsing a white guy who mocked black people by dressing up in back-face (numerous times) seems stunningly hypocritical... especially given his lack of endorsement of Joe Biden (or any of the current US Democratic field).</p>

47,zerohedge,Trudeau Approval Hits All Time Low As Canadians Prepare To Vote,2019-10-19 09:55:00,Tyler Durden,,"By Steve Crabtree



Canadians will vote to elect members of the federal House of Commons next Monday, amid a climate of ambivalence about their current leadership. Support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fallen sharply since 2016, his first full year in office, when nearly three in four (72%) said they approved of the way he is handling his job as prime minister. In 2019, for the first time, Canadians are more likely to say they disapprove (52%) than to say they approve (46%) of Trudeau's job performance.





googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Trudeau's recent tenure has been marred by scandal, including a recent ruling that his administration violated ethics rules in pressuring the country's attorney general to intervene in a criminal case involving a Quebec-based construction company. Trudeau himself also faced intense criticism after videos and photos surfaced of him wearing blackface and brownface at parties in the early 1990s and 2000s.

However, Canadians' growing misgivings apply more broadly than just to views of the prime minister himself, and are reflected in declining satisfaction with high-profile election issues such as environmental stewardship and economic wellbeing. Asked more generally about their approval of the country's leadership, just 49% say they approve in 2019, down from 64% in 2016.



Canadians' Satisfaction With Efforts to Preserve Environment Hits New Low

This year's election campaigns have placed considerable focus on questions about how to balance environmental concerns with economic growth. Trudeau's Liberal government took power in October 2015, touting a plan to dramatically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions with a federal carbon tax imposed on provinces that did not already have one or did not meet federal emissions standards.

Canadians' satisfaction with efforts to preserve the environment improved in the two years after Trudeau's election; in 2017, about two-thirds (65%) were satisfied. However, the prime minister's carbon tax program has been bogged down by political infighting and concerns that heavily coal-dependent provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan will suffer too much economically. Though a federal carbon-pricing program finally took effect in early 2019, Canadians are no longer as optimistic about the country's environmental policy; 50% now say they are satisfied with efforts to preserve the environment, while a similar 49% are dissatisfied.



Candidates in this year's elections have also been challenged to balance their rhetoric about environmental policy with attention to ""pocketbook"" issues of concern to many Canadians. The proportion of adults who say their standard of living is improving has fallen 10 percentage points to 52% in the past two years -- a finding that reflects a recent Ipsos survey showing that, despite the country's strong macroeconomic numbers, many Canadians currently express uncertainty about their personal economic situation.



Implications

Canadians' waning satisfaction with regard to both environmental efforts and their personal economic situation -- two key election issues -- help explain why Trudeau's Liberal Party has been losing ground to the Conservative Party as the vote approaches. Whichever party emerges as the winner will face the considerable challenge of helping more Canadians feel the benefits of the country's economic tail wind, while shoring up confidence in the government's ability to implement sound environmental policy","<div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"" property=""schema:text""><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""oop"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('oop'); });</script></aside></div><p><em>By Steve Crabtree</em></p>

<p>Candidates in this year's elections have also been challenged to balance their rhetoric about environmental policy with attention to ""pocketbook"" issues of concern to many Canadians. The proportion of adults who say their standard of living is improving has fallen 10 percentage points to 52% in the past two years -- a finding that reflects a recent Ipsos survey showing that, despite the country's strong macroeconomic numbers, many Canadians currently express uncertainty about their personal economic situation.</p>

<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>

<p>Canadians' waning satisfaction with regard to both environmental efforts and their personal economic situation -- two key election issues -- help explain why Trudeau's Liberal Party has been losing ground to the Conservative Party as the vote approaches. Whichever party emerges as the winner will face the considerable challenge of helping more Canadians feel the benefits of the country's economic tail wind, while shoring up confidence in the government's ability to implement sound environmental policy.</p>

3,zerohedge,Futures Rebound From Overnight Swoon On Strong Earnings As Key Brexit Votes Loom,2019-10-22 00:00:00,Tyler Durden,,"After spiking higher in the early overnight session for no obvious reason besides a largish buy order in an increasingly illiquid market, US equity futures faded most of their gains during the Asian session despite some renewed ""trade deal optimism"" after China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that China and the United States have achieved some progress in their trade talks, before recovering much of their losses after the European open, and pushing modestly higher following strong earnings from P&G, UPS and UTX which helped push future above the flatline.



It’s a huge week for corporate earnings, with around one-fifth of S&P 500 members due to report, including McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble on Tuesday followed by Microsoft and Caterpillar a day later. So far results have generally surprised to the upside, although estimates have declined sharply in recent week. Despite the beats, analysts are still cutting estimates for next year as the protectionist dispute between the world’s biggest economies continues to take a toll.

Futures closely tracked European markets which saw a flurry of company results including UBS profit beating estimates as the Swiss lender said it will book a roughly $100 million charge in the fourth quarter to restructure a unit. Helping European markets, drugmaker Novartis raised its earnings forecast for the third time this year. The European banking sector was off its best levels, however, with gains in tech and real estate names offset by losses in household, travels and construction.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });



Earlier in the session, Asian stocks climbed for a second day, led by health-care firms, amid rising hopes that China-U.S. trade talks will progress toward an agreement. Most markets in the region were up, with South Korea - seen as a proxy for global trade - leading gains. Japan was closed for the Imperial Enthronement day. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.5% higher after erasing earlier losses, with Foxconn Industrial Internet and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China among the biggest boosts. China’s central bank used open-market operations to inject the largest amount of cash into the banking system since May, as upcoming corporate tax payments tighten liquidity conditions.



India’s Sensex fell 0.7%, snapping a six-day winning streak, as Infosys plunged following a whistle-blower complaint alleging irregular accounting at the software exporter. Infosys sank as much as 16%, weighing heavily on the gauge and more than offsetting post-earning gains in HDFC Bank Ltd. and Reliance Industries.

President Donald Trump stoked hopes that a trade deal can be reached next month, saying that China has indicated negotiations are advancing and has started buying more American agricultural products. ""There are still residual concerns about the outlook as we head toward Christmas with memories of last year’s price capitulation still fresh,"" said strategist Greg McKenna. ""But earnings so far aren’t as bad -- or should I say much worse -- than thought. And there is still much cash on the sidelines, and the increase in bond yields is mildly supportive of stocks.""

Eurozone government bonds yields fell on Tuesday, before a critical vote in British parliament crucial to determining whether the UK can leave the European Union in an orderly way on Oct 31. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two Brexit votes in the British parliament on Tuesday. Lawmakers will first vote on a Withdrawal Agreement Bill and then on the government’s timetable for approving the legislation.

“It’s too close to call whether there will be a majority,” said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz. “This may be also very much reflected by market developments, that you don’t see major movement to one or the other side.” Johnson probably has the votes to pass the withdrawal bill but may struggle to pass his timetable on Tuesday, the BBC’s political editor said.

Ten-year government bond yields across the euro zone were down 2 basis point on the day. Germany’s 10-year yield was at -0.36%, bull flattening with German 30y yields 4.5bps lower. Analysts said much of the optimism around Brexit is already priced in and expect subdued reactions. Euro zone government bonds sold off as the first signs of a Brexit deal emerged; the German 10-year bond yield has risen 19 bps since Oct. 10.

“The market is pricing a lot of optimism, a) on the no-deal Brexit being taken off the table tonight, b) on the deal being approved tonight. Therefore, there’s not much room for rates to move higher,” said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.

As one would expect, overnight volatility in sterling remained elevated as traders position ahead of the Second Reading vote, with cable drifting below the key 1.300 level.



In other FX markets, the dollar caught a bid with EURUSD trading around Monday’s lows, CNH is offered above 7.0800, while Canada's Loonie traded flat after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in elections, though with a reduced mandate. The shekel strengthened after Benjamin Netanyahu again failed to form a government in Israel.

Elsewhere, Italian government bonds outperformed, the 10-year yield falling 6 basis points to 1.03%. “Think of BTPs at the moment as being bunds with greater volatility. So when the bund market sells off, BTPs tend to sell off more,” ING’s Bouvet said. The European Commission has sent a letter to Italian authorities, asking for clarification over their 2020 draft budgets. Rome will reply by Wednesday. That said, a major conflict is not expected, unlike last year when the Commission sent back Italy’s draft budget and asked for a new one, sparking a surge in Italian yields. Italy’s draft 2020 budget assumes a rise in its structural deficit of 0.1% of GDP. Under EU rules, it should fall to 0.6% of GDP. A successful sale of BTP Italia inflation-linked bonds to retail investors also supported Italian bonds

In commodities, crude futures popped higher off the Asian lows back into the green. Mixed trade in metals, LME tin drops 0.6. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. WTI prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its Brent counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020.

In geopolitics, Turkey President Erdogan vowed to go ahead with its Syria offensive ""more strongly"" if the US ""breaks its promises"". Further, Kurdish YPG Militia are to initially withdraw from the 120km strip of border with Turkey in Northeastern Syria, according to Turkish Security Forces sources.

Looking at the day ahead, as well as the beginning of the debate in the House of Commons on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, earnings season picks up again, with releases including UBS Group, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, Novartis, Texas Instruments and United Technologies. In terms of data releases, we have UK public sector net borrowing for September, Canada’s retail sales for August, and in the US there’s September’s existing home sales and October’s Richmond Fed manufacturing index. Finally, the Hungarian central bank will be deciding on rates.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) was positive with the index propped up by strength in the commodity-related sectors aside from gold miners after the precious metal trickled further below the USD 1500/oz level, while corporate updates also provided a catalyst. Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were mixed despite a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which conducted CNY 250bln of 7-day reverse repos for its largest daily net injection in nearly 5 months, with the mainland choppy ahead of upcoming earnings and with Hong Kong anticipating the announcement of further supportive measures for companies later today.

Major European bourses are choppy (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.1%) albeit, the region drifted back into positive territory following initially losses seen at the open. Constructive reports on the EU/China trade during the early EU session ultimately did little to shift the sentiment at the time. In terms of sectors, the picture is mixed; with Consumer Staples (-0.5%) and Health Care (-0.2%) propping up and Tech (+0.4%) and Energy (+1.0%) topping the performance table. In terms of individual mover; Just Eat (+24.7%) shares spiked higher on the news that Prosus NV had made a cash offer for the Co, valuing it at GBP 4.9bln, or GBP 7.10 per share, Just Eat has since rejected the offer stating that it significantly undervalues the Co. in combination with Takeaway.com. Novartis (+0.1%) opened higher after the Co. raised net sales guidance but gave away gains in-line with the market-wide decline. UBS (+1.6%), SAAB (+5.4%), Software AG (+9.3%) and Sunrise Communications (+2.5%) were also beneficiaries of strong earnings reports. Conversely, weak earnings from AMS (+0.2%), Thales (-2.2%) and Reckitt Benckiser (-3.3%) saw their respective share prices under pressure. In terms of broker moves, a downgrade for TUI (-5.7%) at Morgan Stanley saw the Co.’s shares sell off.

In FX, the USD is on a firmer footing, almost across the G10 board, with the DXY edging higher after testing support ahead of 97.000 yesterday and the index regains momentum to probe above 97.400 within a 97.440-259 range. However, the recovery looks largely due to declines in rival currencies rather than self-generated, as the Franc retreats further from recent peaks and Pound succumbs to a bout of more pronounced pre-UK Parliament vote jitters.
NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is off best levels, but still outperforming and maintaining a bullish bias while holding above 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and having breached 1.0700 against the Aussie. Conversely, Aud/Usd continues to fade ahead of 0.6900 even though news on US-China trade has been mainly constructive of late amidst signs of the pair reaching overbought levels and a decent option expiry at 0.6850 (850 mn) may also be weighing. Back to the Nzd, trade data looms and may provide some fundamental impetus, while the Aud could be prone to comments from RBA Deputy Governor Kent also due later.
CHF/GBP - The major laggards as noted above, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9900 and Cable retreating further from Monday’s 1.3000+ peaks in the run up to the WAB 2nd reading in the HoC that could set-off a chain of further votes and an extremely compressed timetable to get Brexit legislation in place for October 31. The Pound is holding above 1.2900 and managing to contain its pullback vs the Euro to circa 20 pips below 0.8600, as the single currency also fades against the Dollar.
JPY/CAD/EUR - All narrowly mixed compared to the Buck, as the Yen meanders between 108.50-75, Loonie sustains gains within 1.3100-1.3070 parameters after the Canadian election and bulk of votes indicating that PM Trudeau is heading for a return to office with his Liberal Party, but also conscious that retail sales and the Q3 BoC business/loan survey are on tap and could impact. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd remains capped ahead of 1.1200 and has tested the 100 DMA (1.1136), but not convincingly.
EM - Although the Dollar has pared some losses vs G10 peers and the Yuan has eased from recent highs, several regional currencies are staging comebacks of their own, like the Rand and even the Lira despite the impending end of the ceasefire and ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his Russian counterpart.

In commodities, WTI and Brent futures are choppy but ultimately in the green. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. WTI prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its Brent counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020. For reference, the firm’s demand forecasts are modestly higher than that of the EIA, IEA and OPEC. Looking ahead, trader will be eyeing the weekly API crude data, but before that over in the UK, the vote on the 2nd reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may prompt some sentiment-driven action. Elsewhere, gold prices remain firmer sub-1500/oz despite a bounce back in Dollar as participants could be hedging ahead of upcoming risk events, and with US-China also still on the radar. Meanwhile, Copper prices are on the backfoot today, mostly due to the indecisive risk sentiment coupled with a firmer Buck with prices back below 2.65/lb ahead of its 100 DMA at 2.63/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures rose in excess of 1.2% at one point as the base metal was bouyed by continued supply woes after Vale halted a tailing dam earlier this month followed by downgrades in FY iron ore and pellet sales guidance.

DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

I appreciate that the UK population is only 0.9% of the world’s total and that there are perhaps more important things for global markets in the greater scheme of things than Brexit but you only have to look at the selloff in 10yr bunds since the bilateral meeting between Varadkar and Johnson (+20.5bps) two weeks ago to see the impact that a no deal risk has had on markets. Famous last words but we should know a lot more by the end of today as to whether the U.K. will leave the EU by the end of next week (or soon after). As expected the government were refused the opportunity for a meaningful vote last night for reasons explained yesterday but they are pressing on with the Withdrawal Agreement Bill today, the text of which was published by the government last night. The timetable will be intense and perhaps one risk is that MPs feel like they are being rushed into it and don’t vote for a bill that they might have otherwise have done. The Government want to have it pass the House of Commons by Thursday (with midnight sittings) before going to the House of Lords on Friday in order to try to deliver Brexit by October 31st (next Thursday). There is a vote today on this timetable (7:15 pm London time) and that could be a big test for the government’s strategy. Before this, the government is likely to hold what’s known as the Second Reading vote at around 7 pm (London time)-- on whether Parliament agrees with the general principles of the bill. Sources this morning suggest Labour will abstain on this which would mean this vote will go through. If true Labour will use the amendments to create difficulties for the government.

We’ve copied the timetable below. Losing the Program Motion vote, which sets the timetable for the rest of debate, would simply make it very hard to hit the deadlines.

Tuesday
12.30 p.m.Second Reading debate starts
7 p.m.Vote on Second Reading - the general principle of the bill
7.15 p.m.Vote on Program Motion - the timetable for the rest of the bill’s passage
7.30 p.m.(If Program Motion passes) Committee Stage begins
10.30 p.m.First Committee Stage votes

Even if the Program Motion passes, the passage of this legislation is also likely to be fraught, as opponents of the Brexit deal have already said that they’ll seek to amend the legislation as it passes through the Committee stage. As we discussed yesterday, likely amendments to watch out for will be those calling for a second referendum and another seeking a customs union. Labour’s shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has also said that Labour would seek to avoid the possibility that at the end of the transition, the UK could simply revert to a no-deal scenario if no free-trade agreement has been reached with the EU. On Sunday it looked like momentum was building towards a customs union membership amendment passing. However the DUP seemed to indicate yesterday that they wouldn’t support it and a number of MPs who have previously supported it in indicative votes suggested they wouldn’t this time. Much might depend on the SNP and Lib Dems whose policy is to stop Brexit and therefore would only vote for it to bide time and complicate the government’s task. They may do so. The government have hinted they would withdraw the bill if such an amendment passes and we could soon be in caretaker government / imminent election territory. A second referendum amendment is not likely to pass according to those journalists close to the action but the Customs Union one is closer depending on the above.

Sterling was relatively strong yesterday as the dip was quite rightly bought, given the balance of risks, climbing above $1.30 in trading for the first time since May 13 yesterday. It ended up finishing -0.16% at $1.296, though that was +0.66% off its earlier lows from the open. Its trading up +0.16% this morning at $1.2981.

Amidst the political developments, equity markets advanced yesterday as optimism over the Brexit saga and positive noises on trade boosted sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. The S&P 500 closed up +0.69% to reach its highest level in a month, leaving the index shy of just a +0.64% rise from its all-time high back in July. The NASDAQ (+0.91%) also advanced, although the Dow Jones was up just +0.21% thanks to Boeing, which fell -3.76% yesterday ahead of its earnings release. The energy sector led sectoral gains, closing +1.86% higher, led by Halliburton (+6.35%) after a strong earnings report. The company announced plans to expand more aggressively overseas, while simultaneously limiting costs in the US. The positive earnings momentum outweighed the fall in oil prices, with Brent down -0.62%.

Meanwhile in Europe, the STOXX 600 (+0.61%), the DAX (+1.0x%) and the FTSE MIB (+0.91%) all climbed to their highest levels in over a year. It was the reverse picture in bond markets, with sovereign bonds losing ground and curves steepening in both the US and Europe. 10yr Treasuries ended the day +4.7bps, while the 2s10s curve steepened +0.2bps to its highest level since July. Bund yields climbed +3.8bps to -0.344%, also its highest level since July, while OATs (+3.3bps), BTPs (+5.8bps) and Gilts (+4.1bps) also suffered losses. Banks were the beneficiaries however, with the S&P 500 Banks index up +2.02% at a thirteen month high, while the STOXX Banks was also up +2.17% to its highest level since May.

There was little to report directly on the trade war yesterday, though President Trump did say that a deal with China was coming along very well, while the Director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow said to Fox Business that President Trump could call off the planned December tariffs if the talks went positively. Meanwhile Reuters reported that China was seeking $2.4bn in retaliatory sanctions against the US in response to the US failing to comply with a previous Obama-era WTO ruling. This should be separate from the trade war noise. In the FX market, the dollar snapped a run of four consecutive sessions lower to close up +0.05%.

Overnight Asian markets are trading mixed with the Kospi (+1.17%) and Hang Seng (+0.15%) up while the Shanghai Comp (-0.09%) is down. Japanese markets are closed for a holiday. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.20%.

In other news, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in national elections with a reduced mandate as his Liberal Party won or was leading in 155 of Canada’s 338 electoral districts, short of the 170 needed for a majority in Parliament. The most likely partner for Trudeau would be the pro-labor New Democratic Party, which is on track to win 26 seats, giving the two parties a combined 181. The Canadian dollar is trading largely flat this morning at 1.3082.

Chilean assets slumped yesterday as markets reacted to recent protests in the country that have seen 11 people killed. The country’s IPSA equity index was down -4.61%, its worst daily performance in nearly two years, while the Chilean peso weakened -2.26% against the US dollar, its sharpest depreciation in four years. The unrest was originally started by a now-suspended rise in public transport fares, but has since become a broader movement against inequality and economic conditions. President Sebastian Pinera has taken a tough stance against the rioters, saying in a speech on Sunday night that “We are at war against a powerful, relentless enemy”. It’s worth keeping an eye out on copper prices (up a further c. 0.40% this morning), which rose to their highest level in over a month yesterday, as Chile is the world’s biggest copper producer and unions in the country have called for strikes that could threaten supply.

There was little in the way of data, though German PPI in September fell by -0.1% yoy (vs. -0.2% expected), which was the first yoy decline since October 2016. Energy prices dragged in particular, down -1.9% over the last year, with the PPI excluding energy actually up +0.5%. However, the market’s expectations of euro area inflation seem to be rising, with five-year forward five-year inflation swaps up +1.5bps to 1.238% yesterday, their highest level in a month.

Turning to the day ahead, as well as the beginning of the debate in the House of Commons on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, earnings season picks up again, with releases including UBS Group, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, Novartis, Texas Instruments and United Technologies. In terms of data releases, we have UK public sector net borrowing for September, Canada’s retail sales for August, and in the US there’s September’s existing home sales and October’s Richmond Fed manufacturing index.

<p>It’s a huge week for corporate earnings, with around one-fifth of S&amp;P 500 members due to report, including McDonald’s and Procter &amp; Gamble on Tuesday followed by Microsoft and Caterpillar a day later. So far results have generally surprised to the upside, although estimates have declined sharply in recent week. Despite the beats, analysts are still cutting estimates&nbsp;for next year as the protectionist dispute between the world’s biggest economies continues to take a toll.</p>

<p>Futures closely tracked European markets which saw a flurry of company results including UBS profit&nbsp;beating estimates&nbsp;as the Swiss lender said it will book a roughly $100 million charge in the fourth quarter to restructure a unit. Helping European markets, drugmaker Novartis raised its&nbsp;earnings forecast for the third time this year. The European banking sector was off its best levels, however, with gains in tech and real estate names offset by losses in household, travels and construction.</p><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside id=""my_spring1"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""></aside></div><div class=""ad__wrapper-element"" style=""text-align: center;""><aside class=""out-placement"" id=""article-outstream"" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: inline-block; min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px;""><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });</script></aside></div>

<p>Earlier in the session, Asian stocks climbed for a second day, led by health-care firms, amid rising hopes that China-U.S. trade talks will progress toward an agreement. Most markets in the region were up, with South Korea - seen as a proxy for global trade - leading gains. Japan was closed for the Imperial Enthronement day. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.5% higher after erasing earlier losses, with Foxconn Industrial Internet and Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China among the biggest boosts. <strong>China’s central bank used open-market operations to inject the largest amount of cash into the banking system since May, as upcoming corporate tax payments tighten liquidity conditions. </strong></p>

<p>India’s Sensex fell 0.7%, snapping a six-day winning streak, <strong>as Infosys plunged following a whistle-blower complaint alleging irregular accounting at the software exporter. </strong>Infosys sank as much as 16%, weighing heavily on the gauge and more than offsetting post-earning gains in HDFC Bank Ltd. and Reliance Industries.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump&nbsp;stoked hopes&nbsp;that a trade deal can be reached next month, saying that China has indicated negotiations are advancing and has started buying more American agricultural products. ""There are still residual concerns about the outlook as we head toward Christmas with memories of last year’s price capitulation still fresh,"" said strategist Greg McKenna. ""But earnings so far aren’t as bad -- or should I say much worse -- than thought. And there is still much cash on the sidelines, and the increase in bond yields is mildly supportive of stocks.""</p>

<p>Eurozone government bonds yields fell on Tuesday, before a critical vote in British parliament crucial to determining whether the UK can leave the European Union in an orderly way on Oct 31. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two Brexit votes in the British parliament on Tuesday. Lawmakers will first vote on a Withdrawal Agreement Bill and then on the government’s timetable for approving the legislation.</p>

<p><strong>“It’s too close to call whether there will be a majority,” </strong>said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz. “<strong>This may be also very much reflected by market developments, that you don’t see major movement to one or the other side.” </strong>Johnson probably has the votes to pass the withdrawal bill but may struggle to pass his timetable on Tuesday, the BBC’s political editor said.</p>

<p>Ten-year government bond yields across the euro zone were down 2 basis point on the day. Germany’s 10-year yield was at -0.36%, bull flattening with German 30y yields 4.5bps lower. <strong>Analysts said much of the optimism around Brexit is already priced in and expect subdued reactions. </strong>Euro zone government bonds sold off as the first signs of a Brexit deal emerged; the German 10-year bond yield has risen 19 bps since Oct. 10.</p>

<p>“The market is pricing a lot of optimism, a) on the no-deal Brexit being taken off the table tonight, b) on the deal being approved tonight. Therefore, there’s not much room for rates to move higher,” said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.</p>

<p>As one would expect, overnight volatility in sterling remained elevated as traders position ahead of the Second Reading vote, with cable drifting below the key 1.300 level.</p>

<p>In other FX markets, the dollar caught a bid with EURUSD trading around Monday’s lows, CNH is offered above 7.0800, while <strong>Canada's Loonie traded flat after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&nbsp;won&nbsp;a second term in elections, though with a reduced mandate.</strong><strong> </strong>The&nbsp;shekel&nbsp;strengthened after Benjamin Netanyahu again failed to form a government in Israel.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Italian government bonds outperformed, the 10-year yield falling 6 basis points to 1.03%. “<strong>Think of BTPs at the moment as being bunds with greater volatility. </strong>So when the bund market sells off, BTPs tend to sell off more,” ING’s Bouvet said. The European Commission has sent a letter to Italian authorities, asking for clarification over their 2020 draft budgets. Rome will reply by Wednesday. That said, a major conflict is not expected, unlike last year when the Commission sent back Italy’s draft budget and asked for a new one, sparking a surge in Italian yields. <strong>Italy’s draft 2020 budget assumes a rise in its structural deficit of 0.1% of GDP. Under EU rules, it should fall to 0.6% of GDP. </strong>A successful sale of BTP Italia inflation-linked bonds to retail investors also supported Italian bonds</p>

<p>In commodities, crude futures popped higher off the Asian lows back into the green. Mixed trade in metals, LME tin drops 0.6. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. WTI prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its Brent counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020.</p>

<p>In geopolitics, Turkey President Erdogan vowed to go ahead with its Syria offensive ""more strongly"" if the US ""breaks its promises"". Further, Kurdish YPG Militia are to initially withdraw from the 120km strip of border with Turkey in Northeastern Syria, according to Turkish Security Forces sources.</p>

<p>Looking at the day ahead, as well as the beginning of the debate in the House of Commons on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, earnings season picks up again, <strong>with releases including UBS Group, McDonald’s, Procter &amp; Gamble, Novartis, Texas Instruments and United Technologies</strong>. In terms of data releases, we have UK public sector net borrowing for September, Canada’s retail sales for August, and in the US there’s September’s existing home sales and October’s Richmond Fed manufacturing index. Finally, the Hungarian central bank will be deciding on rates.</p>

Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were mixed despite a firm liquidity effort by the PBoC which conducted CNY 250bln of 7-day reverse repos for its largest daily net injection in nearly 5 months, with the mainland choppy ahead of upcoming earnings and with Hong Kong anticipating the announcement of further supportive measures for companies later today.</p>

Conversely, weak earnings from AMS (+0.2%), Thales (-2.2%) and Reckitt Benckiser (-3.3%) saw their respective share prices under pressure. In terms of broker moves, a downgrade for TUI (-5.7%) at Morgan Stanley saw the Co.’s shares sell off.</p>

</ul><p><strong>In FX, </strong>the USD is on a firmer footing, almost across the G10 board, with the DXY edging higher after testing support ahead of 97.000 yesterday and the index regains momentum to probe above 97.400 within a 97.440-259 range. However, the recovery looks largely due to declines in rival currencies rather than self-generated, as the Franc retreats further from recent peaks and Pound succumbs to a bout of more pronounced pre-UK Parliament vote jitters.</p>

<ul><li>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is off best levels, but still outperforming and maintaining a bullish bias while holding above 0.6400 vs its US counterpart and having breached 1.0700 against the Aussie. Conversely, Aud/Usd continues to fade ahead of 0.6900 even though news on US-China trade has been mainly constructive of late amidst signs of the pair reaching overbought levels and a decent option expiry at 0.6850 (850 mn) may also be weighing. Back to the Nzd, trade data looms and may provide some fundamental impetus, while the Aud could be prone to comments from RBA Deputy Governor Kent also due later.</li>
	<li>CHF/GBP - The major laggards as noted above, with Usd/Chf nudging towards 0.9900 and Cable retreating further from Monday’s 1.3000+ peaks in the run up to the WAB 2nd reading in the HoC that could set-off a chain of further votes and an extremely compressed timetable to get Brexit legislation in place for October 31. The Pound is holding above 1.2900 and managing to contain its pullback vs the Euro to circa 20 pips below 0.8600, as the single currency also fades against the Dollar.</li>
	<li>JPY/CAD/EUR - All narrowly mixed compared to the Buck, as the Yen meanders between 108.50-75, Loonie sustains gains within 1.3100-1.3070 parameters after the Canadian election and bulk of votes indicating that PM Trudeau is heading for a return to office with his Liberal Party, but also conscious that retail sales and the Q3 BoC business/loan survey are on tap and could impact. Elsewhere, Eur/Usd remains capped ahead of 1.1200 and has tested the 100 DMA (1.1136), but not convincingly.</li>
	<li>EM - Although the Dollar has pared some losses vs G10 peers and the Yuan has eased from recent highs, several regional currencies are staging comebacks of their own, like the Rand and even the Lira despite the impending end of the ceasefire and ahead of Turkish President Erdogan’s meeting with his Russian counterpart.</li>
</ul><p><strong>In commodities, </strong>WTI and Brent futures are choppy but ultimately in the green. Upside in prices coincided with reports that Indonesia’s Pertamina has temporarily halted fuel distribution via the pipeline in parts of West Java due to an explosion. Local media noted that the fire broke out on parts of the pipeline due to drilling activity in close proximity, although this was not confirmed by Pertamina’s spokesperson. WTI prices gained traction above the 53.50/bbl and currently eyes its 200 WMA at 53.81/bbl, while its Brent counterpart rose comfortably above the 59.00/bbl mark. In terms of demand side commentary, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2020 oil growth demand outlook to 1.3mln bpd from 1.4mln bpd and sees US oil growth expectations to be reduced, while it suggested there is room for OPEC output to increase beyond 2020. For reference, the firm’s demand forecasts are modestly higher than that of the EIA, IEA and OPEC. Looking ahead, trader will be eyeing the weekly API crude data, but before that over in the UK, the vote on the 2nd reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may prompt some sentiment-driven action. Elsewhere, gold prices remain firmer sub-1500/oz despite a bounce back in Dollar as participants could be hedging ahead of upcoming risk events, and with US-China also still on the radar. Meanwhile, Copper prices are on the backfoot today, mostly due to the indecisive risk sentiment coupled with a firmer Buck with prices back below 2.65/lb ahead of its 100 DMA at 2.63/lb. Finally, Dalian iron ore futures rose in excess of 1.2% at one point as the base metal was bouyed by continued supply woes after Vale halted a tailing dam earlier this month followed by downgrades in FY iron ore and pellet sales guidance.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the UK population is only 0.9% of the world’s total and that there are perhaps more important things for global markets in the greater scheme of things than Brexit but you only have to look at the selloff in 10yr bunds since the bilateral meeting between Varadkar and Johnson (+20.5bps) two weeks ago to see the impact that a no deal risk has had on markets. Famous last words but we should know a lot more by the end of today as to whether the U.K. will leave the EU by the end of next week (or soon after). As expected the government were refused the opportunity for a meaningful vote last night for reasons explained yesterday but they are pressing on with the Withdrawal Agreement Bill today, the text of which was published by the government last night. The timetable will be intense and perhaps one risk is that MPs feel like they are being rushed into it and don’t vote for a bill that they might have otherwise have done. The Government want to have it pass the House of Commons by Thursday (with midnight sittings) before going to the House of Lords on Friday in order to try to deliver Brexit by October 31st (next Thursday). There is a vote today on this timetable (7:15 pm London time) and that could be a big test for the government’s strategy. Before this, the government is likely to hold what’s known as the Second Reading vote at around 7 pm (London time)-- on whether Parliament agrees with the general principles of the bill. Sources this morning suggest Labour will abstain on this which would mean this vote will go through. If true Labour will use the amendments to create difficulties for the government.</p>

<p>We’ve copied the timetable below. Losing the Program Motion vote, which sets the timetable for the rest of debate, would simply make it very hard to hit the deadlines.</p>

<p>Tuesday</p>

<ul><li>12.30 p.m.Second Reading debate starts</li>
	<li>7 p.m.Vote on Second Reading - the general principle of the bill</li>
	<li>7.15 p.m.Vote on Program Motion - the timetable for the rest of the bill’s passage</li>
	<li>7.30 p.m.(If Program Motion passes) Committee Stage begins</li>

<ul><li>After 12.30 p.m. Committee Stage continues, with votes every three hours. Amendments on keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU and calling a second referendum are likely to appear</li>

</ul><p>Thursday</p>

	<li>After 5 p.m.Report Stage votes</li>
	<li>After 7 p.m.Third Reading vote -- the House of Commons’s final say on the bill</li>
</ul><p>Even if the Program Motion passes, the passage of this legislation is also likely to be fraught, as opponents of the Brexit deal have already said that they’ll seek to amend the legislation as it passes through the Committee stage. As we discussed yesterday, likely amendments to watch out for will be those calling for a second referendum and another seeking a customs union. Labour’s shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has also said that Labour would seek to avoid the possibility that at the end of the transition, the UK could simply revert to a no-deal scenario if no free-trade agreement has been reached with the EU. On Sunday it looked like momentum was building towards a customs union membership amendment passing. However the DUP seemed to indicate yesterday that they wouldn’t support it and a number of MPs who have previously supported it in indicative votes suggested they wouldn’t this time. Much might depend on the SNP and Lib Dems whose policy is to stop Brexit and therefore would only vote for it to bide time and complicate the government’s task. They may do so. The government have hinted they would withdraw the bill if such an amendment passes and we could soon be in caretaker government / imminent election territory. A second referendum amendment is not likely to pass according to those journalists close to the action but the Customs Union one is closer depending on the above.</p>

<p>Sterling was relatively strong yesterday as the dip was quite rightly bought, given the balance of risks, climbing above $1.30 in trading for the first time since May 13 yesterday. It ended up finishing -0.16% at $1.296, though that was +0.66% off its earlier lows from the open. Its trading up +0.16% this morning at $1.2981.</p>

<p>Amidst the political developments, equity markets advanced yesterday as optimism over the Brexit saga and positive noises on trade boosted sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. The S&amp;P 500 closed up +0.69% to reach its highest level in a month, leaving the index shy of just a +0.64% rise from its all-time high back in July. The NASDAQ (+0.91%) also advanced, although the Dow Jones was up just +0.21% thanks to Boeing, which fell -3.76% yesterday ahead of its earnings release.

The final results were released late Monday evening: Despite losing the national popular vote, Trudeau's Liberal Party won 156 seats, giving them a clear plurality of the vote. However, Trudeau's government will lose its outright majority, meaning that Trudeau will need to rely on votes from opposition parties to pass his agenda (the threshold for a majority in Canada's House of Commons is 170).

The Liberals had 177 seats when Trudeau dissolved Parliament 40 days ago at the start of the official campaign season.

Though he has established himself as an icon of liberal values and multiculturalism, Trudeau's ostensible commitment to feminism and bolstering the rights of minorities was exposed as cynical political posturing by the series of scandals that marred the final year of his first term.

His party lost its lead in the polls during the final weeks of the election, as several images of a young Trudeau wearing blackface surfaced, leading the PM to embark on a national apology tour that featured this cringe-worthy moment where Trudeau tries to explain what he did and apologize to a group of kids (because ""what kind of monster lies to a child?"").

&lt;br /&gt;

Though Trudeau managed to prevail over his conservative rival Andrew Scheer, the enthusiasm that helped his Liberals retake the majority after a decade out of power back in 2015 was clearly lacking this time around. As one pollster told WSJ, Trudeau has lost the luster of progressive icon, and has instead become ""just another politician.""


""Trudeau has become just another politician - and a flawed one at that,"" said Darrell Bricker, president of Ipsos Public Affairs, a polling firm.

Ipsos found that during the final weeks of the campaign 57% of Canadians didn't approve of the job Trudeau was doing.

To be sure, Trudeau pulled out all of the stops during his campaign. Sensing his old friend might be in trouble, former President Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by saying he backed Trudeau for a second term.

Then again, winning back-to-back majorities is a relative rarity in Canadian politics. It hasn't been done since the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien back in the 1990s.

When it comes to the market reaction on Tuesday, it should be relatively mild, according to Jonathan Rose, a professor of politics at Queens University in Ontario, who spoke with Reuters about the vote.


""Historically, the Liberals have been kind of a chameleon party. They’ve campaigned from left and governed from the right. They’ll moderate the way they govern for the next few years.""

""Markets like stability and minority governments are inherently less stable than majority governments, but Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are a known commodity and so it shouldn’t be disruptive. Right now they don’t need the Bloc Quebecois. That’s probably a relief for the Liberals.""

""The poor showing of the NDP and the huge showing of the Bloc Quebecois is a surprise. I also expected the Greens to do a little better. I think they (the Bloc) were expecting 20 seats and to have over 30 is amazing.""

After Trudeau's victory was assured, President Trump tweeted his congratulations to the man who has sometimes been described as Trump's 'liberal foil'.


Congratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019
During his victory speech, given half in English, half in French, Trudeau thanked his supporters, and insisted that he now had a clear mandate to continue with his Liberal Party's program, adding that Canadian voters had rejected the ""austerity"" pushed by the Conservatives.

Written by Peter Diekmeyer, Sprott Money News

Mainstream media pundits, as usual, missed the key message when analyzing the results of Monday’s election, which returned Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to power.

On paper the country was divided as never before, with no clear winner. The Conservatives, who won the popular vote, picked up a meagre 34.4% of ballots cast.



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Yet while Canadians can’t agree on a leader or how to divvy up the loot, they were unanimous on one important issue: they trust government, and they want it to do more.

Once you filter through the double-talk, the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP, Greens, and the Bloc (who gathered a combined 98% votes) all put forward platforms that would increase overall taxes, spending, borrowing, and regulations during their mandate.



These results provide key lessons for prudent investors and advocates of a free market economy.

Vast bureaucracy, misleading statistics, collapsing productivity, and a growing debt cycle

During the past three years we have highlighted growing danger signals that politicians are essentially flying blind and that due to vast bureaucracy, conflicting interests, and use of misleading data points they couldn’t stop the country’s downward spiral even if they wanted to.



Productivity is collapsing throughout the system and gross domestic product hasn’t grown in major economies such as the U.S. in more than a decade (as calculated on a debt-adjusted basis, using a realistic deflator).

Canadian public sector debts, when combined with the country’s private, household and financial debts (much of which are de facto government guaranteed) now total an unbelievable $8.3 trillion.

That works out to nearly $1 million in debt for each Canadian under the age of 19, making the country’s youth the functional equivalent of debt slaves.

The results of the recent election suggest that either Canadians aren’t concerned with any this or that they trust future governments to do better.

Positive for democracy: bad news for free markets

For those who believe in free markets, the results of the Canadian election are even worse than they appear. Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, the only major party that could credibly promise to reduce the scope of government, got a meagre 1.6% of the vote.

The only positive sign for advocates of sound public finances came from the Libertarian Party of Canada. Party leader Tim Moen—who advocated elimination of all taxes (except the GST), the privatization of the Bank of Canada, and a return to the gold standard—managed to keep the party on its feet, despite being banned from the debates and deprived of media coverage from all major outlets.



“We are in a battle of ideas,” said Moen. “Right now even if a free market-oriented party won power, they would not be able to accomplish much. Things will not change unless we change the culture, and that process takes place one vote at a time.”

Investors’ big decision: trust governments or trust themselves

Gold, as is increasingly the case with all global macro developments these days, is a big part of the story.

Last month’s spike in repo rates to an unheard of 10% in the interbank lending market indicates that banks don’t trust each other, despite the fact that they are increasingly quasi-government institutions.

Only the intervention of the Federal Reserve, which promised to lend more to the banks directly and to start printing $60 billion a month to help fund the U.S. government’s current operations, helped cool things down.

All of this—buried deep in news releases and couched in technical language that no one can understand—raises an important question: if the banks don’t trust each other, should investors trust them?

The other choice investors face is whether to mirror the public’s faith in governments or hedge their positions with hard assets.

As for Canadian voters: H.L. Menken once described democracy as the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it: good and hard.

The re-election of Justin Trudeau has revved up Wexit talk in Canada...



Justin Trudeau



googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('article-outstream'); });

Brexit, Italexit, Frexit, Nexit, CalExit, Texit, and now Wexit? What likely started as a social media campaign to air a considerable portion of the electorate’s grievances against the federal government, a serious political movement in Canada may be born. Would this have serious ramifications for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his newly re-elected Liberals? Or, is it an annoying mosquito bite from Muskoka that needs scratching? While Ottawa may no longer need to lose sleep over a separatist initiative in Quebec, the nation’s capital might need to keep a close eye on the west as separatism is brewing like a Double-Double at the nearby Tim Hortons. The experts say that a split is unlikely to happen, but they said the same thing about the British and Brussels. It could be time to wake up and smell the poutine – or crude oil.

Western Alienation: A Primer

The term “western alienation” has entered the national lexicon, becoming just as Canadian as “grab your toque” or “a kerfuffle at the hockey rink.”

Despite being rich in resources and contributing a great deal to the gross domestic product, this part of the country feels disrespected, shunned, unequal, and underrepresented. From the perspective of westerners, the frustration is warranted; Ottawa seemingly concentrates primarily on the economic juggernaut of Ontario and the sensitive vote-rich province of Quebec. From the vantage point of other provinces and territories, the sentiment is: What about me? There is a reason people joke that Toronto thinks it is the only city in Canada, as well as the center of the universe.

The west contributes billions of dollars to the federal tax pool, but the equalization is not equitable. Alberta, for instance, has not received an equalization payment in more than 50 years. British Columbia and Saskatchewan got a fist full of bupkis last year. In other words, they are giving more than they are receiving.

Indeed, the federal government is quick to take the loonies and toonies generated from fossil fuels in Alberta or Saskatchewan. But when the time comes to defend these provinces from Swedish teenagers or the globalists, the prime minister is nowhere to be found. Oftentimes, the west can feel like they are being treated like troubled stepchildren whenever Trudeau arrives on the world stage.

Another big thing for the west is the lack of representation in Ottawa. Alberta only accounts for 10% of the House of Commons, but the province contributes about a fifth to the national economy. They believe that if they had better representation, the feds would come to the province’s aid when necessary. Between 2014 and 2016, when crude prices cratered from the global supply glut, Alberta crashed and burned – it is still trying to pick up the pieces to this day – and the feds (Tories and Grits) were absent.

Trudeau promised in his victory speech that he would fight for all Canadians, not just those who voted for him. But where is the incentive? When looking at the electoral map, you notice a blue conservative wave engulfing a third of Manitoba, all of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and half of BC. Though Trudeau needs to reach across the aisle to move forward with his agenda, he does not have to go on his knees to Members of Parliament from Alberta and Saskatchewan. The prime minister can get a helping hand from New Democrats in parts of Ontario or the Bloc Quebecois – and that’s it.

Heck, Trudeau no longer needs to show up to the Calgary Stampede in his cowboy outfit, pretending to have a good time.

Once Upon A Time In The West

Although Wexit was coined months ago by Peter Downing, it blew up on social media in the aftermath of the general election. Wexit’s Facebook page has nearly 200,000 members, the Wexit hashtag had thousands of tweets and retweets, and it garnered mainstream media attention.



Peter Downing

Downing now wants to use this momentum to form provincial and federal parties, telling CTV News: “We have to do this. Right now, there’s no hope, there’s no future … no reason why we have to have Justin Trudeau governing us.”

But not everyone believes this was an authentic surge. H+K Strategies says Wexit was “artificially inflated” by bots and content aggregators. But don’t tell that to the workers in the oil and gas industry, the truckers, and the farmers out west. If western separatism is genuine, then it would be led by these folks, the ones who feel disenfranchised within the current political structure. They are Canada’s forgotten man, as Liberty Nation wrote about earlier this year.

Consider the results of a recent Environics Institute survey: In Alberta, 56% of respondents agreed with the statement, “Western Canada gets so few benefits from being part of Canada that they might as well go it on their own.” This is up 28 points from 2010. Plus, United Conservative Premier Jason Kenney has given a shout out to the separatists, tweeting:

“Albertans have been rightfully frustrated by the unfair deal we are getting in the Federation going as far as to even express support for separation. I don’t want to let @JustinTrudeau push us out of our country. I’d rather focus on separating him from the Prime Minister’s office.”

Perhaps Wexit will be a thorn in the side of all central governments moving forward, mirroring the headache that was the Quebec sovereignty movement – to a slightly lesser degree.

Wexit Or Wemain?

So, what are the chances that Wexit happens? Well, let’s just say that the odds of witnessing the Toronto Maple Leafs win the Stanley Cup are higher. That is not to say that Trudeau should ignore it.



The Financial Post’s Yadullah Hussain made a recommendation that could symbolize an olive branch of good faith: Appoint a natural resources minister from the west. This could be someone who is not all about destroying the economy to appease latte-sipping disciples of Greta Thunberg.

That could be the first step. The other move could be to finally issue an equalization payment. Another idea is to quit being ashamed of the region’s energy sector when appearing in front of global warming zealots. Crude is still the main export for Canada, generating billions for the nation so that the head of state can visit private islands owned by a billionaire or to cover the government’s debt-servicing costs.

Oh, Dear!

They may not be dominating the national discourse, but there are many different separatist movements growing in various pockets, suggesting that there is a portion of the citizenry that is disgruntled with Ottawa. Are these just sour grapes over the 2015 and 2019 election results, or are they legitimate bipartisan endeavors? Whatever the case may be, the country would unite around at least one secessionist proposal: Toronto – nobody likes The Six anyway.

<p>Downing now wants to use this momentum to form provincial and federal parties, telling CTV News: “We have to do this. Right&nbsp;now,&nbsp;there’s no hope, there’s no future … no reason why we have to have Justin Trudeau governing us.”</p>

<p>But not everyone believes this was an authentic surge. H+K Strategies says&nbsp;Wexit&nbsp;was “artificially inflated” by bots and content aggregators. But don’t tell that to the workers in the oil and gas industry, the truckers, and the farmers out west. If western separatism is genuine, then it would be led by these folks, the ones who feel disenfranchised within the current political structure. They are Canada’s forgotten man, as&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.libertynation.com/canadas-forgotten-man-energy-workers/""><strong><em>Liberty Nation</em></strong></a>&nbsp;wrote about earlier this year.</p>

<p>Consider the results of a recent Environics Institute survey: In Alberta, 56% of respondents agreed with the statement, “Western Canada gets so few benefits from being part of Canada that they might as well go it on their own.” This is up 28 points from 2010.&nbsp; Plus, United Conservative Premier Jason Kenney has given a&nbsp;shout out&nbsp;to the separatists, tweeting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Albertans have been rightfully frustrated by the unfair deal we are getting in the Federation going as far as to even express support for separation. I don’t want to let @JustinTrudeau push us out of our country. I’d rather focus on separating him from the Prime Minister’s office.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps&nbsp;Wexit&nbsp;will be a thorn in the side of all central governments moving forward, mirroring the headache that was the Quebec sovereignty movement – to a slightly lesser degree.</p><aside class=""newsletter-insert""><div class=""newsletter-insert__left-section""><h2 class=""newsletter-insert__title"">NEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST</h2></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section""><div class=""newsletter-insert__right-section-flex-wrapper""><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext"">ZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX</p><p class=""newsletter-insert__subtext_cont"">Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.</p><form class=""newsletter-insert__form""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-text-input"" type=""email"" placeholder=""Your email...""><input class=""newsletter-insert__form-button"" type=""submit"" value=""Subscribe""><div class=""form__email-error"">Please enter a valid email</div></form></div></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__success-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__success-section-confirmation"">Thank you for subscribing!</h3></div><div class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section""><h3 class=""newsletter-insert__fail-section-error"">Something went wrong.

<h3><u>Wexit Or Wemain?</u></h3>

<p>So, what are the chances that&nbsp;Wexit&nbsp;happens? Well, let’s just say that the odds of witnessing the Toronto Maple&nbsp;Leafs&nbsp;win the Stanley Cup are higher. That is not to say that Trudeau should ignore it.</p>

<p><em>The Financial Post</em>’s&nbsp;Yadullah&nbsp;Hussain made a recommendation that could symbolize an olive branch of good faith: Appoint a natural resources minister from the west. This could be someone who is not all about destroying the economy to appease latte-sipping disciples of Greta Thunberg.</p>

<p>That could be the first step. The other move could be to finally issue an equalization payment. Another idea is to quit being ashamed of the region’s energy sector when appearing in front of global warming zealots. Crude is still the main export for Canada, generating billions for the nation so that the head of state can visit private islands owned by a billionaire or to cover the government’s debt-servicing costs.</p>

<h3><u>Oh, Dear!</u></h3>

<p>They may not be dominating the national discourse, but there are many different separatist movements growing in various pockets, suggesting that there is a portion of the citizenry that is disgruntled with Ottawa. Are these just sour grapes over the 2015 and 2019 election results, or are they legitimate bipartisan endeavors? Whatever the case may be, the country would unite around at least one secessionist proposal: Toronto – nobody likes The Six anyway.</p>

<p>Grab your parka, get your toque, leave your worries on the igloo, and direct your feet to the secessionist side of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
