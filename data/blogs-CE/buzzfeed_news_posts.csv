For the love of god can we please just give the NDP an actual chance this time? I don't love their current leader, but another Conservative government would be absolutely awful. I'd still take Trudeau over them.

That being said, this was a MASSIVE f***up by Trudeau and the liberals. They were on relative thin ice already (since they originally lost power a decade earlier ultimately because of scandal). The only party to not be given a proper chance is the NDP. Harper spent a decade damaging the country (and it seems a lot of his former minions have adopted his practices and policies), and Trudeau has proven to not be quite the person a lot of people believed him to be. It's time to try something different.

Couldnt agree more! And let’s not pretend that conservatives ever cared about feminism. The fact that they have been calling Trudeau a bad feminist is political theatre and nothing more. This article also doesn’t mention that JWR herself admitted she didn’t think what Trudeau did was illegal. And yet she still went and made secret tapes. Of course she was going to be booted out. It’s not because she’s a woman.

The PMO office characterized the interaction as ""emotional"" thereby gaslighting Caesar-Chavannes that she remembered it wrong.

Almost all Canadians living abroad are going to be highly educated and hold white collar work or have valuable skills in demand. Which means we're going to be informed both domestically *and* internationally. We are one to two million people that SHOULD be voting in elections but can't.

And as for king's ignorant view that I'm some sort of leech on the system, again wrong. I may not pay Canadian income tax while abroad, but any consular and government services I need, I have to pay cash for. I don't get a free ride.

Trubadour is a fraud, a song and dance clown of no substance, no spine and no decency. He is the asshole who gave the catjolic cult a free pass on paying compensation to victims of residential schools, now taxpayers have to foot the entire bill. He's also the asshole trying to criminalize BDS and label all valid criticism of israel ""anti-semitism"" (e.g. in 2004, israel used stolen Canadian passports to perform assassinations in other countries).

And when am I going to get my right to vote back? Between 1.4m and 2.0m Canadians living abroad for several years have been denied the right to vote for a decade. Trubadour broke his promise to fix that. With 22m adults in Canada, that's enough people to change an entire federal election.

This really makes me hope we finally get an NDP government, something that should have happened in the last election.

16,BuzzFeed News Home,Canadian Political Parties Have Already Been Targeted By Foreign Hacking Ahead Of The Fall Elections,2019-04-08 10:03:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Canadian political parties have already been targeted by at least one foreign state-backed hacking campaign, the Star and BuzzFeed News have learned.

The Communications Security Establishment, one of Canada's security agencies, said Monday that “political parties, candidates and staff” were the target of one-tenth of state-sponsored hacking campaigns against the democratic process globally in 2018.

The spy agency was cautious in its wording of a long-awaited report into the threats to this October’s general election.

But the report makes clear that Canadian political parties and operatives have already been the target of sophisticated state-sponsored hacking in advance of this year’s general election — a fact that was not challenged by a senior intelligence source Sunday night.

This is a particular problem in Canada, where federal parties are not subject to any rules around what information they can collect, store, and analyze about Canadian citizens, and have no minimum standards for data security.

“[Foreign hackers] may steal information and then release it to the public for the purpose of embarrassing or discrediting the political party or candidate. In order to enhance this effect, a threat actor may modify information before releasing it to the public,” the report, which was shared with media organizations Sunday night, reads.

“Foreign adversaries may steal voter or party databases because they fetch a price on illicit areas of the internet, where large quantities of personal identity information are constantly bought and sold. They can steal sensitive campaign documents and communications and sell or release them. And they can disrupt or destroy a party’s information, networks and devises using malware, such as ransomware.”

The Star and BuzzFeed News reported last month that Canadian law enforcement and security officials are concerned that foreign actors are already attempting to influence the federal election.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Australia — all key allies to Canada — political parties have been targeted by cyberattacks during electoral events.

“We judge it very likely that foreign cyber interference against Canada would resemble activity undertaken against other advanced democracies in recent years,” the report reads.

“Foreign adversaries have attempted to sway the ideas and decisions of voters by focusing on polarizing social and political issues, promoting the popularity of one party over another, or trying to shape the public statements and policy choices of a candidate using cyber tools or social media platforms.”

The federal government has done little to insulate Canada from the threat.

Political parties are now required to publish privacy policies, but there is no independent oversight or auditing capabilities. There are no minimum standards on security practices. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould has, for the time being, ruled out rules for how political parties handle Canadians’ personal information.

According to CSE’s report, 88% of attacks on the “democratic processes” globally since 2010 have been “strategic” in nature — meaning not the compromises were not simply incidental to the ever-growing problem of cybercrime.

There is almost no precedent for this kind of report from a Canadian spy agency. While the CSE released a general report about threats to Canada’s elections in 2017, in the height of public interest in the 2016 US presidential election and the Kremlin’s meddling, there has been little specific intelligence released about threats to the Canadian electoral process.

“We assess that an increasing number of foreign adversaries have the cyber tools, the organizational capacity and a sufficiently advanced understanding of Canada’s political landscape to direct cyber interference during the 2019 federal election, should they have the strategic intent,” the report reads.

“[We] consider foreign cyber interference of the scale of Russian activity against the 2016 United States presidential election improbable at this time in Canada in 2019. However, we judge it is very likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference ahead of, and during, the 2019 federal election.”","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

Canada is politically different from the UK and yanks in several ways, so foreign spying and hacking won't be the same. Potentially, more difficult to do.

First, there are three viable parties that could form a ruling government, and minority governments are common. A majority can't dictate when there is no majority.

Second, provincial and federal parties may have the same name, but they function separately. The four liberal party premiers (out of 13 governments) DON'T answer to Trudeau.

Third, elections Canada still keeps a paper trail. If computers were hacked and data stolen or destroyed, we could still have a free, dair and trustworthy election.

Fourth, we still use paper ballots marked with pencils. ""E ballot"" fraud is impossible. When votes are counted, representatives of all parties are there to ensure there's no fraud. And the paper kept in case recounts are necessary.

23,BuzzFeed News Home,How A Facebook Page Dedicated To Fighting Anti-Semitism Became A Hub For Anti-Muslim Content,2019-04-12 18:35:00,Craig Silverman,,"A popular Canadian political Facebook page that promotes the far-right Jewish Defence League uses a deceptive technique that evades Facebook’s content bans and drives traffic to anti-Muslim websites.

Never Again Canada, which has nearly 235,000 followers, posts dozens of images, videos, and articles every day. The page says it is a platform to combat anti-Semitism, though its posts also stray into unrelated Canadian political topics, like the carbon tax.

Between the Facebook page and Never Again Canada’s Twitter feed, the group has a large platform to push out political messaging — and amplifies that message through synchronized posting with dozens of other anti-Muslim Facebook pages.

The trouble is people can never be sure about what they’re clicking on.

For months, the Never Again Canada page has been sharing links that appear to send users to sites hosted on Google’s Blogger platform, such as fpf-blog.blogspot.com. Once clicked on, the reader is redirected to sites such as freepressfront.com or speech-point.net. These obscure domains are filled with articles that twist and torque the news or fabricate headlines, such as “Canadian minister calls to criminalize criticism of Islam” or “Canadian PM calls on Canadians to welcome ISIS terrorists ‘If we welcome them, they won’t attack us.’”

As part of an ongoing series looking at the impact of online misinformation on the federal election campaign, the Toronto Star and BuzzFeed News identified 23 distinct Blogger domains posted by Never Again Canada that redirect to other websites, six of which are still active.

“What we’re seeing here raises two questions,” said Fenwick McKelvey, an assistant professor of information and technology policy at Concordia University. “One, do people know what they’re clicking on? And two, are these redirects being used to get around Facebook’s rules and standards?”

McKelvey, who researches political messaging online, says link redirection can be a harmless way to fix broken links, but it can also be used to deceive people about whom they’re interacting with.

Link redirection is a common technique used to share domains on Facebook that would otherwise be blocked by the platform. There are online tutorials that describe how to use a blog post to redirect to an otherwise blocked domain.

The practice violates Facebook’s community standards, which ban “misrepresentation,” including posting links with a URL that does not match the destination URL.

Never Again Canada also promotes events, including a recent recruitment campaign for the Canadian chapter of the Jewish Defence League.

In the United States, the FBI considers the JDL a “violent extremist Jewish organization” and deemed it a “right-wing terrorist group.” In Canada, JDL has hosted a far-right speaker, published anti-Muslim rhetoric and worked with the white nationalist group Soldiers of Odin, which was banned from Facebook this week","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

20,BuzzFeed News Home,"Facebook Says Page With Far-Right, Anti-Muslim Content Doesn’t Violate Its Standards",2019-05-09 22:01:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"A Facebook page that promotes false, far-right, and anti-Muslim content using deceptive techniques had been allowed to continue operating for nearly a month while the social media platform investigated its activities.

Now Facebook says the page doesn’t violate its community standards, showing how close to the line purveyors of false or misleading information can play in Canada’s upcoming federal election.

A recent report by the Toronto Star and BuzzFeed News showed that Never Again Canada, which has nearly 235,000 followers, spread misleading content and used a URL-masking technique to deceive its audience for months. The page also promotes and has ties to the Canadian chapter of the Jewish Defense League, an offshoot of a U.S. organization that the FBI has deemed a “right-wing terrorist group.”

For months, Never Again Canada posted links that looked as if they were leading to Blogger, the popular Google blogging platform. Instead, anyone who clicked on the link was redirected to other websites.

After investigating the issue for nearly a month, Facebook said the page does not violate the company’s community standards.

“We take abuse of our systems incredibly seriously,” Facebook Canada said in a statement Wednesday. “We proactively look for bad actors, and investigate concerns when they are raised. We are continually reviewing activity on our platform for potential violation of our policies and will take action in line with our community standards.”

Facebook’s community standards say the company doesn’t allow “misrepresentation,” but Never Again Canada has been able to continue the misleading link redirection.

In the weeks since BuzzFeed News and the Star published the investigation, the page has shared conspiracies and anti-Muslim narratives surrounding the Notre Dame fire, promoted petitions and events by the JDL, and continued to post misleading political content as the Canadian election nears.

The page also published, and later removed, a false video purporting to show militants in Gaza firing rockets at Israel. The video was actually made in Belarus in 2014.

Previously, Avi Shomer, Never Again Canada’s founder, said in an email that he can’t be held responsible for all the content on the page because he is simply one of 34 administrators and doesn’t know all of the others.

“I was the guy who got it started, that does not mean that I now own or control it. Since it has grown, it has spiralled out of my hands,” Shomer’s statement read.

Shomer referred BuzzFeed News and the Star to efforts his group has made to discourage racism on its Facebook page, including two statements posted on Never Again Canada’s website denouncing hate speech and “the general disparagement of Muslims.”

“We want Muslim Canadians to feel they are welcome here, that they, too, have a place to come and to contribute their voices in the common fight against anti-Jewish incitement,” reads one statement.

Over the past month, Facebook says, it has taken steps in Canada, the US, and the UK to ban far-right and white nationalist voices, as well as those who peddle conspiracy theories, from its platform.

On April 8, Facebook Canada announced that several far-right personalities and hate groups — including failed Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, the Soldiers of Odin, and the Canadian Nationalist Front — would be removed from its platform.

A month later, the social media company banned several more well-known far-right personalities, including Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Joseph Watson. It also banned Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has a history of making inflammatory, anti-Semitic statements.

But Facebook has had trouble enforcing those bans. A day after Goldy’s page and profile were removed from the platform, BuzzFeed News and the Star reported that paid ads for her website could still be found on Facebook.

After Farrakhan was removed, Reuters reported that thousands of videos of his comments were being posted across Facebook and Instagram. In Canada, members of banned white nationalist groups remain on Facebook, according to Anti-Racist Sudbury, which has kept track of the company’s progress.

The long investigation time and a lack of enforcement of Facebook’s own policies also come as Canadian lawmakers and the country’s intelligence community voice anxiety over the potential of foreign interference in the upcoming election. Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould has said that the government is considering regulating social media giants, saying “all options are on the table.”

“We recognize that self-regulation is not yielding the results that societies are expecting these companies to deliver,” Gould previously said in an interview.

In a statement, Amy Butcher, a spokesperson for Gould, said they fully ""expect platforms to address these issues and how they contribute to the spread of disinformation.""

It's also why the government is emphasizing ""citizen resilience,"" she said, and suggested that the best counter to misinformation is an informed population.

""[It's] important that Canadians think critically about what they see online, and to think before they share as a way to stop the spread of disinformation,"" Butcher wrote.

""We don't tolerate hateful speech in print, on TV or on radio, and we shouldn't tolerate it online either","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

Those assholes say worse things than Ernst zundel and Jim Keegstra. It shows just how spineless the government is about cracking down on rightwing hate speech.

Apparently, Farrakhan was banned as well and called ""far-right"" by regressive-left media. It means, all his followers (how many?!!) and Nation of Islam in general, are ""far-right""?. And Omar, leaders of Women's march, Keith Ellison, Maxine Waters... ""far-right"" and dangerous?. Why don't you tell us about them? The trick is, ""far-right"" and ""far-left"" happily merge in antisemitism.

26,BuzzFeed News Home,Canadian Lobby Groups Plan A Big-Money Ad Blitz Before New Election Rules Kick In,2019-05-28 16:01:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Canadian political parties and lobby groups are expected to spend millions on advertising over the next month in a big-money push for their political causes before new spending limits kick in.

Canada Proud, a national spinoff of the conservative Ontario Proud group, has spent “well over” six figures on advertising so far and has “big plans” for June, founder Jeff Ballingall told the Star and BuzzFeed News.

“Some of our larger donors are coming on board, and we’re doing some fun things in June,” said Ballingall, adding that Canada Proud’s goal is to help defeat Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“We’re spending, we’re advertising a lot on Facebook right now, doing a lot on YouTube,” he said. “We’re reaching millions of people every week.”

Ballingall’s efforts will be countered on the left by Engage Canada, which launched a television and digital ad campaign targeting Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Monday.

Engage Canada is a union-backed progressive coalition that has been associated with both Liberal and New Democrat strategists. It is painting Scheer as a “yes-man” for the wealthy who will cut public services, and its campaign ties Scheer to Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose popularity has plummeted in recent months.

“The Conservatives have made a strategic error in not defining Andrew Scheer, and we think now is a good time to remind them who Conservatives are and tell them who Andrew Scheer is,” said Engage Canada spokesperson Tabitha Bernard.

The timing of the two campaigns is no coincidence.

New elections laws put limits on third-party political operations in the months before an election — what the Liberal government calls the “pre-writ” period. On June 30, groups like Canada Proud and Engage Canada will be subject to strict spending limits on partisan activity, advertising and election survey expenses.

Until June 30, however, it’s largely a free for all.

All the new rules do “is manage when the groups are going to spend and in some ways how the groups are going to spend. It doesn’t change the fact that third parties are playing an increasing role in Canadian politics,” said Michael Pal, a law professor at the University of Ottawa.

“The third parties are playing catch-up to the parties. Now we are seeing them adopting their own strategies and not only doing political advertising. They’re doing organizing work of various other kinds.”

Third parties’ election activities have long been a concern for conservative activists in Canada, who have frequently accusing labour organizations and unions of using their considerable resources to push for progressive candidates and parties.

Last week, Scheer took issue with Unifor — Canada’s largest private sector union — being invited to submit a candidate for the panel deciding which media organizations are eligible for nearly $600 million in funding from the federal government. Unifor has vowed to “resist” the Conservatives’ election agenda.

In the House of Commons Monday, Scheer called on the government to remove Unifor, whose members include unionized workers at the Toronto Star, from the panel.

“None of the challenges facing the news industry justifies putting an openly partisan group on the panel to determine who gets funding,” Scheer said.

“Unifor has published tweets calling itself the ‘resistance’ to Conservatives. It’s bankrolling partisan attack ads put out by third-party groups.”

Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez accused Scheer of playing a “dangerous game.”

“The Conservatives are saying that journalists can be bought in our country and we strongly disagree,” Rodriguez said.

The Conservatives, who have long out-fundraised their main rivals, already have a round of election ads in heavy rotation on television and radio stations. Brock Harrison, a spokesperson for Scheer, described the campaign to Global News as a “multimillion-dollar ad buy.”

The governing Liberals have also launched a series of radio ads on climate change, accusing the Conservatives of wanting “to go back to the Harper years when pollution was free” — a reference to the Conservatives’ opposition to the federal carbon levy","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

15,BuzzFeed News Home,Facebook Won’t Remove Doctored Content During The Canadian Election,2019-05-28 17:00:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Facebook Canada said the social media giant won’t take down false or misleading content like doctored videos during the upcoming federal election campaign.

Representatives from the company told a committee of MPs from 11 countries Tuesday that it’s not Facebook’s role to decide the line between “free speech” and “censorship.”

Earlier, Canadian MPs on the committee — Liberal, Conservative, and New Democrat — voted unanimously to issue a second “standing summons” for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. The unprecedented move means that if either Zuckerberg or Sandberg step foot in Canada, they could immediately face summons to testify before the committee.

“We are very, very surprised that Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg decided to ignore the summons of a parliamentary committee, particularly as we have international representatives here,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus.

“As far as I know, we were not even informed that he wasn’t showing up. To me, I’ve never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons.”

The company decision to refuse to take down false content was a response to pointed questions from MPs about why Facebook is allowing a doctored video of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which was slowed down to make her sound impaired, to be shared across its platform.

“These are very important questions,” said Kevin Chan, Facebook’s policy lead in Canada, told reporters.

“That’s why we are here today. We welcome engagement with governments and legislators around the world, and we welcome the opportunity for governments of the world to tell us where they think we should be drawing the lines.”

Chan was speaking after a meeting of the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy — an international committee of parliamentarians created in the wake of Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal — in Ottawa on Tuesday.

Chan, along with Facebook global policy director Neil Potts, bore the brunt of MPs’ anger and frustration that CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg ignored the subpoena to testify before the committee.

Facebook Canada’s decision to leave content it knows to be false complicates its pledge, made only yesterday, to the Liberal government’s “declaration on election integrity.”

That declaration commits the social media giant to “work to remove fake accounts and inauthentic content on their platforms,” as well as “intensify efforts to combat disinformation to promote transparency.”

While Facebook may not remove doctored content, the Commissioner of Canada Elections — the independent office enforcing Canadian election laws — can still investigate the creation of fake or altered videos.

In advance of Tuesday’s hearing, Facebook sent out a long list of the steps it has voluntarily taken to help the Canadian government safeguard the election from misinformation and foreign influence, including creating a registry for political ads on the platform, funding civic engagement and media literacy campaigns, and trying to crack down on fake accounts.

But those efforts were clearly not enough for the political representatives around the table.

Damian Collins, the UK MP who has been spearheading the international investigation into Facebook, noted that while Facebook is cracking down on fake accounts, the company is still allowing misleading content to be spread by real users.

“Facebook takes more seriously someone spreading the truth from an inauthentic account then someone spreading lies from an authentic account,” Collins told reporters.

“That is the wrong priority.”","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

24,BuzzFeed News Home,How Dubious Claims About Muslims Wanting To Ban Dogs In Public Are Used To Stoke Anger,2019-05-29 15:31:00,Craig Silverman,,"In the summer of 2017, signs that seemed engineered to stoke anti-Muslim sentiment first appeared in a city park in Pitt Meadows, British Columbia.

“Many Muslims live in this area and dogs are considered filthy in Islam,” said the signs, which included the city’s logo. “Please keep your dogs on a leash and away from the Muslims who live in this community.”

After a spate of media coverage questioning their authenticity — and a statement from John Becker, then the mayor of Pitt Meadows, that the city didn’t make them — the signs were discredited and largely forgotten.

But almost two years later, a mix of right-wing American websites, Russian state media, and Canadian Facebook groups have made them go viral again, unleashing hateful comments and claims that Muslims are trying to “colonize” Western society.

The revival of this story shows how false, even discredited claims about Muslims in Canada find an eager audience in Facebook groups and on websites originating on both sides of the border, and how easily they can be recirculated as the federal election approaches.

“Many people who harbor (or have been encouraged to hold) anti-Muslim feelings are looking for information to confirm their view that these people aren't like them. This story plays into this,” Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft and the founder of Data & Society, a nonprofit research institute that studies disinformation and media manipulation, wrote in an email.


Boyd said a dubious story like this keeps recirculating “because the underlying fear and hate-oriented sentiment hasn't faded.”

Daniel Funke, a reporter covering misinformation for the International Fact-Checking Network, said old stories with anti-Muslim aspects also recirculated after the recent fire at the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.

“Social media users took real newspaper articles out of their original context, often years after they were first published, to falsely claim that the culprits behind the fire were Muslims,” he said. “The same thing has happened with health misinformation, when real news stories about product recalls or disease outbreaks go viral years after they were originally published.”

The signs about dogs first appeared in Hoffman Park in September 2017, and were designed to look official. They carried the logo of the city of Pitt Meadows and that of the Council on American–Islamic Relations, a US Muslim advocacy organization.

Media outlets reported on them after an image of one sign was shared online. Many noted that the city logo was falsely used and that there was no evidence actual Muslims were behind the messages.

A representative for CAIR told CBC News in 2017 that his organization had no involvement in the BC signs, but he did have an idea about why they were created.

“We see this on occasion where people try to be kind of an agent provocateur and use these kinds of messages to promote hostility towards Muslims and Islam,” Ibrahim Hooper said in an interview with CBC. “Sometimes people use the direct bigoted approach — we see that all too often in America and Canada, unfortunately — but other times they try and be a little more sophisticated or subtle.”

The ""Muslims of Vancouver"" Facebook page had a similar view, labeling it a case of “Bigots attempting to incite resentment and hatred towards Muslims.”","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

21,BuzzFeed News Home,White Nationalist Groups Banned By Facebook Are Still On The Platform,2019-05-30 15:01:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Over a month after Facebook announced a ban of a number of white nationalist, white supremacist, and other hate groups, they are still on the platform and continue to use it for recruitment.


After the deadly attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where the gunman went live on Facebook for several minutes before killing 51 people, the platform announced several bans around the world of known extremist groups. The bans were imperfect.

In Canada, many of the groups remained on the platform. In the US, an early announcement of the ban allowed those who were de-platformed to ask their supporters to follow them elsewhere. Now researchers are saying some of the banned groups are still active on Facebook, and attempts to report them have been ignored by the company.

“Facebook likes to make a PR move and say that they’re doing something but they don’t always follow up on that,” Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who researches online extremism, told a joint BuzzFeed News–Toronto Star investigation.

Kevin Chan, one of Facebook’s global policy directors, said while they proactively removed some hate groups, the company also relies on users, journalists, and other sources to report when banned personalities make it back on the platform.

Chan said that sometimes it may feel like whack-a-mole, but he considers it more of an arms race — with Facebook trying to get better at keeping listed hate groups off its platform, and those banned users figuring out new ways to find their way back online.

“Every time we are learning. Now, we presume they’re also learning … I think it’s really more of an arms race,” Chan said.

“But the trend line is that it is going to get really hard for people to do this, so hard to the point where … there’s going to be so much friction in the system that they’re probably going to go somewhere else,” he said.

Squire has been researching extremism on Facebook for years and said the ban didn’t capture most of the groups she has been monitoring. Squire provided BuzzFeed News and Toronto Star a list of groups that have made a comeback on the platform, including those that participated in the deadly Charlottesville Unite the Right rally.

Facebook removed all examples of the groups BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star sent to the company.

“Individuals and organizations who spread hate, attack, or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are have no place on our services,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We proactively look for bad actors, and investigate concerns when they are raised.”

One of those groups is the Proud Boys, which was banned last October after its members were filmed violently attacking three protesters in New York. The group used Facebook to organize, promote events, and recruit new members. According to an investigation by TechCrunch, the Proud Boys had over 35 functioning regional chapters.

Squire said the group was able to return to Facebook by slightly altering its name. One of their new pages was called PB Canada and included a link to a Telegram channel used to communicate with supporters.

Another page Squire is tracking, West is the Best II: Electric Boogaloo, directly pointed its fans to the Proud Boys USA website, showing how easy is it to circumvent enforcement of Facebook’s own rules, she said.

“They’re not so great at following up if the groups rebrand,” Squire said of Facebook.

Another issue is that while the groups themselves are banned, individual members remain on Facebook and continue recruiting.

A Canadian blog called Anti-Racist Sudbury documented how members of Soldiers of Odin, a group banned on Facebook, are still active on the platform. One member created a profile with the username “S.O.O.Recruiting.Sudbury.” He invited people to join the group’s activities and cross-posted content to groups such as Yellow Vests Canada and the conservative Canada Proud page.

A group with nearly 7,000 members called Sons of Odin is also still on Facebook, along with copycats that sell Soldiers of Odin swag.

Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, provided screenshots of him reporting the group to Facebook for hate speech. The company responded to say its Community Standards were not violated.

“If the group slightly rebrands to Patriots of Odin, they seem to be unable to figure [it] out,” Squire said.

League of the South is another example of a group that was banned, “but all of their members are still on Facebook, but promoting their own pages that maybe aren’t branded,” she said","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

BK Hart The protections of the 1st Amendment are a solute in that no locality can make laws prohibiting speech.

That DOES extend to all entities that receive government funding or protections (like media outlets that utilize public airwaves and band width).

I'm a Nationalist because I'm positive that the humanity's diverse cultures, heritages and ethnicities are all valuable, all different and those differences must be maintained.

In that regard I WANT Sharia-adhering Muslims to be able to espouse their morality that stones adulteresses to death, kills apostates and gays, etc., so that the West is alienated from them.

Looking to outlaw pro Nazi speech, for instance, requires that we also outlaw pro Marxist speech, which is equally offensive, and once we go there, we may as well outlaw all political speech...even legitimate criticisms of governments.…See More

13,BuzzFeed News Home,Canada’s Spy Agency Says Voters Are Being Targeted By Foreign Influence Campaigns,2019-07-02 19:01:00,Craig Silverman,,"OTTAWA—Canada’s intelligence community has identified foreign actors attempting to directly influence the upcoming federal election campaign, a Toronto Star and BuzzFeed News investigation has learned.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the country’s cyber defence agency, has briefed senior political staff of one federal party about “covert and overt” attempts to influence the Oct. 21 federal election.

Canada’s domestic spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), also said Tuesday that “threat actors” are trying to influence Canadian citizens, although the agency tied it to an attack on ""democratic institutions"" rather than the election specifically.

The agencies would not reveal the exact nature of the attempts to influence but said the scope of “foreign interference activities can be broad,” including state-sponsored or influenced media, hacking, and traditional spy operations.

“Threat actors are seeking to influence the Canadian public and interfere with Canada’s democratic institutions and processes,” wrote Tahera Mufti, a spokesperson for CSIS, in an emailed statement.

“For example, over the years (CSIS) has seen multiple instances of foreign states targeting specific communities here in Canada, both in person and through the use of online campaigns.”

A senior government source said that diaspora communities are being targeted by foreign actors in an attempt to sway the election’s outcome. The source, who has direct knowledge of Canada’s efforts to safeguard the federal election, was granted anonymity to speak frankly about ongoing national security issues.

While national security sources had previously said Canadian political parties have been targeted by sophisticated state-sponsored hacking campaigns, the motive for those campaigns was not publicly linked to attempts to meddle with the election.

Then on Friday, CSE confirmed it is briefing Canada’s major political parties on “covert and overt foreign interference activity” aimed at influencing Canadian voters — although the agency stopped short of publicly confirming such campaigns have already been detected.

The briefings included select security-cleared political staff and discussions around unclassified and classified material, the agency said. Unclassified material would be information already in the public domain while classified would be intelligence gathered by Canada’s spies or security partners.

The federal political parties were briefed so that they can “strengthen internal security practice and behaviours,” the agency wrote in a statement.

“Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the specific information covered in these briefings.”

The agency refused to discuss the nature of any specific threat — or who may be behind it. But the Canadian government currently has strained relationships with some of the dominant players in cyber warfare and espionage.

That includes China, with Beijing demanding the release of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, holding two Canadians in detention on spying allegations, and sharply restricting Canadian agricultural exports.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had “a number of conversations” with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the detained Canadians — former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — at the recent G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan.

“This is an issue we take extremely seriously,” Trudeau told reporters in Toronto. “I had a number of conversations with President Xi directly on this and the larger issue of Canada–China relations.”

Other well-known cyber players — Russia, Saudi Arabia, and India — have also had tense relations with Ottawa.

The motivations of those countries differ widely, said Stephanie Carvin, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs and a former intelligence analyst.

“There is actually a traditional espionage component of this, I’m sure,” Carvin said of hacking attempts against Canadian political parties.

Countries could be looking for blackmail material, for instance, or seeking to understand Canadian politicians internal discussions around hot-button issues.

“They’re going to be looking for a number of things,” Carvin said.

“There’s the traditional espionage component, they’re going to be looking for emails that are potentially embarrassing. The other thing they might be looking for, and this would be a big concern, is understanding how [political staff and politicians] communicate with each other for the purpose of generating forgeries … And then, of course, you get to learn what are the issues that political parties themselves are actually concerned with.”

How seriously Canadian political parties are taking those threats is an open question. While political staff from the major federal parties expect foreign countries to intervene in some fashion — whether publicly or clandestinely — in the election, how they’re protecting against those attempts is largely a secret.

“While the Liberal Party of Canada does not comment on specific security precautions, our party takes these considerations very seriously,” wrote party spokesperson Parker Lund in an email.

“The highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records … This has also included meetings and briefings for political parties from the Communications Security Establishment and their government partners.”

“Due to the classified nature of the briefings [with CSE], we cannot confirm anything we’ve heard within the briefings,” wrote Cory Hann, the Conservative Party’s director of communications.

“Of course, broadly speaking, the party is concerned with any attempts to improperly interfere with Canadian elections.”

CSE has been pressed into taking a lead role in the federal government’s efforts to safeguard the 2019 vote.

Along with the CSIS, the RCMP, and Global Affairs, the agency is responsible for “working to identify and prevent covert, clandestine, or criminal activities from influencing or interfering with the electoral process.”

In April, CSE predicted it is “very likely that Canadian voters will encounter foreign cyber interference ahead of, and during, the 2019 general election.” The Star and BuzzFeed News previously reported that at least one political party has been the target of sophisticated, state-sponsored hacking attempts — although national security sources could not say if those attempts were related to the upcoming election or more routine espionage.

Political parties have consistently been a weak link for hostile nations to gather intelligence. In the US, France, and most recently Australia, hackers have targeted political parties — and in the first two cases, leaked damaging information about politicians and campaigns.

CSE is also holding monthly teleconferences for federal political parties to “discuss cyber security advice and guidance, as well as a general overview of the threat environment.”

Alex Wilner, a Carleton University professor studying intelligence and defense issues, said Canada’s intelligence agencies could be sending a message to hostile actors that they’re watching.

“This might be them messaging not just political parties and Canadians, but their messaging foreigners, those who are doing the influencing, saying ‘we know what you’re up to’ with not so many words,” Wilner said.

As the election gets closer, Wilner expects foreign interventions to ramp up.

“Any opponent or adversary to Canada would have, you could imagine, would’ve instituted or developed a campaign of influence,” Wilner said.

“If you’re thinking of a state-based adversary, you can imagine that a campaign would be rolling out for a long time previous to the election. And then you’ve got all the trolls, and all the hate-mongers and the rest, who may or may not be part of a more coordinated campaign, jump on the bandwagon as the election approaches.”

BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election.

<p>OTTAWA—Canada’s intelligence community has identified foreign actors attempting to directly influence the upcoming federal election campaign, a Toronto Star and BuzzFeed News investigation has learned.</p><p>The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the country’s cyber defence agency, has briefed senior political staff of one federal party about “covert and overt” attempts to influence the Oct. 21 federal election.</p><p>Canada’s domestic spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), also said Tuesday that “threat actors” are trying to influence Canadian citizens, although the agency tied it to an attack on ""democratic institutions"" rather than the election specifically.</p><p>The agencies would not reveal the exact nature of the attempts to influence but said the scope of “foreign interference activities can be broad,” including state-sponsored or influenced media, hacking, and traditional spy operations.</p><p>“Threat actors are seeking to influence the Canadian public and interfere with Canada’s democratic institutions and processes,” wrote Tahera Mufti, a spokesperson for CSIS, in an emailed statement.</p><p>“For example, over the years (CSIS) has seen multiple instances of foreign states targeting specific communities here in Canada, both in person and through the use of online campaigns.”</p><p>A senior government source said that diaspora communities are being targeted by foreign actors in an attempt to sway the election’s outcome. The source, who has direct knowledge of Canada’s efforts to safeguard the federal election, was granted anonymity to speak frankly about ongoing national security issues.<br><br>While national security sources had previously said Canadian political parties have been targeted by sophisticated state-sponsored hacking campaigns, the motive for those campaigns was not publicly linked to attempts to meddle with the election.<br><br>Then on Friday, CSE confirmed it is briefing Canada’s major political parties on “covert and overt foreign interference activity” aimed at influencing Canadian voters — although the agency stopped short of publicly confirming such campaigns have already been detected.<br><br>The briefings included select security-cleared political staff and discussions around unclassified and classified material, the agency said. Unclassified material would be information already in the public domain while classified would be intelligence gathered by Canada’s spies or security partners.<br><br>The federal political parties were briefed so that they can “strengthen internal security practice and behaviours,” the agency wrote in a statement.<br><br>“Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the specific information covered in these briefings.”</p><p>The agency refused to discuss the nature of any specific threat — or who may be behind it. But the Canadian government currently has strained relationships with some of the dominant players in cyber warfare and espionage.<br><br>That includes China, with Beijing demanding the release of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, holding two Canadians in detention on spying allegations, and sharply restricting Canadian agricultural exports.<br><br>On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had “a number of conversations” with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the detained Canadians — former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — at the recent G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan.<br><br>“This is an issue we take extremely seriously,” Trudeau told reporters in Toronto. “I had a number of conversations with President Xi directly on this and the larger issue of Canada–China relations.”<br><br>Other well-known cyber players — Russia, Saudi Arabia, and India — have also had tense relations with Ottawa.<br><br>The motivations of those countries differ widely, said Stephanie Carvin, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs and a former intelligence analyst.<br><br>“There is actually a traditional espionage component of this, I’m sure,” Carvin said of hacking attempts against Canadian political parties.<br><br>Countries could be looking for blackmail material, for instance, or seeking to understand Canadian politicians internal discussions around hot-button issues.<br><br>“They’re going to be looking for a number of things,” Carvin said.<br><br>“There’s the traditional espionage component, they’re going to be looking for emails that are potentially embarrassing. The other thing they might be looking for, and this would be a big concern, is understanding how [political staff and politicians] communicate with each other for the purpose of generating forgeries … And then, of course, you get to learn what are the issues that political parties themselves are actually concerned with.”<br><br>How seriously Canadian political parties are taking those threats is an open question. While political staff from the major federal parties expect foreign countries to intervene in some fashion — whether publicly or clandestinely — in the election, how they’re protecting against those attempts is largely a secret.<br><br>“While the Liberal Party of Canada does not comment on specific security precautions, our party takes these considerations very seriously,” wrote party spokesperson Parker Lund in an email.<br><br>“The highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records … This has also included meetings and briefings for political parties from the Communications Security Establishment and their government partners.”<br><br>“Due to the classified nature of the briefings [with CSE], we cannot confirm anything we’ve heard within the briefings,” wrote Cory Hann, the Conservative Party’s director of communications.<br><br>“Of course, broadly speaking, the party is concerned with any attempts to improperly interfere with Canadian elections.”<br><br>CSE has been pressed into taking a lead role in the federal government’s efforts to safeguard the 2019 vote.<br><br>Along with the CSIS, the RCMP, and Global Affairs, the agency is responsible for “working to identify and prevent covert, clandestine, or criminal activities from influencing or interfering with the electoral process.”</p><p>In April, CSE predicted it is “very likely that Canadian voters will encounter foreign cyber interference ahead of, and during, the 2019 general election.” The Star and BuzzFeed News <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/canada-targeted-hacking"" target=""_blank"">previously reported</a> that at least one political party has been the target of sophisticated, state-sponsored hacking attempts — although national security sources could not say if those attempts were related to the upcoming election or more routine espionage.</p><p>Political parties have consistently been a weak link for hostile nations to gather intelligence. In the US, France, and most recently Australia, hackers have targeted political parties — and in the first two cases, leaked damaging information about politicians and campaigns.</p><p>CSE is also holding monthly teleconferences for federal political parties to “discuss cyber security advice and guidance, as well as a general overview of the threat environment.”</p><p>Alex Wilner, a Carleton University professor studying intelligence and defense issues, said Canada’s intelligence agencies could be sending a message to hostile actors that they’re watching.</p><p>“This might be them messaging not just political parties and Canadians, but their messaging foreigners, those who are doing the influencing, saying ‘we know what you’re up to’ with not so many words,” Wilner said.</p><p>As the election gets closer, Wilner expects foreign interventions to ramp up.</p><p>“Any opponent or adversary to Canada would have, you could imagine, would’ve instituted or developed a campaign of influence,” Wilner said.</p><p>“If you’re thinking of a state-based adversary, you can imagine that a campaign would be rolling out for a long time previous to the election. And then you’ve got all the trolls, and all the hate-mongers and the rest, who may or may not be part of a more coordinated campaign, jump on the bandwagon as the election approaches.”</p><p><i>BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election. This report was published as part of that collaboration.</i><br></p>

At least it's not happening just here in the U.S. Actually, that doesn't make me feel better.

14,BuzzFeed News Home,Foreign Actors Interfering In The Canadian Election Are Unlikely To Face Sanctions,2019-07-03 16:34:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Foreign actors are unlikely to face serious consequences over interference campaigns in the lead-up to Canada’s 2019 federal election, national security and legal experts say.

Canada’s intelligence agencies have already identified foreign influence campaigns playing out in advance of the election. But there are serious barriers for Canadian authorities to bring those behind the campaigns to justice.

The largest barrier is the likelihood that those interfering are based outside of Canada.

“It would be more likely if that individual had a nexus to Canada somehow, if they were actually in Canada or there was a Canadian connection [in assisting the interference],” said Leah West, a Carleton University professor and former national security lawyer at the Department of Justice. “[But] I think the chances of seeing actual criminal charges come to fruition and people facing prosecution is low.”

West referenced the US Justice Department’s move to indict 12 Russian intelligence officers in 2018 for their alleged role in stealing emails from Democratic Party operatives in the lead-up to the country's last presidential election.

There’s almost no likelihood that any of those charged will face trial in the US. But the indictments did provide clear details about the actions of a foreign power attempting to swing an election — details that are unlikely to be released in Canada, barring a decision by intelligence agencies to alert Canadians to a major meddling campaign.

Michael Nesbitt, a national security law professor at the University of Calgary’s Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies, said the US indictments were also meant as a signal.

“Now that’s OK for the US, who can send that signal without serious risk of reprisal,” Nesbitt said. But Canada is unlikely to take action that would have any effect other than sending a signal to a place like China, he said.

Nesbitt agreed it’s unlikely that Canadian authorities could successfully bring foreign meddlers — including hostile intelligence services, state-backed hackers, and pressure groups from outside Canada’s borders, among others — before a Canadian court. It’s also a problem for Yves Côté, the commissioner of Canadian elections responsible for enforcing election laws.


In a statement, Côté’s office said it could charge foreign actors under the Canada Elections Act of “undue influence” in the campaign. If the interference has a cyber dimension — as most interference attempts have in recent Western elections — an actor could also be charged for the unauthorized use of a computer. But the elections office would still face the practical challenges, as well as the expense, of bringing charges outside the country.

Côté’s office said it is not yet aware of interference campaigns on the scale of the 2016 US presidential election.

“That said, we are going into this election knowing that it is a possibility that will have to be addressed,” wrote spokesperson Myriam Croussette in a statement.

A joint Toronto Star–BuzzFeed News investigation revealed Tuesday that Canada’s intelligence community has already identified foreign actors attempting to influence Canadian voters ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election.

In a public report released in June, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service called foreign interference in Canada a “significant threat to Canada’s national security and strategic interests.”

“These activities are carried out in a clandestine or deceptive manner, or involve a threat, and target communities or democratic processes in this country,” the report read. “In many cases, influence operations are meant to support foreign political agendas, a cause linked to a conflict abroad, or to deceptively influence Government of Canada policies, officials, or democratic processes.”

While the spy agency said that foreign actors are already targeting Canada’s democratic institutions, they stopped short of confirming foreign interference specific directed at the upcoming federal election.

“In this case, defense is your best offense. That’s really the only way to protect ourselves,” said Bessma Momani, a University of Waterloo political science professor and senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

“It really requires increasing digital literacy … showing people how this works, the distinction between real news and fake news — all of that is going to be very difficult.”

For now, it will be up to the intelligence services — and their political masters — to determine when a threat is sufficiently serious they need to warn the Canadian public. But who makes that call will change when the election is officially called.

The task will then fall to a five-person committee of Canada’s most senior bureaucrats, who have been asked to assess the intelligence community’s information and make a call whether to warn voters.

The Critical Election Incident Public Protocol panel has already held “preliminary meetings” and received briefings from multiple security agencies, the Privy Council Office said in statement. The PCO said the panel will continue with regular meetings in the lead-up to the election and during the writ period","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

But the indictments did provide clear details about the actions of a foreign power attempting to swing an election — details that are unlikely to be released in Canada, barring a decision by intelligence agencies to alert Canadians to a major meddling campaign.</p><p>Michael Nesbitt, a national security law professor at the University of Calgary’s Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies, said the US indictments were also meant as a signal.</p><p>“Now that’s OK for the US, who can send that signal without serious risk of reprisal,” Nesbitt said. But Canada is unlikely to take action that would have any effect other than sending a signal to a place like China, he said.</p><p>Nesbitt agreed it’s unlikely that Canadian authorities could successfully bring foreign meddlers — including hostile intelligence services, state-backed hackers, and pressure groups from outside Canada’s borders, among others — before a Canadian court. It’s also a problem for Yves Côté, the commissioner of Canadian elections responsible for enforcing election laws.<br></p><p>In a statement, Côté’s office said it could charge foreign actors under the Canada Elections Act of “undue influence” in the campaign. If the interference has a cyber dimension — as most interference attempts have in recent Western elections — an actor could also be charged for the unauthorized use of a computer. But the elections office would still face the practical challenges, as well as the expense, of bringing charges outside the country.</p><p>Côté’s office said it is not yet aware of interference campaigns on the scale of the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>“That said, we are going into this election knowing that it is a possibility that will have to be addressed,” wrote spokesperson Myriam Croussette in a statement.</p><p>A joint Toronto Star–BuzzFeed News <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/07/02/canadas-voters-being-targeted-by-foreign-influence-campaigns-spy-agency-says.html"" target=""_blank"">investigation</a> revealed Tuesday that Canada’s intelligence community has already identified foreign actors attempting to influence Canadian voters ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election.</p><p>In a public report released in June, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service called foreign interference in Canada a “significant threat to Canada’s national security and strategic interests.”</p><p>“These activities are carried out in a clandestine or deceptive manner, or involve a threat, and target communities or democratic processes in this country,” the report read. “In many cases, influence operations are meant to support foreign political agendas, a cause linked to a conflict abroad, or to deceptively influence Government of Canada policies, officials, or democratic processes.”</p><p>While the spy agency said that foreign actors are already targeting Canada’s democratic institutions, they stopped short of confirming foreign interference specific directed at the upcoming federal election.</p><p>“In this case, defense is your best offense. That’s really the only way to protect ourselves,” said Bessma Momani, a University of Waterloo political science professor and senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.</p><p>“It really requires increasing digital literacy … showing people how this works, the distinction between real news and fake news — all of that is going to be very difficult.”</p><p>For now, it will be up to the intelligence services — and their political masters — to determine when a threat is sufficiently serious they need to warn the Canadian public. But who makes that call will change when the election is officially called.</p><p>The task will then fall to a five-person committee of Canada’s most senior bureaucrats, who have been asked to assess the intelligence community’s information and make a call whether to warn voters.</p><p>The Critical Election Incident Public Protocol panel has already held “preliminary meetings” and received briefings from multiple security agencies, the Privy Council Office said in statement. The PCO said the panel will continue with regular meetings in the lead-up to the election and during the writ period.</p>

Lol, yea, having to inject the agriculture industry with money in order to slow down the impending economic downturn caused by tariffs is really showing China. Cuz nothing says strength more than requiring a stimulus package in order to survive.

Maybe it's time to lay off the coke.

6315,BuzzFeed News Home,Canadian Spies See Their Vast New Powers As A Tool To Fight Foreign Influence Campaigns,2019-07-04 00:00:00,Jane Lytvynenko,,"Canada’s domestic intelligence agency sees its new “threat reduction” powers as a tool to disrupt foreign influence, including during the upcoming federal election campaign.The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) told a Toronto Star/BuzzFeed News investigation that it views its “threat reduction mandate” as “another tool” for the federal government to respond to threats including “foreign influenced activity.”The agency’s mandate allows it to take direct action to “reduce” threats to Canada’s national security and interests, rather than simply collect intelligence. It allows the agency to take an array of actions to disrupt threats, although more invasive actions — such as those that would violate Charter rights or break Canadian laws — require approval from a judge.“While CSIS cannot discuss the precise nature of our investigations, CSIS actively investigates any threats to Canada’s democratic institutions and supports the [government’s] collective effort to respond accordingly,” wrote agency spokesperson John Townsend in a statement.Canada’s intelligence community has already identified foreign operations targeting the country’s “democratic institutions” ahead of the Oct. 21 election. The Communications Security Establishment, Canada’s cyberdefense and espionage agency, has assessed that it’s “very likely” foreign actors will attempt to intervene in the election — although not on the scale seen in the 2016 US presidential election.CSIS was granted “threat reduction” powers by the former Conservative government in anti-terror reforms in 2015.The Liberal government has reined in those powers, requiring the agency to take only “reasonable” actions “proportionate” to the threat, outlining a list of acceptable disruption activities, and seeking a warrant for any action that violates Charter rights.For some, the threat-reduction powers are seen as a tailor-made tool to combat a complex threat like foreign interventions in an election campaign — where activities may compromise Canadian national security or democratic institutions, but where it’s unlikely authorities would pursue criminal charges.“Some of the core concerns around threat disruption is that when it’s used, it might conflict with the possibility of bringing future criminal charges,” said Leah West, a Carleton University professor who previously worked in national security law for the Canadian government.“Criminal procedure is unlikely to be instigated against [foreign] threat actors … that concern falls away, and threat reduction becomes a more ideal course of action.”But civil liberties groups have expressed concern about CSIS’s ability to disrupt threats with little public oversight — or even public knowledge — and those concerns are likely to be more pronounced when it comes to intervening during an election period.Cara Faith Zwibel, a director with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said it’s a “fundamental concern” for her organization.“We outside of the security [agencies] don’t really know what they’re doing, so I don’t know what threat reduction looks like in the election-interference context,” Zwibel said.“So even for a very laudable objective like ensuring our elections have integrity, we do still have concerns. … There’s not a lot of information about what security services are talking about in terms of what constitutes a threat to the election or, more broadly, sort of threats to democratic institutions.”Zwibel noted that there’s a broad range of activities CSIS could undertake under the threat-reduction mandate. The agency could, for instance, disrupt communications, interrupt or divert financial transactions, impersonate anyone other than a police officer, even interfere with a person’s movements.What those actions mean in the context of combating terrorism is clear, but it’s the first time the agency has been asked to disrupt threats in the context of an election.West said some of those concerns were valid but noted that the more invasive threat-reduction activities that could violate Charter rights or Canadian law require up-front judicial approval and are subject to after-the-fact review by watchdogs","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"" id=""mod-subbuzz-text-1""> <div id=""122954490"" class=""subbuzz-anchor""></div> <script type=""text/x-config""> { ""id"": 122954490 } </script> <p>Canada’s domestic intelligence agency sees its new “threat reduction” powers as a tool to disrupt foreign influence, including during the upcoming federal election campaign.</p><p>The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) told a Toronto Star/BuzzFeed News investigation that it views its “threat reduction mandate” as “another tool” for the federal government to respond to threats including “foreign influenced activity.”</p><div class=""clearfix js-ad-placement ad-inline ""> <div class=""ad-wireframe-wrapper ad-wireframe-wrapper--labeled"" data-wireframe-width=""728"" data-wireframe-height=""250""> <div id=""BF_WIDGET_210-1"" data-module=""ad-promo-inline"" class=""xs-relative ad-ex ad-promo-inline ad-ex--inline js-ad js-ad-210-1 ad-flexible ad--loaded ad-flexible--programmatic ad-flexible--undefined ad-content-ready"" role=""complementary"" aria-label=""Advertisement"" data-instance-id=""5""> <script type=""text/x-config"" class="""">{""adPos"":""promo-inline1"",""adType"":""ex"",""isInfinite"":true,""platform"":""autodetect"",""position"":1,""renderLookahead"":""x0.25"",""size"":[[5,5],""fluid"",[300,250],[728,90]],""targeting"":{""badges"":[],""bid"":""5095059"",""brain_tags"":[""adult-0"",""crime-40"",""non_profane"",""safe-60""],""nbs"":0,""nsfw"":0,""pos"":[""promo-inline1""],""sensitive"":0,""tag"":[],""trending"":0,""user"":""janelytvynenko"",""wid"":""210-1"",""infinite_index"":1},""viewability"":""high"",""wid"":""210-1"",""zone1"":""bfnews""}</script> <div id=""bf-item-210-1-1"" class=""""> <h2 class=""xs-mb1 xs-text-6 xs-text-center text-gray-lightest caps ad__disclosure--ex""> ADVERTISEMENT </h2> <div class=""ad-awareness-wrapper js-awareness-wrapper""> <div class=""ad-awareness__inner js-awareness-inner""> <div class=""ad-awareness__media js-awareness-media""> <div data-module=""ad-format-programmatic"" class=""js-ad-format ad-format-programmatic js-ad js-ad-210-1 js-ad-format-210-1"" id=""mod-ad-format-programmatic-3"" data-instance-id=""11""> <script type=""text/x-config"" class="""">{""adPos"":""promo-inline1"",""adType"":""ex"",""isInfinite"":true,""platform"":""autodetect"",""position"":1,""renderLookahead"":""x0.25"",""size"":[[5,5],""fluid"",[728,90]],""targeting"":{""badges"":[],""bid"":""5095059"",""brain_tags"":[""adult-0"",""crime-40"",""non_profane"",""safe-60""],""nbs"":0,""nsfw"":0,""pos"":[""promo-inline1""],""sensitive"":0,""tag"":[],""trending"":0,""user"":""janelytvynenko"",""wid"":""210-1"",""infinite_index"":1},""viewability"":""high"",""wid"":""210-1"",""zone1"":""bfnews"",""advertiserContext"":false}</script> <h2 class=""xs-mb1 xs-text-6 xs-text-center text-gray-lightest caps ad-animated ad__disclosure--ex""> Advertisement </h2> </div><div id=""div-gpt-ad-210-1"" class=""ad-slot js-ad-slot js-ad-slot-210-1"" data-google-query-id=""CP31rYjcteUCFRKUaQodcdEHmA""><div id=""google_ads_iframe_/6556/bfnews.desktop/en/news/promo-inline1_0__container__"" class="""" style=""border: 0pt none;""><iframe id=""google_ads_iframe_/6556/bfnews.desktop/en/news/promo-inline1_0"" title=""3rd party ad content"" name=""google_ads_iframe_/6556/bfnews.desktop/en/news/promo-inline1_0"" width=""728"" height=""90"" scrolling=""no"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" frameborder=""0"" srcdoc="""" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-pointer-lock allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" style=""border: 0px;

18,BuzzFeed News Home,A New Wave Of Canadian Partisan Media Is Invading Your Facebook Feed,2019-07-24 05:01:00,Craig Silverman,,"Taylor Scollon says he knows what Canadians on Facebook want: content about political issues that gets them fired up.

“Our mission is to advance a policy agenda, and so we tailor our content to that. That’s what’s rewarded on social media platforms,” he said.

Scollon is one of the people behind North99, a nonprofit that uses articles, memes, and videos to advance a left-wing policy agenda, primarily on Facebook.

Over the past year or so, that has largely taken the form of attacking Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his policy decisions. And on Facebook, it can get more traction than traditional news coverage.

“That’s what people click on and share more so than a story published by a newspaper … and our objective just happens to align more with the imperatives of social media platforms,” Scollon said.

North99 is part of a new wave of advocacy media — both on the left and right — that is reaching more Canadians than ever before, thanks to savvy approaches to Facebook. These pages and associated websites are generating millions of shares, reactions, and comments, and at times eclipsing the country’s biggest newspapers and broadcasters on the platform, according to a new analysis by BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star.

But the lines between traditional news reporting — with clear editorial standards and accountability — and these new media players can be difficult to discern, especially when you're distractedly scrolling through your newsfeed, according to experts.

Elizabeth Dubois, a researcher at the University of Ottawa specializing in social media and politics, said the average person might struggle to differentiate between news and advocacy on Facebook.

17,BuzzFeed News Home,A Set Of Facebook Pages Promoting Conservatives And Attacking Justin Trudeau Are Run By A Post Millennial Staffer,2019-07-26 13:04:00,Craig Silverman,,"Since January, a set of Canadian Facebook pages have been promoting conservative politicians, attacking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and sharing content culled primarily from conservative website the Post Millennial.

The pages — one for Ontario, one for Alberta, and one national — use the name Liberty Now and have more than 10,000 followers. They are part of a larger network of Facebook pages that cross-promote content from the Post Millennial, potentially reaching millions of Canadians in a matter of hours and at times rivaling the reach of the country’s biggest newspapers and broadcasters.

Yet despite its role in a network that is becoming increasingly prominent in the Canadian online media ecosystem, Liberty Now has never disclosed who runs the pages.

Multiple Facebook messages sent to the pages requesting information about their ownership went unanswered, but an investigation by BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star confirmed Liberty Now is the work of Yaakov Pollak, a former candidate for the provincial Conservative Party in Montreal who now works for the Post Millennial.


The opaque network and its associations with the Post Millennial and Conservative Party politics show how anonymous players on social media can blur the lines between advocacy, journalism, and marketing, according to Fenwick McKelvey, an associate professor at Concordia University who specializes in political communication.

“Either you’re a journalistic outlet where you have standards ... or you’re an advocacy group, in which case then at least you need to be transparent,” he said.

McKelvey said the anonymous operation of the Liberty Now pages “undermines the spirit of free and fair elections, because you’re not disclosing and having transparency” about links to political parties and partisan publishers.

Pollak, who previously ran a riding Facebook page for the federal Conservatives, acknowledged in an email that he created and operates Liberty Now. He said the pages are his and not run by the Post Millennial.

“I wanted to create a political hub for discussion, but I moved on from this project,” Pollak said of Liberty Now, adding that he considers it “failed” and “basically dormant.”

But the pages are updated consistently, sometimes more than once a day. That’s similar to another page managed by Pollak, Elect Conservatives, which has more than 79,000 followers and has become a key source of promotion for Post Millennial content. A recent analysis by BuzzFeed News and the Star found the Post Millennial’s content achieves impressive reach on Facebook, thanks in part to consistent promotion from a network of pages with no explicit affiliation.

Pollak said he “sometimes” helps manage the Post Millennial’s main Facebook page","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

The Postmillenial is definitely Right leaning but they do have some authors that are non partisan. My university prof. friend has his PHD and writes for them, he is definitely not a Conservative. He is a book author as well.
Have you called out PressProgress and North99 for their bias and Ed Broadbent Institute Funding?

22,BuzzFeed News Home,Incoming: No One Went Easy On Anyone,2019-08-01 08:18:00,Elamin Abdelmahmoud,,"All eyes on frontrunner Joe Biden at the second night of the Democratic debates

CNN promised a fight for night two of the Democratic presidential debates, and Joe Biden dived into it.

Before the debate began, the internet had a confused facepalm moment as Biden, in a hot-mic moment, told Kamala Harris, “Go easy on me, kid.” It didn’t matter though: No one went easy on anyone.

The former vice president was a frequent shot-taker and even more frequent target as the debate brought the expected shots from Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

Biden vs. Booker and Biden vs. Harris were two highly anticipated conflicts — and the shots they took hit in intensely personal ways as they scrutinized one another’s records in public office.

But the three — the highest polling candidates on the stage — also found themselves on the receiving end of sharp critiques from lower-tier candidates like former housing secretary Julián Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.

Protesters in the audience brought the debate to a halt as they called for officer Daniel Pantaleo, the New York police officer who killed Eric Garner, to be fired","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

19,BuzzFeed News Home,These “Canadian” Websites And Facebook Pages Are Actually Run From Overseas,2019-08-28 13:51:00,Craig Silverman,,"One of the top science articles promoted by Google News to Canadians last Sunday was awkwardly headlined “Are we Ready for Defending Earth from a Killer Asteroid?” The story was published by Advocator.ca, a website that says it “provides news on issues for affecting minorities in Canada.” It lists an office address in Gatineau, Quebec, and has bios with photos for six staffers on its website.

In reality, the site doesn’t have an office in Canada, the staff photos actually show actors who starred in a recent Ontario theater company's production of Twelfth Night, and one of the people running the site appears to be based in Romania, a BuzzFeed News investigation has found.

Advocator.ca is part of a network of more than a dozen websites that present themselves as Canadian news sources and use fake personas to publish content. They are connected to a larger group of roughly 50 live and offline sites that use at least 85 fake author profile photos. After being contacted by BuzzFeed News, Google said it had removed the network of sites from its AdSense advertising network, as well as from Google News.

“We can confirm that we have taken action against a network of sites that have violated our policies on deceptive practices and misrepresentation,” a Google spokesperson said.

Separately, the investigation found multiple Facebook pages presenting themselves as Canadian but that are actually run by accounts based in Kosovo, Israel, and the United States. In some cases, the pages and their associated websites spread false or misleading information, or promote visa advisory services to people wanting to immigrate to Canada. Two of the Facebook pages also tried to obscure their foreign origins after being contacted by a reporter.

The Facebook pages and websites identified in the investigation are not primarily focused on Canadian politics and as of now have not attempted to influence Canadians ahead of the fall election. But their existence shows how easy it is to masquerade as a reliable or authentically Canadian source of information, and to build up an audience and generate revenue with stolen and/or misleading content.

Ironic or what, Trudeau made his politically correct bed over the last 4 years, this is interesting. I’m hopeful Butts and Trudeau’s affinity for using identity politics will be dampened somewhat by this experience, I am a tad skeptical. Both wielded PC like a cudgel suppressing real debate for self-serving reasons, I can’t imagine them doing so in self protection mode.
I hope JT learns what the knife edge of PC feels like maybe then behaving with real tolerance, forgiveness, with classical liberal notions of live and let live. This photo is unremarkable but that JT has accused Canadians of e…See More

He's done. Bye bye Justin.Whether he stays until the election, which the Liberals are now guaranteed to lose, or if they somehow survive(highly unlikely), he would pretty much have to resign. Between this, the SNC Lavalin affair(google it),and making terrorists millionaires, he's done, from the PM's office, the Liberal party and politics entirely. Given that about 30% of Canadian voters are people of colour, this is the death knell for him, and the Liberals in the upcoming vote.Prime Minister Andrew Scheer, might as well get used to saying that soon. And, yes, I am Conservative, so, the past few hours since this story broke have been quite delightful for me. Tee hee.

Attia Rante Because JT has aggressively built a lot of his goodwill on being very inclusive and PC. He has used those ideas for his own advancement, and he has used those ideas to thwart others who are not as virtuous as he has claimed to be.

So now he has a bigger price to pay than Scheer would have to pay. It isn't bc JT is left and Scheer is right. It is bc JT has exploited PC culture and we now see he's a hyprocrite.

A lot of people did dumb racist shit and then learned better later on. His apology seems more sincere than most. But I don’t give a shit about this honestly.

I’m more concerned with his weapons deals with the Saudis and his broken promises to indigenous Canadians about the pipeline expansion he approved.

He can apologize about brown face all he wants. He can even MEAN that apology. But he’s still making trash decisions that are ruining the lives of (brown) people in his own country and abroad.

If they were part of a conservative party would you be as forgiving? Coming from a white person who thinks it is racist no matter who does it.

Does anyone believe that he is making fun of Asians and people with dark skin? What about people wearing spray tan? What should be the line? I seriously struggle to understand the rules. In the UK the measure of reasonableness was a man on the Clapham omnibus.

Maybe because I don't get the dynamics in USA and Canada but as an Asian, i don't get it? Like i know why blackface can be offensive because it exaggerated the face features playing into stereotypes by darkening the face or wearing indian garb on a visit to india? Why is that wrong? Will someone explain?

It's something those very people use for themselves... But at least you're actually thinking for yourself, and wondering if something is respectful, and acceptable. Congrats; you're doing better than most online, it seems (no sarcasm!).
It's always good to question, especially when discussing respect/lack thereof, of people.

Thank you for that. Heartening to see.

I think cross dressing is just cultural appropriation, but with gender. If he would have put on a dress, tucked in his weenie and danced around moms basement then people would be saying how brave he is.
So he wears brown face and people get mad? Get over it...

He IS good. Feminists/ PCs are like nowadays nazis, I swear, you are so toxic, this happened fricking 18 years ago for god's sake, different times today, it wasn't such a big deal at that time to dress as different culture, why are you scrutinizing people for somethig that wasnt offensive at the time when they did it.

6314,BuzzFeed News Home,Justin Trudeau Has Never Been The Progressive Darling You Thought He Was,2019-09-19 00:00:00,Scaachi Koul,reader,"My editor, loath though I am to hear it, routinely tells me that typing I TOLD YOU SO is not a great way to start an article.But how else do you expect me to jump into a conversation about Justin Trudeau? Our Nice Guy, cutie-patootie, gelled-hair, blue-eyes-like-the-deepest-ocean prime minister, who plenty of Canadians (me, I am talking about me) told you was actually far from the progressive sweetheart he presents himself to be. (Even BuzzFeed was not immune.) Our time to gloat has finally come. He’s been revealing in the past, but most people chose to ignore it: like when he sniped at an Indigenous activist asking him for clean water or when he was accused of applying political pressure on the attorney general (the first Indigenous justice minister ever) to defer prosecution against a major engineering and construction firm based out of Quebec and, look, we’re both bored now, so let’s get to the blackface.Did we expect the latest news coming out of Canada to be that Trudeau is embroiled in some racist scandal? Not specifically — and this is about as mundane as racist acts go — but clearly only because he lacks imagination. The real question isn’t “How did this even happen?” but rather “How did it take so long for someone to dig this up?”Yesterday afternoon, Time published a photo from a 2000–2001 private high school yearbook showing Trudeau, who was then a 29-year-old English teacher at this school, wearing brownface for an “Arabian Nights”–themed party, replete with a turban and Genie-esque cinched robes. Hours later, a photo of him in blackface from his own high school yearbook went public too. Then, my god, another photo showing him at that same “Arabian Nights” party in brownface flanked by two Sikh men also appeared online. Then, a video of him in blackface was published by the Global News. In one evening, Trudeau went from Our Prime Minister Who Has Never Worn Blackface to Our Prime Minister Who Has Worn It More Than Once. I mean, who has the time?Is this all made worse by the fact that Trudeau wasn’t just some random teen messing around, but rather the son of one of the country’s most popular and beloved prime ministers, and therefore he should have known he would forever be under an unprecedented level of scrutiny? It does! It absolutely does. His past actions are so hypocritical when compared to his current public persona, and it is infuriating. His 2018 family trip to India, where he sported what looked like elaborate bridal clothing, was cringeworthy then — but watching him piously press his hands together in prayer appears even more jarring now.It’s bad on its face, but it’s made even worse by the very important fact that the Canadian federal election is in just over a month and citizens are left with four choices so unsavory it’s hard to remember a time when it was this bad. Except, I guess, for the last time.Nearly everyone running appears to be an AI simulation of what the worst-case scenario would be for the country. UK and US politics are so loud, so garish and tacky in their racism, that it makes Canada look quaint — but only by comparison.

""Darkening your face, regardless of the context and circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface,"" the Canadian prime minister said Thursday at a news conference. ""I should’ve understood that then, and I never should’ve done it.""

When asked if he'd leave the party — he is in the middle of an election campaign — he said he would ""continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward.""

Trudeau initially did not answer when asked if more photos of himself in blackface exist. When asked again, he said he is ""wary of being definitive about this, because the recent pictures of this I had not remembered.""


""The choices I made hurt people, people who thought I was an ally,"" he said.

Trudeau said he had a ""difficult conversation"" with his children on Thursday morning about ""taking responsibility for your actions.""


""I regret deeply that parents had to have difficult conversations with their kids that were uncomfortable and hurtful because of my actions,"" he said.


Trudeau said he never told his campaign staff about the photos before they came out because it was ""really embarrassing.""

""I was embarrassed, particularly given the person that I've become and the leader that I try to be, that fights for people's rights and defends people against intolerance and racism,"" he said.

""I'm not that person anymore,"" he continued. ""I'm someone that understands the deep hurt caused by actions like that to people who live with discrimination every single day.""


On Wednesday, Trudeau apologized for the first photo, which showed him dressed as a character from Aladdin in brown makeup and a turban at an ""Arabian Nights""–themed gala in 2001, when he was 29.

""I regret it deeply and I'm deeply sorry that I did that,"" Trudeau told reporters shortly after Time magazine published the picture.

You have the same information everyone else has so you can drop the whole superiority complex. Last time you were trying to convince people that Canada closed it's boarders to refugees, which is hasn't. So you're not really proving your whole ""knowing more"" thing. You just parrot conservative talking points. If you think talking about Khadr is currently relevent, you're out of pace bud. If you're trying to shit talk Trudeau, SNC Lavalin is the better ticket. Weird that you know soooo much about Canada but missed that one, the currently relevent issue. The one where he blocked investigations into his own misdeeds.

In 1960 despite the law black people could barely go to school with white people much less use the same bathroom...by 1980 things still may not have been equal in mindset but certainly much different legally. Only in the past 10 years-likely 5-has gay marriage been permitted or legal. The point is-don't act like 20 years is nothing when so much happens that brings us progressively better and hopefully less ignorant. It seems technology however surpasses peoples moral and humane compasses. I'm not defending blackface-bbut this did nt happen yesterday and it does make a difference.

12,BuzzFeed News Home,Canada's Liberal Party Is Outspending Conservatives Nearly 3 To 1 On Facebook And Instagram,2019-09-20 06:01:00,Craig Silverman,,"OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party are outspending Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives nearly 3 to 1 on social media advertising in the lead up to October’s federal election.

Data compiled by ad.watch, which comes from Facebook’s own ad library, shows that since July 1 the Liberals have spent $738,715 in advertising on Facebook and Instagram. The total includes the official Liberal party account as well as Trudeau’s personal accounts.

By comparison, Scheer and the Conservative party have spent just $251,303 over the same period — despite having a larger campaign war chest.

“The cadence of the spend might be different, the Liberals might be going heavier early on and the Conservatives saving their money for the latter part of the campaign,” said Dennis Matthews, vice president of Enterprise Canada and a former Conservative advertising strategist.

“But when you look at the Conservative voter coalition and compare it to the Liberal voter coalition, for the Liberals, getting younger voters and millennials … engaged was so key to their 2015 victory, and these are younger people who are cord cutting and don’t watch a ton of traditional TV.”

The rest of Canada’s federal parties have spent comparatively little — and have comparatively little to spend. The NDP has spent $14,039 boosting leader Jagmeet Singh’s personal brand and $66,178 on the party’s Facebook page, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s party has spent $10,397. The Green party and the Bloc Québécois have spent just over $2,000 since July 1.

The Liberals' social advertising buy over the last three months translated into 48 million “impressions” — the number of times their advertisements appeared — on Facebook and Instagram, compared to the Conservatives’ 16.3 million impressions.

Ad.watch was created by Manuel Beltrán and Nayantara Ranganathan, both artists and activists, as a way to keep track of Facebook advertising data in bulk. It compiles data using Facebook’s ad API for 32 countries, including Canada, and their major political parties.

Federal political campaigns are tight-lipped about their advertising strategies — how much they’re spending, who they’re targeting and where they’re placing their ads. But tools like ad.watch and Facebook’s advertising registry are providing a largely unprecedented glimpse behind the curtain.

For instance, the ad.watch data shows parties are running the most ads in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province that’s crucial to forming government. But the Liberals are running almost as many ads targeting Alberta residents, despite most political observers writing off the party’s chances in that province.

Scott Reid, a former adviser to Paul Martin and a principal at Feschuk.Reid, said that parties don’t target advertising at only seats they can win — ad campaigns can also be used to motivate existing voters to volunteer and donate money to the party.

But Reid said the Trudeau Liberals approached the 2015 election with a philosophy of not giving up on any ridings — including those that traditionally voted Conservative or where the Liberals had little chance. Reid suspects Trudeau’s team has a similar strategy in this election.

“That philosophy produced and yielded wins in places where you might be surprised,” Reid said in an interview.

“Even when it didn’t produce outright wins … you actually cultivated local organization, local activists, and local activism in ridings where the party may not have been active for years and years.”

The ad.watch data shows that parties are fairly uniform in who they’re targeting — at least in their digital advertising. The Conservatives targeted all age groups with a similar number of ads, while the Liberals targeted more Canadians between the ages of 25 and 54. Men and women were targeted roughly equally by the two parties.

A spokesperson for the Liberal campaign said the party is launching a new wave of digital advertising focusing on Canadians who have a “personal connection” to the changes the Trudeau government brought in.

“The Liberal Party of Canada is always working hard to reach more Canadians and involve them in our movement — including on Facebook and other online platforms,” wrote Braeden Caley in a statement.

When asked about their party’s ad buys, Conservative spokesperson Simon Jefferies said the party discloses advertising expenses to Elections Canada after the campaign.

It’s not just political parties’ ad campaigns that Canadians can keep tabs on. Facebook Canada recently released data on ad buys from third-party groups and companies for the last three months.

A Star/BuzzFeed News analysis of the top 40 spenders during that time found that union groups have spent $389,961 on political advertising since July 1, when Facebook’s new ad transparency rules kicked in. Most of that, however, was spent by Ontario unions campaigning against Premier Doug Ford’s cuts to the education system.

Unifor, which has been vocal in its opposition to Scheer and the Conservative party, spent $171,937 of that total.

Environmental groups, including Clean Energy Canada and Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, spent $277,283 on political or social advertising on Facebook since July 1. Right-wing third parties have spent $195,423, including more than $96,000 by Canada Proud.

Of the top 40 spenders in Facebook’s registry, third-party and unions combined for $1.24 million in advertising spending on social or political issues since July 1.


BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star are investigating the ways in which political parties, third-party pressure groups, foreign powers, and individuals are influencing Canada’s political debate in the run-up to this fall’s federal election.

You don't have to spend money in advertising when your Prime Minister embarrasses himself all the time. That's the point.

Scheer doesn't need to spend money in Ontario, Ford is saving him tones by wasting our tax dollars attacking the federal libs. Letting teachers go left and right, but don't worry, they've got our tax dollars freed up to force private businesses to put their anti carbon taxes stickers up on gas pumps.

6313,BuzzFeed News Home,How Oil Industry Videos Have Skirted Canadian Campaign Disclosure Rules,2019-10-04 00:00:00,Craig Silverman,,"The video begins with images of angry protesters who “have attempted to landlock our resources.”Then it cuts to shots of oil rigs and roughnecks in coveralls and hard hats.“We’ve been busy reducing GHG emissions and maintaining the highest environmental and human rights standards for energy development in the world,” the voiceover says.Over pictures of waterfalls and sunsets, community barbecues and playing children, the narrative reaches a crescendo.“We create jobs and build schools, playgrounds and hospitals … pay doctors and teachers. … Canada needs us. The world needs us. We are Canadian energy and we are proud.”Amid an increasingly acrimonious national debate over pipelines and climate change, the video — which has more than 5 million views across YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter — has all the hallmarks of a political advocacy ad. But because the two-minute video was put online two weeks before the writ was dropped, and because it does not name a party or a candidate, it skirts the disclosure rules that would publicly reveal who made the video, who paid for it, and how much it cost.Canada’s election laws are among the strictest in the world, with hard caps on campaign and advertising spending and a ban on donations from corporations and unions. Amid growing fears of the potential for outside actors to manipulate election campaigns, stricter third-party rules were brought in earlier this year, broadening requirements for private interests to register and disclose their activities.But instead of increasing transparency, the new rules have pushed private interests to broadcast their messages earlier and earlier in the campaign cycle, when they can choose to remain anonymous.Outside of certain dates — June 30 for partisan ads and Sept. 11 for issue-based messages — Canadian election years are still a free-for-all where anyone can spend whatever they want without disclosing their identities or their funders.The oil video, titled “Supporting the well-being of every Canadian,” ends with the logo of a group called “Canadians for Canada’s Future,” whose bare-bones website was registered 10 days before the video was posted. Other than a Calgary address, the website has no information on who is behind the group.An email to the general mailbox, however, elicited a rapid response. Spokesperson Jesse Doenz was happy to talk about how a number of players in Alberta’s oil industry came together to make the project happen.Doenz, an investor relations manager at Birchcliff Energy, said the video was inspired by a similar video put out by Oklahoma’s Oil & Natural Gas Producers & Royalty Owners that proudly boasted of its technological and environmental advancements.“Some of the CEOs up here, including Mike Rose from Tourmaline [Oil], and [Birchcliff] CEO Jeff Tonken, were like, ‘We need to do something like this,’” said Doenz. “We only had five weeks to do it because we had to have the stuff out before the election in case energy is considered an election issue. There’s a bunch of rules around it, and we just didn’t want to be a part of that.”Rose did not respond to questions about his involvement. In a telephone interview, Tonken stressed that the video wasn’t made with the election in mind. It was an effort to have an honest conversation about energy.“We weren’t trying to influence the election when we started. Then we ran smack into the rules and stopped immediately,” he said.“The rules are so restrictive. You can’t pay for any advertising anymore,” Token said. “It stops anybody from doing anything, because they don’t want to get offside these rules.”Political messaging that falls just outside of the official campaign period is “one of the things that we do absolutely need to keep an eye on,” said Lisa Young, a professor of political science at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.“Transparency is important because it helps the person who sees the ad evaluate the source of the message,” said Young. “Is this a public service message that a group of concerned citizens have paid for? Or is there a corporation or a union that has a financial stake in the outcome of this public policy issue?”After corporate and union political donations were banned at the federal level in 2004, Young said, money that once went to candidates and political parties started to flow to outside advocacy organizations.“Back in the day, when corporations and unions could give money directly to political parties, we knew who was giving money to whom,” Young said.“Now, some corporations play an active role in the political conversation via this kind of third-party spending. And when it happens inside the writ period, we have some notion of who it is that’s putting the money forward. But when it’s outside of the election period, we don’t necessarily know.”Fixed election dates, which were instituted in 2007, have made it easier for third parties to execute their campaigns immediately before reporting rules and spending caps come into force.Dan Robertson, a partner at One Persuades, a public affairs marketing firm that works with third parties before and during election campaigns, said most outside groups time their spending with the rules in mind.“As a rule, there’s a bit more freedom and a higher spending cap in the pre-writ period,” he said. “Once the election starts, the cap becomes quite a bit more restrictive.”Third-party spending has come to be known as “dark money” in the United States because of its ability to escape public scrutiny. Run largely by groups called super PACs that supposedly act at arm’s length from political parties, US dark money has poured through loopholes so big they now attract far more money than traditional — and publicly disclosed — campaign donations.“We’re certainly not in the same place as the Americans by any stretch of the imagination,” said Young. “How dark is our dark money, really?”Doenz said there was no attempt to hide who was behind the video, which was launched with fanfare at the Calgary Petroleum Club on Aug. 26 with a number of oil industry CEOs in attendance.“We did the press release with my name on it, and we had the big release with 400 people,” he said. “Everyone knew it was coming from me. ... So we’re not trying to hide it at all. But we just didn’t have the names on the video because we wanted to make it inclusive.”Tonken said he has received emails from people around the country who have seen the video.“If people really want to know [who made the video], all you have to do is make a couple calls and you’ll end up here at Birchcliff,” he said.A decision was made to create an umbrella group rather than put company logos on the video, Tonken said, because of a fear that viewers wouldn’t watch the video with an open mind if they knew it was made by oil companies.The video was posted to Facebook and Twitter, and within hours it was shared by prominent Conservatives such as Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall, and businessperson Brett Wilson.It had more than 10,000 views in the first day.Since then, the video’s spread has only accelerated, reaching a total of 10 million people by early October, Doenz said, including paid ad buys. Along the way, it has been promoted by a panoply of right-leaning groups like the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Alberta Proud, and a number of oil industry groups, including the Modern Miracle Network and the Canadian Energy Network.Tonken credited the video’s success to both a promotional push and organic spread. They reached out to Kenney and asked him to share the video early on, and purchased advertising on Facebook, targeting French speakers in Quebec, and on the CBC’s website.While the video was posted before the official election period, its massive online circulation means it has continued to reach voters during the campaign.There are actually eight versions of the video — four in English and four in French — each with different titles like “Supporting the well-being of every Canadian” or “The world needs Canadian energy.”The videos cost more than $500,000 to produce and promote, Tonken said, money that was fronted by Birchcliff and Tourmaline. About 15 other companies later contributed, he said.“We started the distribution of the video before the election started. And then we stopped all paid advertising the day the election was called.”Doenz added that the video project was almost canceled because of restrictive election rules.“We were like, ‘OK, it looks like we can do all this and get it out before the election. But we have to be careful on timing.’”The Canadians for Canada’s Future video is not the only pro-oil third party operating on the fringes of this year’s election campaign. Since the spring, the oil and gas industry has been organizing to get its message out.Back in April, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer attended a secret meeting with oil and gas executives outside Calgary that was organized by the pro-oil group Modern Miracle Network. The meeting was first reported by the Globe and Mail.Modern Miracle Network, which is not registered as a third party with Elections Canada, did not respond to a request for comment.Shortly after the meeting, Scheer commended the Modern Miracle Network’s fundraising, calling it “a clearinghouse for effective pro-oil and gas advocacy” in an interview with the Daily Oil Bulletin.Tourmaline CEO Rose, who backed the Canadians for Canada’s Future video, is also on the board of the Modern Miracle Network and was reportedly in attendance at the April meeting, the Globe reported. The Star was unable to confirm this information.Rose donated $30,000 to the Conservative party during Alberta’s last election, but has since focused his donations on third parties. This spring, he contributed $20,000 to Alberta Proud, which blasted former premier Rachel Notley.The Modern Miracle Network donated $7,000 to New Brunswick Proud during its election last fall. Conservatives took power in both provinces.Ontario Proud, which helped elect Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford last year in Ontario, didn’t receive any donations from oil companies or their executives. But it did pay more than $30,000 to the strategy firm One Persuades — which is comanaged by Scheer’s campaign manager, Hamish Marshall — to produce TV ads in the months before the election campaign started. The ads later ran on CP24.Marshall referred comment to Dan Robertson, another partner at One Persuades, who said no one at the firm was affiliated with a particular campaign at the time.Elections Canada has produced a 69-page handbook to help third parties comply with the law.It requires any group that spends more than $500 on a “regulated activity” such as surveys, advertising, or door-to-door canvassing during the preelection or election period (from June 30 to Election Day) to register as a third party. If that group raises or spends $10,000 or more, it has to file periodic interim reports detailing donations and expenses. All third parties must file a final report four months after the election detailing all donations and expenses.Spending by third parties is capped at $1,023,400 for the preelection period and $511,700 for the election period. Foreign contributions are banned.Online videos, such as the one posted by Canadians for Canada’s Future, are not considered a “regulated activity” because they are not paid advertising. Paying to promote the video, however, would draw it into Election Canada’s rules.The rules are also written in such a way as to exempt groups running issue-based ads during the preelection period and those running explicitly partisan ads, as long as they ran before June 30.A group called “Engage Canada” ran a series of high-profile television ads attacking Scheer during the NBA Finals in June. The ads ceased immediately after the championship run, and the group is not currently registered as a third party with Elections Canada.The last update of its website was on June 28.On its website, the group says it is a “broad-based, grassroots organization” that has “received funding from groups, organizations, and individuals from across Canada.”Engage Canada did not respond to an interview request. In an interview with the Canadian Press in June, spokesperson Tabitha Bernard confirmed that the private-sector union Unifor (which represents the Star newsroom) had a relationship with the group, but would not specify its nature.Bernard declined to say how much the ads cost, but studies of previous NBA Finals show a 30-second ad cost $750,000 US in 2018.Any attempt to further extend election reporting rules and restrictions on third-party spending risks infringing on citizens’ rights to free speech, said Robert Boatright, the author of a comparative study on US and Canadian election financing and a professor of political science at Clark University in Massachusetts.“Once you go down that road, where does it end?” he said. “It seems unreasonable to say if your group truly cares about the environment, you got to shut up about it a couple months out of the year just because we happen to be holding an election.”","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"" id=""mod-subbuzz-text-1""> <div id=""123419321"" class=""subbuzz-anchor""></div> <script type=""text/x-config""> { ""id"": 123419321 } </script> <p>The video begins with images of angry protesters who “have attempted to landlock our resources.”</p><p>Then it cuts to shots of oil rigs and roughnecks in coveralls and hard hats.</p><p>“We’ve been busy reducing GHG emissions and maintaining the highest environmental and human rights standards for energy development in the world,” the voiceover says.</p><p>Over pictures of waterfalls and sunsets, community barbecues and playing children, the narrative reaches a crescendo.</p><p>“We create jobs and build schools, playgrounds and hospitals … pay doctors and teachers. … Canada needs us.

Several of the stories have been deemed false or unsupported by news organizations, including the Agence France-Presse, which was contracted by Facebook to debunk fake news.The website is run by Matthew Ricchiazzi, 33, an Ivy League graduate who has sought office in several New York state elections but never got his name on the ballot.A BuzzFeed News–Toronto Star investigation has confirmed that Ricchiazzi once offered to publish positive or negative coverage of political candidates for a fee. He also placed ads on his website for individuals and businesses that had never heard of him.Ricchiazzi would not agree to an interview before next week’s election. However, in a reply to emailed questions, he wrote: “We report in good faith and would never knowingly publish a falsehood. We are confident in all of our reporting to date, and believe it reflects a fair articulation of information obtained from confidential sources.”Among the apparently uncorroborated stories published by the Buffalo Chronicle is one alleging former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci “insisted” that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould be kicked out of the cabinet. Another claims the former CEO of SNC-Lavalin and his wife fled Canada to avoid being arrested on bribery charges.The website found real success with its report earlier this month that Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau paid more than $2 million to suppress a report about sexual misconduct. Despite being debunked by the Star, Snopes, and the Agence France-Presse, that story and its follow-up generated close to 100,000 shares, likes, and reactions on Facebook.While the Buffalo Chronicle has been publishing stories about politics in western New York since 2014, a shift to sensational Canadian content earlier this year has brought Ricchiazzi success on social media. Eight of the Buffalo Chronicle’s 10 most popular articles on Facebook are about Canadian subjects and were published in the last eight months. Collectively, they were liked, commented on, and shared on Facebook more than 200,000 times by accounts with a total of 4.4 million fans.Facebook has refused to take down the Buffalo Chronicle posts. “Misinformation as a whole does not violate our community standards,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “We don’t have a rule that says that everything you post needs to be true.”This week, Ricchiazzi and the Buffalo Chronicle have had their Twitter accounts suspended. However, the posts remain online.Earlier this year, the Canadian government passed reforms to the Canada Elections Act that ban certain false statements about candidates during an election.The office of the commissioner of Canadian elections declined to address any specific examples of potential breaches of election law. Spokesperson Michelle Laliberté acknowledged, however, that “there may be limits to the enforcement action that could be taken against individuals residing outside of Canada.”Michael Pal, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa, said it’s clear the law applies to foreigners, “but there’s not a lot that can be done.”“We have to start facing up to what does it mean to have media from across the border violating the law,” he said. “How do we deal with that?”Ricchiazzi did not answer a question about who wrote the articles about Canada. He told the Star and BuzzFeed News that “there were primarily three individuals who contributed to those reports.”He said he kept their names off the stories because “many of the folks who write for me would lose their jobs immediately upon it being discovered.”Ricchiazzi said his involvement in politics does not affect his ability to report news.“I feel absolutely no need to maintain neutrality, and think that critical journalism with an honest perspective is indeed better journalism,” he said.In the past, Ricchiazzi has offered to skew his coverage in exchange for cash. In a 2010 email obtained by BuzzFeed News and the Star, he asked if a local political candidate wanted to purchase content in the City Politic, another website he runs.“Fees are as follows: positive articles about your candidacy are $200; negative articles about your opponents are $400; and an editorial endorsement is $300,” the email read.Asked about the email, he said: “The value proposition was not appropriately articulated (and wildly underpriced).”Ricchiazzi has denied that these kinds of transactions continue, but on at least two occasions he has accepted payments from groups that support candidates and provided them with positive coverage.Earlier this year, Ricchiazzi received $6,000 US from a political committee formed to elect Peter A. Reese for Erie County executive, according to campaign finance disclosures. At the same time, the Buffalo Chronicle published three stories supportive of Reese’s legal battle to be added to the ballot. No disclosure of the payments is mentioned in the pieces.“Peter Reese retained me as a consultant for a very short period of time,” Ricchiazzi said. “Those fees were not in exchange for advertising or content.”Last year, Ricchiazzi received $2,000 and the Buffalo Chronicle received $1,000 from a political committee supporting Joel Giambra’s run for governor of New York, according to election records.The website posted at least five articles supporting Giambra’s candidacy, including one headlined: “Giambra, a Proud Moderate, Seeks the GOP Nomination With a Bold Plan.”Ricchiazzi said the payments were “for consulting services rendered.”","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"" id=""mod-subbuzz-text-1""> <div id=""123497916"" class=""subbuzz-anchor""></div> <script type=""text/x-config""> { ""id"": 123497916 } </script> <p>Despite Ottawa's widespread efforts to prevent online disinformation from distorting the election campaign, a website based in Buffalo, New York, has been freely posting viral stories about Canadian politicians that have no apparent basis in fact — and there’s nothing the Canadian government can do to stop it.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, the Buffalo Chronicle has published unsigned articles based on unnamed sources that allege backroom dealings at the highest levels of the Canadian government.

11,BuzzFeed News Home,The Buffalo Chronicle Ran Facebook Ads Promoting Dubious Trudeau Stories,2019-10-29 17:02:00,Craig Silverman,,"An American website that pumped out uncorroborated articles about Canadian politics during the federal election campaign was allowed to promote its content via paid ads on Facebook despite the fact that its articles have been repeatedly deemed false by news organizations, including by one of Facebook's own fact-checking partners.

This kind of contradiction — possible because political ads aren’t subject to the same fact-checking as nonpolitical ads — was singled out by Facebook employees in a scathing letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg made public this week.

“Misinformation shared by political advertisers has an outsized detrimental impact on our community,” stated the letter, signed by more than 250 employees, according to a report in the New York Times. “Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for.”

Under heavy criticism since 2016, Facebook has spent years investing in fact-checking to combat viral falsehoods. But that work risks being “undone” by a policy that allows users to pay to promote the very false claims Facebook claims to be combatting, the letter says.

“Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing,” the letter states. “Misinformation affects us all .. [It] has the potential to increase distrust in our platform by allowing similar paid and organic content to sit side-by-side … It communicates that we are OK profiting from deliberate misinformation campaigns by those in or seeking positions of power.”

In the final week before the Oct. 21 election, the Buffalo Chronicle paid to promote a story about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s alleged activities during undergraduate university, citing a single anonymous source. The week before, it placed an ad for its debunked story that claimed Trudeau had paid more than $2 million to suppress a report about sexual misconduct","<div class=""subbuzz subbuzz-text&#10;  &#10;  &#10;  &#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative "" data-module=""subbuzz-text"">

[It] has the potential to increase distrust in our platform by allowing similar paid and organic content to sit side-by-side … It communicates that we are OK profiting from deliberate misinformation campaigns by those in or seeking positions of power.”</p><p>In the final week before the Oct. 21 election, <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2019/10/18/theres-little-canada-can-do-to-stop-the-flow-of-false-viral-stories-from-buffalo-website.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/matthew-ricchiazzi-buffalo-chronicle-trudeau-claims"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">the Buffalo Chronicle</a> paid to promote a story about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s alleged activities during undergraduate university, citing a single anonymous source. The week before, it placed an ad for its debunked story that claimed Trudeau had paid more than $2 million to suppress a report about sexual misconduct.<br></p>

It's time to get rid of the comments section, Buzzfeed. It only feeds into the propaganda machine you are trying to combat (hence the difference between your UK comment sections). All the trolls have to do is ignore articles like these and focus one the ones they can acquire views.

And it isn't like this is a feature anymore. The best article you have is still primary featuring the comments of boomers.
