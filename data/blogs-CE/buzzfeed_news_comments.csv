First off, Trudeau did not perssure JWR to drop the charges against SNC, she was asked to consider a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, where the company would face large fines instead of criminal prosecution.  Execs at SNC were threatening to pull out of QC, potentially costing thousands their jobs.  2nd, it has come to light that JWR acted a bit unethically in her position by recording other people without their knowledge during calls (a no no in Canada) and irregulairties in travel expense claims.  She was shifted to another cabinet position, which she resigned from in protest, and was then expelled from the party.  She just wasn't very good at her job, and became a very devisive figure.  The commision stated that Trudeau commited an ethics violation, which results in a fine, and JWR herself has stated that no criminal laws were broken.

Trans Mountain is def an issue, but it's an issue thanks to our previous PM, Stephen Harper.  Long story short, he signed an agreement with China, and if the pipeline doesn't get built, Canada has to pay a fine to the tune of 150 million bucks.  Trudeau is, I believe, taking climate change seriously, and he's trying to enact change, and is doing a good job so far.  He's our first PM to take concrete steps into addressing it.

Blackface.  Not great but the pictures were from one school event 20 years ago, where he dressed up as Aladdin.  He owned up to the pics, apologized, and it was pretty much a non issue after that, except for the Conservatives.  Also the india thing.  If memory serves, I believe that there are some pictures circulating online of William and Kate currently doing the exact same thing Trudeau did.  Again, the people who made a big deal about it, Conservatives. Trudeau had the most diverse cabinet in Candian history, his ministers were split 50/50 between men and women, and he has 4 years of policy in place to prove that he is a feminist and not a racist.

There is resentment in Canada against Trudeau, some justified, but a lot because of his father Pierre Elliot Trudeau.  That resentment has been played upon by a group of Conservative Premiers, Doug Ford, Brian Pallister, Scott Moe, and Jason Kenney, who have all chosen not to work with the Federal government, but to act like children, make demands, and throw temper tantrums when they don't get their way.  They are trying to play using Trump style Republican politics, as was Andrew Scheer.  For anyone keeping track, Andrew Scheer just lost the election and will likely be investigated for ethics violations of his own as well as potentially breaking election laws due to lies he told about Trudeau.  Jason Kenney is currently under investigation by the RCMP for election fraud, Brian Pallister is getting slammed for not returning to his province from a vacation when a state of emergency was declared, and Doug Ford is so disliked in his province due to the massive cuts he's making to essential services, while giving his friends high level jobs and raises, that he was told to hide during the election to not affect the Conservatives negatively.",0.099453,0.20886135,"Ummm this article is not super accurate.
