312,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Happy New Year! What’s Brian Jean up to? Is the former Wildrose leader plotting a comeback,2019-01-01 02:16:00,David Climenhaga,,"Happy New Year!

So, now that it’s 2019, what’s Brian Jean up to?

Maybe it’s just me, but he’s sure acting like a guy who’s thinking about being a political candidate again!

You remember Brian Jean, don’t you? He used to be the leader of the Wildrose Party.

Indeed, he was the guy who emerged out of the weeds around Fort McMurray after retiring as the region’s Member of Parliament in January 2014 to save the Wildrose Party from the fate Danielle Smith and Jim Prentice had plotted for it, which was basically to drive a stake through its metaphorical heart.

As alert readers of this blog will recall, in 2014 Ms. Smith was the leader of the Wildrose Party Opposition in the Alberta Legislature.

In December of that year, she led eight of her MLAs across the floor to join the PC Government led by Mr. Prentice, a political coup that looked brilliant at the moment it happened. The Edmonton Journal crowed that Mr. Prentice had “crushed” the Opposition and created “a staggering 72-member political juggernaut.”

Some juggernaut. The bold strike quickly turned into a disaster for Alberta’s small-c conservatives, and in particular for the Wildrose turncoats in the Legislature. In addition to Ms. Smith, the defectors were Rob Anderson, the party’s House Leader, plus Gary Bikman, Rod Fox, Jason Hale, Bruce McAllister, Blake Pedersen, Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson. Remember them? Probably not. Not one of them remained in the House after the May 5, 2015, general election.

Five Wildrose MLAs didn’t heed their former leader’s call, but to say they were a dispirited crew when Mr. Jean stepped up to the plate would be an understatement.

Mr. Jean was elected leader of the foundering party on Feb. 25, 2015. He was elected to the Legislature with 21 MLAs in the election that brought a majority NDP Government under Premier Rachel Notley to power.

After that, he soldiered away, turning the party into a viable Opposition despite having to deal with both weak and rebellious caucus members. He worked hard to unite the Progressive Conservatives and his Wildrosers in a new party he hoped to lead.

But then Jason Kenney appeared out of the Ottawa woodwork, all slick talk and dirty tricks. In the fall of 2017, Mr. Kenney turned Mr. Jean’s political dreams into road-kill. Elections Alberta is now investigating the financing of the campaign of another leadership candidate, Calgary investment dealer Jeff Callaway, amid allegations it was ginned up as a “Kamikaze run” to undermine Mr. Jean while Mr. Kenney kept his paws clean.

If Mr. Jean concluded he was treated shabbily by the Kenney crowd, presumably most of us would agree.

So, all told, 2018 cannot have been an easy year for Mr. Jean. After his defeat by Mr. Kenney, he quickly exited provincial politics, stage right, resigning his seat on March 5. He’s mostly flown under the political radar since then, concentrating on his family (he married his former Parliamentary special assistant Kimberly Michelutti in 2016) and his family’s businesses.

In late November, he lost his mother, Frances Jean, one of Fort Mac’s most prominent business people and a huge influence in her son’s life. She was 86.

Now, however, Mr. Jean has popped onto the radar again.

On Christmas Day, he published a letter on his Facebook page explaining that while in 2018 “I mostly kept my nose out of politics,” in 2019 “I will be doing advocacy work to help return prosperity to Canada by fighting for the principles that led to Confederation.” He asked readers to visit BrianJean.ca.

He also sent out large numbers of Christmas cards to former supporters that, in addition to the normal seasonal message, asked them to visit the website.

On Saturday, he posted a similar statement in his Facebook page’s “About” section. “I will fight for the issues that matter to you that have been forgotten by our federal government and attacked by our provincial government,” he said in that one. “I’m going to be an activist for Albertans and their families to make sure governments stay accountable and work for the people they’re supposed to: you.”

He repeated his plea for readers to visit BrianJean.ca. To do what? To “help me be more vocal and get our message out.”

If you go to the website, there’s a form to let you subscribe to Mr. Jean’s mailing list. Nothing more. It’s rather mysterious.

So what’s up? Is he plotting some kind of comeback?

I’ve heard it said Mr. Jean is determined not to be the new Nancy Betkowski. This may be in response to rumours on social media he’s been eyeing the Alberta Party now led by former Edmonton Mayor and PC cabinet minister Stephen Mandel as a political vehicle. Or not.

Ms. Betkowski, also known as Nancy MacBeth, was the Alberta Conservative who lost the leadership race to Ralph Klein in 1992, rebranded herself as leader of the Alberta Liberals and lost to Mr. Klein again, very badly, in the 2001 general election.

Well, at least we know Mr. Jean won’t run as a Liberal. (Joke.) But that tidbit should tell us something about his thinking too.

Maybe Mr. Jean figures he can have another kick at the can if Mr. Kenney manages to prove he’s still a winner in Edmonton and then heads back to Ottawa to replace the hapless Andrew Scheer as a more credible challenger to Justin Trudeau. This would be sort of a Scott Moe strategy, Mr. Moe being the underwhelming Saskatchewan premier who replaced Brad Wall last year.

Or maybe Mr. Jean is operating on the theory there’s no point coming back if someone doesn’t ask you to.

Maybe he’s just dipping his toe in the water to see how inviting it is.

Maybe he sent former supporters all those Christmas cards just to see if they remember his name.

Whatever it was, we should keep an eye on Mr. Jean in 2019, methinks","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Like a Swami trained at the elbow of Jimmy the Greek — I’m going to go out on a limb right here, right now.

I find it hard to believe that Brian Jean didn’t remain closely connected to some former party members in some capacity, given Kenney’s polarizing and divisive nature. With inside United Conservative Party information (internal polling data), it’s very likely he senses Kenney’s personal approval ratings (vs Rachel Notley’s) is telling a much different story on the ground than the one foisted on unsuspecting Albertans by those aggravating, mendacious online (win-a-prize) polls we see published in all the Postmedia products and elsewhere. Brian Jean is nothing if not cagey. An election slip by Jason Kenney could conceivably pave the way for a rousing return to respectability amongst UCP members for Jean. Now wouldn’t that be a kick in the old activist’s pants?

Another possibility is the behind-the-scenes leaders of the UCP have determined Brian Jean may still have some influence with former Wildrosers and want to get him out front campaigning for the UCP team. They know their shady nomination tactics are being revealed and hurting their brand. Also, the Alberta Advantage Party became an official electoral party recently and the leaders (former builders of the Wildrose Party) stated last year they intended to run ordinary Albertans in every riding. They admited they felt betrayed by Smith, then Jean, and claimed none of their candidates would be current or former politicians. Maybe the UCP is getting a little worried about yet another right-wing party taking away some of their votes and wants Brian Jean to reassure some of those die-hard Wildrosers.

By the way, Happy New Year David and thank you for all you do!

I will vote for the party that has as it’s platform to open Alberta for Business, law and order, family values, reduce rural crime, be environmental friendly, increase health spending, build more schools, prudent public spending, reduce the deficit, etc.

Of course, only if there are some specific measures even among two or three of them.

Mr Brett: your list is interesting given the way politics are done here. “Open for Business”, law & order, family values, & reducing rural crime are all policy positions normally associated with conservative parties; environmental friendliness, increasing health spending, & building more schools, with more progressive parties. Prudent public spending is simply good governance, which should be a priority regardless of party label, but reducing the deficit is also normally a conservative platform plank—although rarely exercised when Cons are in power, with their focus on tax cuts.

That said, the current NDP government has initiated a number of reasonable measure on rural crime, and “family values” are also a progressive issue if you expand the definition of “family” beyond husband, wife, & 2.2 children. As for the deficit, the Notley government’s plan seems to be largely to grow our way to a balanced budget, wherein government revenues increase, and spending decreases, both gradually as a result of increasing economic activity & employment. Whether it works or not is still to be determined—early indications are that it was for a while, but may have faltered in the current quarter—but that’s the plan.

Several weeks ago, Mr Jean was interviewed on some CBC TV news program or other, and sounded like a none-too-bright raving loony. I’d never heard him before, so was interested in what he had to say on this phone interview.

He talked over the interviewer’s questions and showed the same deep understanding of equalization that all Alberta Conservatives repeat as mantra. A mantra not rooted in reality, but with Kenney pressing the “I’m an alien dictator from Proxima Centauri” button, and Notley occupying the former PC positions on oil, well, the right have had to come up with something, anything. Raving and talking over an interviewer like Mr Jeans’ with general rabid foaming at the mouth seems like the current plan. The CBC host couldn’t wait to end the interview, being of the mild type the Corporation uses to replace senior reporters on vacation; it was obviously painful for her.

Personally I haven’t heard any senior NS politician, even those from the backwoods, appear quite as lacking in basic logic or awareness as Mr Jean – I felt sorry for him for the impression he left viewers, and the uncomfortableness he obviously caused the host. As the Brits would have said back in the day – “We’ve got a right one ‘ere, lads!” Deary me, it was a poor showing and the man seemed oblivious of the mores of basic social interaction and courtesy, all while appearing none too bright.

Had a call from Pantheon Research the other day. They were doing a bit of voter choice questions, seemed to be a lot of Alberta Party questions. One question asked was something like, “Would you vote for the Alberta Party lead by Brian Jean?” I found this very interesting.
Thanks for the interesting and informative posts.

I would not vote for Brian Jean. One reason….he refused to stand up to those far right wing folks in Wild Rose whilst he was the leader. I expect a leader to lead and to do what is best for Alberta and Albertans. Not bow to wishes of a few who may hold sway in some way over the party.

I get the sense that Jean has a feeling all is not right in Kenney UCP land and is getting ready to pounce at the right moment. I suspect Kenney has alienated a number of former Wildrosers, and probably some current UCPers, with his disdain for the grassroots and at times heavy handed and arrogant style.

Perhaps Jean may find a Callaway type person to lead the attack on Kenney, so he can keep his hands relatively clean. If so, that sure would be karma.

The United Conservative Party’s notion of opening a Ministry of Truth is indeed juvenile, as Mr. Mandel proclaimed on New Year’s Eve. It also fundamentally misinterprets the way major oil companies are likely to want to position the industry in the difficult years Alberta faces in the future.

Accordingly, it is unlikely to achieve its presumed goal of making outsiders more sympathetic to Alberta’s economic needs, or even to be particularly effective bullying them to do what we want.

That said, Mr. Mandel’s Big Idea that so entranced the Calgary Herald isn’t much different. The Alberta Party leader proposes a kinder, gentler version of Mr. Kenney’s “Minitrue” to woo a little more and bully a little less.

That’s better, I guess, but it’s not likely to be much more effective for a number of reasons, above all the increasingly hard-to-deny reality of global climate change.

There’s also Alberta’s loudly proclaimed self-image as the victim of Confederation while benefitting more from the country’s constitutional set-up than any other province except perhaps Quebec – about which we complain bitterly and unremittingly. Surely other Canadians are growing impatient with this permanent pity party.


Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

What’s more, the prime minister has certainly contributed to Alberta’s problems – but not necessarily the PM that holds office right now. Alberta’s problems were being made worse before Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberals came to power in the fall of 2015, or for that matter before Rachel Notley’s Alberta NDP won a majority in the spring of that year.

As Chris Sorenson wrote in Maclean’s Magazine back in January 2015, then-PM Stephen Harper was Big Oil’s worst enemy thanks to “his relentless oil and gas boosterism.”

“It’s not like Harper needed to transform Canada into a granola-crunching utopia to keep the oil sands out of the international spotlight,” Mr. Sorenson observed. “He just needed to do something.”

Quoting David Anderson, federal environment minister under prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin, the article describes how Mr. Harper allowed oilsands development “to become a poster child for climate change” just as the Obama Administration and much of the rest of the world were starting to get worried about the state of the planet.

Moreover, Alberta also can’t be sure the process required to squeeze bitumen out of the province’s oilsands will never matter to end users, Mr. Anderson observed. “We can’t assume that oil is going to be a fungible commodity on the world market as it has in the past. There will be clean oil and dirty oil.”


Former federal environment minister David Anderson (Photo: Order of British Columbia).

Instead of emulating Norway and calling for a carbon tax that would have made it easy for a worried world to love Canadian oil, Mr. Harper bragged we were an oil superpower that could do whatever it wanted, telling a reluctant President Barack Obama he wouldn’t take no for an answer on the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Everything seemed to change later in 2015, with the election of Liberals in Ottawa and New Democrats in Edmonton. Then everything seemed to change again in 2016 with the election of Donald Trump, cheered by Canadian Conservatives, in the States.

But the fundamentals of the international market for oil and the realities that impact it haven’t really changed much at all. And Mr. Trump will soon be gone from the White House, quite possibly very soon. Which brings us back to Alberta’s propaganda plans.

Despite a modest difference in tone, there’s not much light at all between the supposedly more moderate Alberta Party headed by Mr. Mandel and the unblushingly immoderate UCP headed by Mr. Kenney when it comes to the plan for a propaganda ministry.

And there’s precious little light between either conservative party and Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP, which is already taking a similar approach without bothering to set up an additional layer of bureaucracy – which is, it could be argued, a moderately more conservative approach than that of the other two if you happen to be one of those who disparage Big Government.


Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper (Photo: Remy Steinegger, Creative Commons).

As has been said in this space before, surely the only thing standing between Ms. Notley’s NDP and an easy re-election victory in Alberta is the name of her party.

The seeds of foreign and domestic distrust for Alberta’s claims it operates the world’s most ethical and environmentally friendly oil industry were sown by Mr. Harper, ably assisted by Mr. Kenney, then his lieutenant in Ottawa.

Screaming at people who believe there must be a cap on oilsands production is unlikely to do anything but reinforce their belief. Threatening them will make it worse. A slick pitch like that proposed by Mr. Mandel may be better, but not all that much.

Going slow on promised environmental measures – as suggested by Premier Notley’s withdrawal of support for Mr. Trudeau’s climate plan because the Trans Mountain Pipeline isn’t being expanded fast enough – won’t help much either.

Even The Economist, the international magazine for people who wish they were rich, argues Alberta’s intransigence is not in its own interest when worldwide pressure to decarbonize is bound to increase.

In other words, the high priests of the Almighty Market declare in their house organ “eventually Alberta will have to reduce its dependence on oil.”

It’s easier now, they noted, for politicians like Ms. Notley and Mr. Kenney (and his kinder, gentler doppelganger Mr. Mandel) to blame Liberals in Ottawa, citizens in British Columbia and Quebec, and environmental groups in Canada and the United States, “than to admit that the oil industry and the province are suffering from self-inflicted wounds.”

“But the reluctance even to face the need for change is worrying.”

That’s not quite fair to the NDP, which has given some thought to economic diversification.

But the best choice would be for Alberta to work hammer and tong to create what the environmental fringe of the resurgent Democrats south of the Medicine Line calls a “Green New Deal.” In other words, it’s time for governments pick some economic winners instead of doubling down on an industry that increasingly looks like a loser over the long term.

But how likely is that in the Alberta of 2019? Sad to say, not very","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">The United Conservative Party’s notion of opening a Ministry of Truth is indeed juvenile, <a href=""https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/kenneys-oil-war-room-plan-juvenile-alberta-party-leader-stephen-mandel"">as Mr. Mandel proclaimed</a> on New Year’s Eve. It also fundamentally misinterprets the way major oil companies are likely to want to position the industry in the difficult years Alberta faces in the future.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Accordingly, it is unlikely to achieve its presumed goal of making outsiders more sympathetic to Alberta’s economic needs, or even to be particularly effective bullying them to do what we want.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That said, Mr. Mandel’s Big Idea that so entranced the Calgary Herald isn’t much different. The Alberta Party leader proposes a kinder, gentler version of Mr. Kenney’s “Minitrue” to woo a little more and bully a little less.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That’s better, I guess, but it’s not likely to be much more effective for a number of reasons, above all the increasingly hard-to-deny reality of global climate change.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s also Alberta’s loudly proclaimed self-image as the victim of Confederation while benefitting more from the country’s constitutional set-up than any other province except perhaps Quebec – about which we complain bitterly and unremittingly. Surely other Canadians are growing impatient with this permanent pity party.</p>

<p class=""p1"">What’s more, the prime minister has certainly contributed to Alberta’s problems – but not necessarily the PM that holds office right now. Alberta’s problems were being made worse before Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberals came to power in the fall of 2015, or for that matter before Rachel Notley’s Alberta NDP won a majority in the spring of that year.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harper-oils-worst-enemy/"">Chris Sorenson wrote in Maclean’s Magazine</a> back in January 2015, then-PM Stephen Harper was Big Oil’s worst enemy thanks to “his relentless oil and gas boosterism.”</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">“It’s</span> not like Harper needed to transform Canada into a granola-crunching utopia to keep the oil sands out of the international spotlight,” Mr. Sorenson observed. “He just needed to do <i>something.”</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Quoting David Anderson, federal environment minister <span class=""s2"">under prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin, </span>the article describes how Mr. Harper allowed oilsands development “to become a poster child for climate change” just as the Obama Administration and much of the rest of the world were starting to get worried about the state of the planet.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Moreover, Alberta also can’t be sure the process required to squeeze bitumen out of the province’s oilsands will never matter to end users, Mr. Anderson observed. <span class=""s2"">“We can’t assume that oil is going to be a fungible commodity on the world market as it has in the past. <i>There will be clean oil and dirty oil</i>.”</span></p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_28904"" style=""width: 248px;""><img width=""238"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-28904"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-28904"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Anderson-D-238x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Anderson-D-238x300.jpg 238w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Anderson-D-100x125.jpg 100w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Anderson-D.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-28904"">Former federal environment minister David Anderson (Photo: Order of British Columbia).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Instead of emulating Norway and calling for a carbon tax that would have made it easy for a worried world to love Canadian oil, Mr. Harper bragged we were an oil superpower that could do whatever it wanted, telling a reluctant President Barack Obama he wouldn’t take no for an answer on the Keystone XL Pipeline.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Everything seemed to change later in 2015, with the election of Liberals in Ottawa and New Democrats in Edmonton. Then everything seemed to change again in 2016 with the election of Donald Trump, cheered by Canadian Conservatives, in the States.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the fundamentals of the international market for oil and the realities that impact it haven’t really changed much at all. And Mr. Trump will soon be gone from the White House, quite possibly very soon. Which brings us back to Alberta’s propaganda plans.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite a modest difference in tone, there’s not much light at all between the supposedly more moderate Alberta Party headed by Mr. Mandel and the unblushingly immoderate UCP headed by Mr. Kenney when it comes to the plan for a propaganda ministry.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And there’s precious little light between either conservative party and Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP, which is already taking a similar approach without bothering to set up an additional layer of bureaucracy – which is, it could be argued, a moderately more <i>conservative</i> approach than that of the other two if you happen to be one of those who disparage Big Government.</p>

<p class=""p1"">As has been said in this space before, surely the only thing standing between Ms. Notley’s NDP and an easy re-election victory in Alberta is the name of her party.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The seeds of foreign and domestic distrust for Alberta’s claims it operates the world’s most ethical and environmentally friendly oil industry were sown by Mr. Harper, ably assisted by Mr. Kenney, then his lieutenant in Ottawa.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Screaming at people who believe there must be a cap on oilsands production is unlikely to do anything but reinforce their belief. Threatening them will make it worse. A slick pitch like that proposed by Mr. Mandel may be better, but not all that much.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Going slow on promised environmental measures – as suggested by Premier Notley’s withdrawal of support for Mr. Trudeau’s climate plan because the Trans Mountain Pipeline isn’t being expanded fast enough – won’t help much either.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even <i>The Economist</i>, the international magazine for people who wish they were rich, <a href=""https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/12/15/justin-trudeaus-climate-plans-are-stuck-in-albertas-tar-sands?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/justintrudeausclimateplansarestuckinalbertastarsandsfuelishbehaviour"">argues Alberta’s intransigence is not in its own interest</a> when worldwide pressure to decarbonize is bound to increase.</p>
<p class=""p3"">In other words, the high priests of the Almighty Market declare in their house organ “eventually Alberta will have to reduce its dependence on oil.”</p>
<p class=""p3"">It’s easier now, they noted, for politicians like Ms. Notley and Mr. Kenney (and his kinder, gentler doppelganger Mr. Mandel) to blame Liberals in Ottawa, citizens in British Columbia and Quebec, and environmental groups in Canada and the United States, “than to admit that the oil industry and the province are suffering from self-inflicted wounds.”</p>
<p class=""p3"">“But the reluctance even to face the need for change is worrying.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">That’s not quite fair to the NDP, which has given some thought to economic diversification.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the best choice would be for Alberta to work hammer and tong to create what the environmental fringe of the resurgent Democrats south of the Medicine Line calls a “Green New Deal.” In other words, it’s time for governments pick some economic winners instead of doubling down on an industry that increasingly looks like a loser over the long term.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But how likely is that in the Alberta of 2019? Sad to say, not very.</p>

Excellent post, but one minor correction. You refer to The Economist as “the international magazine for people who wish they were rich”

I believe a more accurate description would be “the international magazine for smart people who wish they were rich, and rich people who wish they were smart.”

I certainly agree that trying to push people to accept your point of view does not work and comes across as arrogant and turns people off.

I do however disagree with your belief that Harper should have called for a carbon tax so the world would love Canadian oil. Since the imposition of the NDP’s climate leadership plan I see no difference in opposition to Alberta oil, in fact I would say there is more opposition today than there was 3 years ago. I will certainly admit that I have no solution either.

You believe if Rachel Notley changed the name of the party she leads she could win easily. My problem with the NDP is this belief that more government is always the solution and private industry can’t be trusted, changing the name won’t change the outlook. An example of this was when Trudeau bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, David you commented(I am doing this from memory) that you felt that government would do a much better job of building the pipeline than private industry. Today you comment it is time for government to pick some economic winners. My thought is government decisions are made to slowly as they cannot be made by one person or without a great deal of consultation, by then the opportunity is lost. What government needs to do is create an environment where businesses want to invest not an environment where the government is doing all the investing! Enjoy your day.

If the government wants to not only pick economic winners, but run them itself, I’m good with that. But I suspect the public wouldn’t be, thanks to 30 years of conditioning by neoliberal propaganda. That said, my comment about the name of the NDP is not a suggestion that Premier Notley change it, but an observation of wonderment at the fact a government so cautious and conservative in its instincts is constantly excoriated as crazy Marxist radicals by a bunch of crazy market-fundamentalist radicals. There can be only one explanation for this, and that’s the name. DJC

Inspired by Mr. Kenney’s Ministry of Truth philosophy, I see the same group of truckers that intentionally held up traffic on the QE2 and other locations, and annoyed their supporters in the process, is now planning to pull the same stunt on the road from here to Ottawa. Lets build our support in Manitoba and Ontario by ticking the people off! You can bet a less friendly media will be sure to highlight the negative impact the slowed traffic caused, something our local media didn’t really cover.

Really, the whole thing reminds me of the boy complaining to his teacher: “I don’t understand it, I beat up every kid in the class twice, and still nobody likes me.”

I live in the NWT, on the Slave River. The oils sands is sending it pollution directly past my door. The Peace Athabasca Delta is the largest inland delta in North America and it is on three flyways. It used to be that a million birds would pass through a few years ago. It is being increasingly polluted and so is our river system. So it’s not just BC Alberta politicians don’t care about.

Kenney, Mandel, and Notley are standing on the wrong side of history and science.
The right-wing’s departure from reality may not be entirelyh surprising. What’s really disheartening is that the “progressive” party would join them.

Bring it on. Alberta’s hyper-militant defense of the indefensible only stiffens resistance.
If Alberta cannot govern itself responsibly and reduce GHG emissions, Ottawa will have to do it for us.
Kenney will leave Alberta more isolated than ever.

Will Albertans see an oilsands clean up policy in any of the election platforms of the UCP, AB Party, and NDP?

And how they’re going to make industry pay for it? Right now less than $2B put aside by industry to pay, under AB’s joke of liability insurance program that the oilsands industry keeps gaming. Even the Auditor General has warned about this huge problem.

Only the AB Liberals have urged action: 

https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/11/06/ndp-ucp-shut-down-emergency-debate-on-oilpatch-cleanup-costs.html

EXCERPT: ‘CALGARY—The looming, multibillion-dollar cost of cleaning up Alberta’s oilpatch isn’t an emergency, the governing NDP and the official Opposition told the provincial legislature Tuesday.

The NDP and the United Conservative Party made the statements as they teamed up to shut down an emergency debate on the issue, proposed by Liberal MLA David Swann. The oil industry could face an estimated $260 billion in financial liabilities, a joint investigation by National Observer, Global News, the Toronto Star and StarMetro Calgary revealed last week — a price tag Swann said could be a “silent financial tsunami.”’

Note that when the Auditor General raised a red flag in 2017, he didn’t have access to the *actual* internal data that AER has, that was leaked in 2018.

EXCERPT: ‘
Kelly Cryderman
CALGARY
Published May 5, 2017
Updated May 5, 2017

The estimated cost to clean up Alberta’s mines, mostly oil sands operations, has jumped in recent years – to $23.2-billion as of 2016.

According to new figures from the Alberta Energy Regulator, the total cleanup liability increased almost 12 per cent, from $20.8 billion in 2014, due to an uptick in oil sands mining activity. The province’s energy watchdog calculates the figure, which looks at end costs once mines are done their productive lives, based on data provided by the companies themselves.;’

I think most of Alberta must be saying “Stephen who”? It’s like the former Edmonton mayor just woke up from quite a Rip Van Winkle sleep at the end of the year.

As Edmonton mayor, Mandel could be relied on for pithy quotes and was very good at channeling frustration and impatience. It is a bit odd he has been so quiet for so long. I suppose it is hard to get much attention when you lead a smaller party, particularly when you don’t have a seat in the Alberta legislature. I think the Alberta party made a mistake in not choosing one of its existing Calgary MLA’s as leader. They might not be as pithy, but if no one is paying attention that does not count for much, as for Mandel’s experience – it is mostly at the civic vs. the provincial level, which is a whole different ball game. I also think it would also have been much easier for the Alberta Party to break through in Calgary with a Calgary leader and an appeal to the many former PC’s there.

However, I think Mandel may have finally figured out that if the Alberta Party wants to go anywhere, it will have to go after Kenney and the UCP, not the NDP. The Alberta Party’s target voters are more moderate/centrist conservatives, you know former PC’s – the kind of voters who are holding their nose right now and supporting Kenney, because they don’t quite see the Alberta Party as a serious alternative. Not surprisingly, the Alberta Party’s less confrontational approach to rehabilitating Alberta’s dirty crude image in the US and elsewhere in Canada is not that different from the approach the former PC’s took. However, I wonder if it is a bit too late for PR now. I think the PC’s and the Federal Conservatives failure to take the environment seriously over their last 10 years in power made Alberta a bullseye target for environmentalists everywhere. I certainly don’t think any party that wants to get rid of the carbon tax here, confrontational or not, will be taken seriously outside of Alberta and if such a party comes to power, this will only add to our troubles in getting pipeline projects approved beyond our provincial borders.

I suppose we will have to wait and see if Mandel has finally started to find his voice again or if this attack on the UCP is just a one time thing and Alberta voters will just go back to ignoring him and the Alberta Party.

307,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"Brian Topp, NDP strategist who led Rachel Notley’s 2015 war room, describes what Jagmeet Singh must do this year to win",2019-01-06 00:24:00,David Climenhaga,,"With a federal election looming this fall, mainstream pundits have already written off the federal New Democratic Party and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, relegating Mr. Singh to history’s discard bin and declaring the party to have already returned to perpetual third-party status.

Maybe they shouldn’t, suggests long-time NDP political strategist and former federal leadership contender Brian Topp in a lengthy article published Friday on social media that so far seems to have been completely ignored by mainstream journalists.

There is a route to victory for the NDP and Mr. Singh in 2019 just as there was for the party led by Jack Layton in 2011, when New Democrats almost grasped the brass ring, Mr. Topp argues in the 2,800-word draft, which he said he has submitted for publication in an upcoming edition of Policy Magazine.

Despite lack of media interest in Mr. Topp’s formula for NDP success later this year, he deserves to be listened to. After all, he’s worthy of constant scathing attacks by Conservative politicians and their media cheerleaders for his recent service as Premier Rachel Notley’s chief of staff. Surely Mr. Topp then is important enough to warrant respectful attention for his strategic pronouncements!

The Quebec-born Mr. Topp has had a pretty distinguished career as an advisor to such progressive politicians as federal NDP Leaders Ed Broadbent and Mr. Layton, Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, and Toronto Mayor David Miller. He ran the election war room for Ms. Notley’s NDP in the May 2015 Alberta election – a success that should counterbalance the spectacular defeat in 2013 of B.C. NDP leader Adrian Dix, in whose campaign Mr. Topp played a similar role.


Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Describing the federal NDP as “a coalition of progressive-minded pragmatists and romantics,” he argues his party must confront both the collapse of “third-way” social democratic role models in the democracies of the West and the “dangerous successor appeal” of populist neo-fascism to working class voters.

Alas for the NDP, he said, the track record of its romantics is “to unhelpfully agitate to make the NDP politically irrelevant and unelectable, and then to implicitly or explicitly argue for the election of the Liberals, since the Conservatives must be stopped.”

And yet, as Mr. Layton proved in the election less than four months before his death in 2011, “when the New Democratic Party finds a way to weave its pragmatic and romantic threads together into something like a coherent offer it can be surprisingly compelling, just when you least expect it.”


Federal NDP leader Jack Layton in 2011, shortly before his death (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

This is especially true, Mr. Topp noted, “when the Liberals have earned a stint in the repair shop, and the Conservatives have made the mistake of letting their real faces show.” As is the case today, one could argue, with the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau and the Conservatives by Andrew Scheer.

“In a campaign likely to be centred on an ugly and possibly uninspiring slanging match between Prime Minister Trudeau and a coalition of unattractive Trumpian provincial Tory Premiers fronted by their federal errand-boy, Mr. Scheer … perhaps there will be another golden opportunity for the New Democrats,” he wrote.

So how might this work, according to Mr. Topp?

Well, not by pretending to be Conservatives, as former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair did with his deficit policy in 2015. (Mr. Topp, who was defeated by Mr. Mulcair in the 2012 NDP leadership campaign that followed Mr. Layton’s death, did not deign to mention Mr. Mulcair by name.)


Former NDP leader Ed Broadbent (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

And not by pretending to be Liberals. “If Canadians want Liberal government they will re-elect Prime Minister Trudeau and his team. Social democratic parties who try to go down this road are being crushed all around the democratic world – losing their core working class voters to populist conservatives.”

And not by ignoring Quebec. “Just as Quebecers (briefly) returned to their 2011 vote after seeing Alberta go orange in 2015, so it is true that voters in Ontario and across Canada are much more likely to support a federal NDP that can plausibly present itself as a national project, that brings French- and English-speaking voters together on a common agenda.” (The inverse is also true, Mr. Topp warned. “It is hard to imagine voters … betting on an NDP federal government if they believe the NDP is about to hand back its Quebec breakthrough.”)


Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

And not by “focusing on the agendas of a kaleidoscope of NGOs and lefter-than-thou showboaters, however well-meaning.” (Avi Lewis, c’mon down!)

Mr. Topp concludes: “Victory will be found here: Working class voters, in both official languages and on both sides of the Rockies, want a raise. They want 40 years of the Revenge of the Rentiers to end. They want the benefits of this economy tilted a little more to their benefit, for the first time in a long while. And they would like to know somebody in Ottawa cares about their jobs, their economic security and the future of their children.”

Since Canadian working families are looking for economic and social justice, if the NDP offers it to them it will probably get their support. “If not, the mini-Trumpians … will give them a way to send the comfortable among us a message.”

There’s a lot more to Mr. Topp’s thoughtful argument than this short précis provides. Readers are urged to give it a look","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">So how might this work, according to Mr. Topp?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Well, not by pretending to be Conservatives, as former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair did with his deficit policy in 2015. (Mr. Topp, who was defeated by Mr. Mulcair in the 2012 NDP leadership campaign that followed Mr. Layton’s death, did not deign to mention Mr. Mulcair by name.)</p>

<p class=""p1"">And not by pretending to be Liberals. “If Canadians want Liberal government they will re-elect Prime Minister Trudeau and his team. Social democratic parties who try to go down this road are being crushed all around the democratic world – losing their core working class voters to populist conservatives.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">And not by ignoring Quebec. “Just as Quebecers (briefly) returned to their 2011 vote after seeing Alberta go orange in 2015, so it is true that voters in Ontario and across Canada are much more likely to support a federal NDP that can plausibly present itself as a national project, that brings French- and English-speaking voters together on a common agenda.” (The inverse is also true, Mr. Topp warned. “It is hard to imagine voters … betting on an NDP federal government if they believe the NDP is about to hand back its Quebec breakthrough.”)</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_28963"" style=""width: 250px;""><img width=""240"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-28963"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-28963"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Mulcair-2-240x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Mulcair-2-240x300.jpg 240w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Mulcair-2-100x125.jpg 100w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Mulcair-2.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-28963"">Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair (Photo: David J.

<p class=""p1"">And not by “focusing on the agendas of a kaleidoscope of NGOs and lefter-than-thou showboaters, however well-meaning.” (Avi Lewis, <i>c’mon down!</i>)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Topp concludes: “Victory will be found here: Working class voters, in both official languages and on both sides of the Rockies, want a raise. They want 40 years of the Revenge of the Rentiers to end. They want the benefits of this economy tilted a little more to their benefit, for the first time in a long while. And they would like to know somebody in Ottawa cares about their jobs, their economic security and the future of their children.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Since Canadian working families are looking for economic and social justice, if the NDP offers it to them it will probably get their support. “If not, the mini-Trumpians … will give them a way to send the comfortable among us a message.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s a lot more to Mr. Topp’s thoughtful argument than this short précis provides. Readers are urged to give it a look.</p>

The promised slow-moving, horn-honking, eastern-bastard-annoying convoy from Alberta was supposed to depart Red Deer on Feb. 15. But Monday afternoon, the self-described “grassroots movement” behind the trans-Canada rolling blockade or whatever it was supposed to be pulled the plug on the entire venture before the trucks even left the depot. The reason? It was “no longer viable.”


Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer in one of his social media pictures that day (Photo: Twitter).

The basis of this alleged lack of viability was not explained, so supporters and skeptics alike are bound to engage in a little harmless speculation and then yell at each other on social media about it. Well, so be it.

Rally 4 Resources, the Red Deer-based group nominally behind the effort, promised Monday to refund anyone who donated to the group’s GoFundMe campaign online.

“This event was planned in response to the overwhelming momentum that’s been building from our resource rallies,” the group said. “Unfortunately, we have come to the decision that it is no longer viable to proceed with our planned convoy.”

So, in the event – or, rather, not in the event, or at least in the non-event – the momentum turned out to be something less than overwhelming. Whatever could have gone wrong?

It’s possible, of course, that the organizers realized the actual number of truckers who would be available to drive all 3,500 kilometres to Ottawa without pulling a load was bound to be seriously underwhelming.

People do want to work, after all, and if you’re a trucker that means you have to be available to pull loads with your truck if you want to make any money.

Others have suggested that the group – which seemed suspiciously closely connected to the Conservative Party of Canada – may have been quietly asked to drop its plans. This theory says Conservative Party of Canada pollsters must have been getting back answers that suggested the potential for a large group of trucks from Alberta creating a nuisance on the highways of Ontario wasn’t going to win any friends for Conservative federal Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer.

After all, the instant a grinning Mr. Scheer just happened to turn up at the huge truck rally that snarled traffic around Edmonton International Airport on Dec. 19, and then made sure his face was plastered all over social media aboard some of the rigs, his name and party were inextricably linked to the convoy’s organizers in the minds of Canadians.

Protesters who were there that day can deny it all they like – and they might even be right – but the idea that the convoy and others like it was in fact organized to bring publicity to Mr. Scheer’s Edmonton visit and embarrass Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now firmly embedded in the public’s consciousness.

If voters outside the Prairies weren’t enamoured of this spectacle, you can certainly see why Mr. Scheer’s strategists might want it to quietly go away.

Unfortunately for Mr. Scheer, a group of so-called “yellow vests” – the people who are giving a bad name across the country to high-visibility fabrics – apparently plans to continue with its own cross-Canada convoy protest.

If they turn out to have the organizational skills to keep their act together and find some trucks for the trip, Mr. Scheer and his party are not only going to be blamed for everything they get up to, but for everything they say.

And given the kind of poisonous garbage some of them have been spewing up to now, that could be very bad for Mr. Scheer. And when he says he has nothing to do with them, lots of voters just aren’t going to believe him.

On to Ottawa? The Conservatives had better hope the story of the still-planned yellow-vest protest also turns out to be a case of no guts, no glory, and, above all, no trucks","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Could there be a more, as the Brits used to say, clueless clot than Andrew Scheer? Viewing him only from the perspective of his public appearances and utterances, I am struck by his dull slow-witted reponses. He has some pre-arranged thing to say, and seems unable to process any change by way of a reporter’s follow-up question – one wonders if he has even understood the query posed. He merely repeats what he’s already said. Not a bright man. Apparently confident that he could have beaten down Trump on NAFTA, or done this and that better than PM Twinkletoes hisself merely by stating as much but without further explanation, he has trouble grasping context and content. He is not quick on his feet, er, brain. Dear oh dear, what a useless waste of time he is for a man occupying the role of Leader of the Opposition. I imagine he is the life of any party, even a social tea. A buzzkill dimbulb. From dull minds come dull policies, and then one is reduced to sloganeering standing in for actual thoughtful reflection. Gronk. Just imagine the scintillating conversation you could have if by some major misfortune, you were stuck alone in a room with him. My definition of cruel and unusual punishment.

So the Alberta good-natured if ill-informed truck convoy is off, but the cunning twisted minds of the Canadian far right who have purloined the yellow vest idea (of the upset against Macron-Neoliberalism-Deluxe regular French folk) for their own nefarious reasons, might do something truculent themselves. Oh joy. Let us raise a cup of good cheer. This hive of white supremacist blaggards, racists, misogynists and xenophobes need to have a territory to themselves – I nominate Ellesmere Island. Trump can come and give lectures to a sell-out crowd, and then demand payment for looking after their defence from China, Russia, the Latin American and Muslim hordes and JT.

Federally, your navel-gazing out-of-touch Jagmeet Singh looks set to sink the NDP. That leaves only the Greens, and Elizabeth May is no dope. Ran into her when she protested our right of way spraying 35 years ago in NS. Was sneakily impressed and thus slowly began my change to being environmentally responsible. She’d roast Scheer’s underperforming neurons for a mid-morning snack with ease and aplomb. So it’s the Greens for me federally from now on, not least because of Notley revealing her true spots and the relentlessly annoying Alberta TV ads of dubious logic polluting our airwaves night and day. Voted NDP for years and for our good MP who got shot down for perhaps touching women inappropriately post his election loss to a Liberal nonentity in 2015, while being the best friend our vets ever had. No reason to vote NDP whatsoever – not a single one.

I have been thinking much the same thing myself about Elizabeth May and the Greens. Living in Alberta, as I do, there is not much hope of the Green Party of Canada even running candidates in most ridings, especially mine, though, so in the absence of some geriatric Communist running on a whim, as used to happen occasionally, I suppose I shall hold my nose and vote NDP anyway.

Well, certainly no brains!
These guys are all Conservative voters, no doubt about that. Both provincially and federally.
That they can’t organise, that they have no coherent strategy, that they have no message beyond personal outrage is not at all surprising for a bunch of Albaturda red-neck right-wing nutjobs; that was Klein’s level of competence and cri de coeur for the duration of his term.
Just another day chuckles and wonderment out on the flats.

Based on the antics of the truckers’ demonstration in Nisku, I assume the plan was to hold up traffic all the way across the country, convinced that will help to make people like the pipeline idea. As I suggested on an earlier post, this is like the bully complaining to his teacher, “I have beat up every kid in my class twice, and still nobody likes me”.

The Rally4Rescources people were adamant that they were not part of the Yellow Vest movement, and that they did not share the odious views some of the YV people have expressed.

Thus the R4R people were trying to attract participants with enough of an obnoxious streak that they were willing to inconvenience people for a prolonged period, but not obnoxious enough to share the Yellow Vest views. Maybe they were just targeting too small a slice of the population.

Enjoy your day!

I think whoever is organizing this has finally figured out that driving around Nisku and tying up traffic to the airport in Edmonton is unlikely to get the attention of those who count in Ottawa. Now I am not sure there is much Ottawa can really do about the current pipeline delays, it seems it is the courts that are dealing with that now. However, I suppose Ottawa does have more powers on this issue than Alberta.

In any event, I think one of the tactics is to put political pressure on Ottawa and see what happens. Driving anywhere around Alberta is unlikely to do that. I doubt the Federal Liberals are expecting to win big here in the upcoming election and even if they lose their few seats here, I am sure they can survive without them. Obviously the protestors need to go to Ontario, however that is not as simple as it sounds. First, it is a long trip and a trucker who is not busy can afford a day or two off to protest, but probably not a week or more. Second, the costs of traveling across Canada, even with an empty truck are not insignificant. Third, they will get noticed if they actually manage to get someone to bankroll their trip to Ontario, but that can be a double edged sword. All it takes is a few of those angry yellow jackets to spout off too much about immigrants or something else not closely related to this issue and all that potential good will in Ontario towards Alberta’s struggling oil workers could dissipate very quickly. If that happens, of course there will also be those pictures of Scheer smiling in the cab of the truck in Nisku to tie him into the extreme and intolerant yellow jacket protestors. As I well know from living in Alberta for many years, don’t get too close to the yellow jackets, they are nasty and will sting you for no reason.

Boy, are you WRONG! About EVERYTHING you said in your article! Why don’t you try living through cold cold Canada winters with solar or wind energy, you FOOL! Try starting your electric car, which will die after 40 kms, as we have seen with so many Teslas! There is an abundance of oil and it does no longer pollute – the factories and our cars are now made to expell no residue – do your research. We are carbon NEGATIVE in Canada!!!! I am SO angry that people like you live comfortable lives with your central heating and gas cars whilst idiots at the Capitol (who are slaves to the EU by the way and are trying to implement Agenda 21, and Agenda 2030 – look them up), to RID us ALL of our freedoms, one by one and the fake global warming story is a big part of brainwashing us to make us feel guilty that we are destroying our planet. DO your research on how clean Canada is. We have so many trillions of trees that we are CARBON NEGATIVE. Meaning that we are in fact HELPING the world’s atmosphere, NOT destroying it at ALL! DO you even CARE about those in Alberta who have been making YOUR life EASY????? If not, you are living in ignorance and complete lack of gratefulness for the riches that we have in Canada, and for those hard-working men and women who get the job done for those of us who work in “office” jobs. I can’t imagine seeing YOU do THEIR work, so SHUT UP, and accept the luxuries that we have here in Canada, a good life compared to most around the globe.

297,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Never mind the facts of Canadian history: Brian Jean says … Make Confederation Great Again,2019-01-17 01:51:00,David Climenhaga,,"If former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean established anything on Monday with his Epistle to the Albertans, wherein he set out his “agenda to move Alberta forward,” it’s that he remains a man desperate to be taken seriously.

Much mocked in circles that no longer take Mr. Jean very seriously at all, if ever they did, his not-entirely-unexpected disquisition on Confederation and Alberta’s place in it nevertheless generated lots of Serious Ink, actual and virtual.


Mr. Jean and his wife, Kimberly Michelutti, announce they’re going to have a baby (Photo: Twitter).

In his screed, definitely meant to be taken seriously, the man on horseback from Fort McMurray proclaimed that “Canada is broken” and “Albertans are furious.” These are the sort of claims journalists love to repeat, even if they are contentious and their motivation tendentious.

I suppose we can agree some Albertans are furious. This has always been true as long as I’ve lived here, which is getting to be a very long time indeed. Perhaps it’s something in the water, although probably not in our constitutional arrangements with the rest of Canada, which for most of that time have been very much to Alberta’s advantage.

It is also true there’s an elite political consensus in this province that the country isn’t working the way it ought to, that is, that our leaders are not getting everything they want the instant they want it. But since other Canadians don’t necessarily or always want the same things Alberta’s leaders do, one could argue that’s evidence the country is working the way it should.

When a group of social media savvy Albertans who are not furious cooked up the ironic Twitter hash tag #NotAngryAB in response to Mr. Jean’s musings, that just made the citizens of the Principality of Angry Alberta angrier, to mainly comedic effect.

This can’t have been an entirely happy outcome for a man who had just informed us “Alberta’s future looks bleak unless bold action is taken” – that is, unless we Albertans swallow the prescription he has issued for us, to wit, to start acting like Quebec separatists, demand the Canadian constitution be renegotiated to our advantage, and, while we’re at it, recognize we have no better leader than Brian Jean. Still, better to be spoken of badly than not to be spoken of at all!

Mr. Jean made the first two propositions explicitly in his essay. As for the third, that’s implied but pretty obvious. He’s telling us he’s the only person who can, in his words, “return Canada to the original spirit of Confederation.”

The only problem with Mr. Jean’s convenient declaration that “our country is not working the way it was intended in 1867” as a starting point for his prescription for the future is that it is a profound misinterpretation of the reasons Canada was created, and the federal form it took.

It is simply not true, as Mr. Jean contends, that “the original constitution was essentially a business deal guaranteeing free trade and free passage of goods between and through our provinces, to bring prosperity to all Canadians.” This is an ideological fantasy with shallow roots in the late 20th Century.

Indeed, Alberta was part of the Northwest Territories, entirely under federal jurisdiction, until 1905, and did not receive full control over its natural resources until 1930.

Confederation was a 19th Century British Imperial project to strategically block the United States from the western half of British North America at an affordable cost that would be largely borne by citizens of the new country. It was also intended to meld badly functioning colonial governments like that in the former Upper Canada into a system that would be stable, and to break the historic deadlock between French and English Canada.


Mr. Jean addresses the Albertans: I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it any more! Actual Alberta politicians may not appear exactly as illustrated (Photo: Screenshot from Network, 1976).

Notwithstanding the horrible example of the American Civil War, still fresh in everyone’s memory in 1867, it took the form of a federation to ensure it could be accepted by the French-speaking colonists of what is now Quebec and long-established English-speaking colonists on the East Coast.

Free passage of goods among provinces was an afterthought at best, although it would get there in the fullness of time with the construction of railroads westward.

It is true our Canadian federation was structured to avoid the worst features of the United States’ slaveholder constitution – which led to the Civil War. So Mr. Jean is partly right when he says our original constitution – the British North America Act, passed by the Parliament at Westminster – “envisioned a central government making the ultimate political decision to declare a project to be in the national interest and thus override regional objections.”

But to suggest Canada could or should return to a near-unitary government able if inclined to enforce the decisions Alberta wants (and presumably only the decisions Alberta wants) is dangerous nonsense that ignores a century and a half of Canadian constitutional jurisprudence.

In our nearly 152 years, Canada has gone from being a highly centralized federation dominated by Ottawa to one of the most decentralized federal unions in the world. The ship Mr. Jean so fondly remembers sailed long, long ago.

Nor would bringing it back to port be good for Alberta, which inevitably would sooner or later be overruled by the majority on policies that matter to it. If anyone was suggesting this seriously, Albertans would fight it tooth and nail – and we would have allies in most other provinces.

Mr. Jean has to understand this stuff. He may be being a dope, but he’s not a dummy. He’s a lawyer, for heaven’s sake!

So what’s up? One can only speculate, of course, but consider the position he finds himself in.

Here it is, 2019, about the time he’d been hoping to be getting ready to take hold of the reins of Alberta’s government. Instead he’s a man without a party to lead or a political role to fulfill.

He’s not exactly a spring chicken at 55, but he and his second wife Kimberly Michelutti, whom he married in 2017, have just declared that they’re about to have a baby. Funny how his idea that “the marriage between Alberta and the rest of Canada is deeply troubled” seemed like an appropriate metaphor.

And recent polling suggests the aggressive advertising campaign by Alberta’s current NDP Government led by Premier Rachel Notley may in fact be working, moving Canadians in most places toward viewing a pipeline as a national necessity, just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also says it is.

Mr. Jean’s rival in the conservative movement – now the leader of the United Conservative Party – is a former federal politician who apparently still casts covetous eyes at the Prime Minister’s Office, just down the street from the half-million-dollar condo he bought in 2009 with a little help from taxpayers.

So, who knows, there might be a job opening in Edmonton soon. And if that doesn’t work, there’s always the “‘Mad As Hell’ Party, that isn’t going to take it any more.”

So never mind the facts of history. What better way to set yourself apart from all those other little conservatives clamouring for the brass ring than to have a slogan concise enough to stitch on a ball cap: “Make Confederation Great Again.”","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">When a group of social media savvy Albertans who are <i>not</i> furious cooked up the ironic Twitter hash tag #NotAngryAB in response to Mr. Jean’s musings, that just made the citizens of the Principality of Angry Alberta angrier, to mainly comedic effect.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This can’t have been an entirely happy outcome for a man who had just informed us “Alberta’s future looks bleak unless bold action is taken” – that is, unless we Albertans swallow the prescription he has issued for us, to wit, to start acting like Quebec separatists, demand the Canadian constitution be renegotiated to our advantage, and, while we’re at it, recognize we have no better leader than Brian Jean. Still, better to be spoken of badly than not to be spoken of at all!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Jean made the first two propositions explicitly in his essay. As for the third, that’s implied but pretty obvious. He’s telling us he’s the only person who can, in his words, <i>“return Canada to the original spirit of Confederation.”</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">The only problem with Mr. Jean’s convenient declaration that “our country is not working the way it was intended in 1867” as a starting point for his prescription for the future is that it is a profound misinterpretation of the reasons Canada was created, and the federal form it took.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is simply not true, as Mr. Jean contends, that “the original constitution was essentially a business deal guaranteeing free trade and free passage of goods between and through our provinces, to bring prosperity to all Canadians.” This is an ideological fantasy with shallow roots in the late 20<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
<p>Indeed, Alberta was part of the Northwest Territories, entirely under federal jurisdiction, until 1905, and did not receive full control over its natural resources until 1930.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Confederation was a 19<sup>th</sup> Century British Imperial project to strategically block the United States from the western half of British North America at an affordable cost that would be largely borne by citizens of the new country. It was also intended to meld badly functioning colonial governments like that in the former Upper Canada into a system that would be stable, and to break the historic deadlock between French and English Canada.</p>

Actual Alberta politicians may not appear exactly as illustrated (Photo: Screenshot from Network, 1976).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Notwithstanding the horrible example of the American Civil War, still fresh in everyone’s memory in 1867, it took the form of a federation to ensure it could be accepted by the French-speaking colonists of what is now Quebec and long-established English-speaking colonists on the East Coast.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Free passage of goods among provinces was an afterthought at best, although it would get there in the fullness of time with the construction of railroads westward.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is true our Canadian federation was structured to avoid the worst features of the United States’ slaveholder constitution – which led to the Civil War. So Mr. Jean is partly right when he says our original constitution – the British North America Act, passed by the Parliament at Westminster – “envisioned a central government making the ultimate political decision to declare a project to be in the national interest and thus override regional objections.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">But to suggest Canada could or should return to a near-unitary government able if inclined to enforce the decisions Alberta wants (and presumably <i>only</i> the decisions <i>Alberta </i>wants) is dangerous nonsense that ignores a century and a half of Canadian constitutional jurisprudence.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In our nearly 152 years, Canada has gone from being a highly centralized federation dominated by Ottawa to one of the most decentralized federal unions in the world. The ship Mr. Jean so fondly remembers sailed long, long ago.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Nor would bringing it back to port be good for Alberta, which inevitably would sooner or later be overruled by the majority on policies that matter to it. If anyone was suggesting this seriously, Albertans would fight it tooth and nail – and we would have allies in most other provinces.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Jean has to understand this stuff. He may be being a dope, but he’s not a dummy. He’s a <i>lawyer,</i> for heaven’s sake!</p>
<p class=""p1"">So what’s up? One can only speculate, of course, but consider the position he finds himself in.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Here it is, 2019, about the time he’d been hoping to be getting ready to take hold of the reins of Alberta’s government. Instead he’s a man without a party to lead or a political role to fulfill.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">He’s not exactly a spring chicken at 55, but he and his second wife Kimberly </span>Michelutti, whom he married in 2017, have <a href=""https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/01/this-just-in-no-province-wide-gender-reveal-party-to-be-required-for-baby-jean/"">just declared</a> that they’re about to have a baby. Funny how his idea that “the marriage between Alberta and the rest of Canada is deeply troubled” seemed like an appropriate metaphor.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pipeline-capacity-poll-1.4979805"">recent polling suggests</a> the aggressive advertising campaign by Alberta’s current NDP Government led by Premier Rachel Notley may in fact be working, moving Canadians in most places toward viewing a pipeline as a national necessity, just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also says it is.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Jean’s rival in the conservative movement – now the leader of the United Conservative Party – is a former federal politician who apparently still casts covetous eyes at the Prime Minister’s Office, just down the street from <a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/90759/parliamentary-perk-subsidizes-mps-entry-into-ottawa-housing-market/"">the half-million-dollar condo he bought in 2009</a> with a little help from taxpayers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, who knows, there might be a job opening in Edmonton soon. And if that doesn’t work, there’s always the “‘<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMBZDwf9dok"">Mad As Hell</a>’ Party, that isn’t going to take it any more.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">So never mind the facts of history. What better way to set yourself apart from all those other little conservatives clamouring for the brass ring than to have a slogan concise enough to stitch on a ball cap: <i>“Make Confederation Great Again.”</i></p>

Very good post.

I believe Mr Jean is originally from BC. Perhaps we can attribute his lack of Canadian history knowledge to the schooling there – we got a lot of it banged into our heads in high school in NS in the early sixties. And submitted a flag design to replace the old ensign in Pearson’s contest. We were proud to be Canadian.

There seems in recent years to be a quite large number of people originally from outside the province who have taken up the cudgel to advance what they see as Alberta’s interests. They all seem a bit light on facts, preferring to retrieve opinion from their memories rather than facts from official sources. One thinks of Jason Kenney who forgets he was responsible for the last equalization formula update in 2007 under Harper, and which was Alberta-friendly because it threw away half the royalty income from resources when it came to calculating provincial government revenue. Misremembering facts accidentally on purpose seems a common Conservative characteristic of late. It helps them to bamboozle the public.

You could have knocked me over with a feather to learn Mr Jean is a lawyer. Lawyers tend to be somewhat adept at looking up precedents when formulating cases for clients. Apparently this tendency to refer to facts professionally is abandoned when it comes to politics for Mr Jean when any old hearsay and prejudice will do do the job better. His CBC TV phone interview rant before Christmas convinced me that he was a rural convenience store owner howling at overbearing government regulations, and lacking in basic interview skills. When they finally slowly turned the volume and let him go he was still talking. Embarrassing for him. There’s nobody more passionate than someone who feels they’re hard done by, even if they’re full of it from beginning to end.

Mr. Jean was born in B.C., but moved to Alberta before he was of age to attend kindergarten, so we Albertans will have to take the rap for most of the flaws in his education. He went to law school in Australia and prepped to practice in Canada at the University of Calgary. DJC

Don’t be so fast to kick Brian Jean to the curb folks.

In my humble opinion, Jean realizes, as all shrewd political piranhas do, that Jason Kenney’s political luster and relevance is beginning to wane with Lougheed-like conservatives. With the steady drip, drip, of UCP desertions (combined reams of negative press) Jean is merely biding his time until the “Kenney Saves Alberta” reclamation project falls flat on its face this election cycle.

After being conned, politically eviscerated and stabbed in the back by Kenney during the PC/Wildrose merger and UCP leadership race, Jean is licking his chops. Expect more profound angry missives from Mr. Jean as the election cycle heats up. Then brace for the aftermath — a sure-fire bloodletting if Kenney loses to Rachel Notley and the NDP in the forthcoming.

I suppose Mr. Jean actually does have some things to be angry about. For instance, lets start with the fact not so long ago he was happily the leader of the official opposition and anticipating becoming Premier of Alberta, that is until his leadership and party were stolen, yes stolen from him. I suppose that in itself is enough to make someone go a bit off. This sort of reminds me of Nancy McBeth and her videos with horses around election time years ago. Perhaps horses are the western equivalent of man’s or woman’s best friend and they don’t betray you or stab you in the back like say certain other Conservative people.

Speaking of Conservative people, current UCP leader Kenney is certainly a very talented political organizer, who seems to have learned how to silence and control his party from his former Federal leader, but I am not sure strategy is his strongest point. There is an old saying about keeping your friends close, but your enemies closer. Kenney seems to have banished or exiled a growing number of his former opponents and others from UCP la la land. Right now there are a lot of free range Conservatives out there and I am not sure they are helpful to Kenney, when even like Jean they might appear to be innocuous. As a politician, Kenney has seemed fairly skilled at channeling anger, but with one little video Jean seems to now have turned some Albertans into mocking this sort of anger.

I am not sure Kenney is really much looking forward to Jean’s next public foray, but I have a feeling other Albertans are. At the least it might be entertaining, and whether intended or not, might provide us with a respite from all the recent overly manufactured and calculated political anger.

One of the principal drivers of Confederation was concern amongst leaders of what were then the British North American colonies about a new expansionist mood in the United States after the end of the Civil War. Canada in the 18th & 19th centuries was somewhat of an affront to the US. Let’s not forget: one of the key milestones in Canada’s Constitutional history, the Quebec Act of 1774, was in fact among the so-called “Intolerable Acts” that led directly to the American Revolution. Later, in 1812, the US invaded the Canadian colonies, partly in retaliation for heavy-handed British actions in support of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. In addition, during the Civil War, many Canadians actually supported the Confederacy, not because of slavery, but because a Confederate victory would weaken the United States https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/american-civil-war.

As to the decentralization of Canadian governance, most of that occurred in the early years of our history, when jurisdictional disputes between the federal & provincial governments were appealed to what was then the highest Court: the (UK) Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in London. The Judicial Committee’s decisions eventually drew sharper boundaries around federal authority than had been anticipated by the drafters of the original BNA Act. (The Supreme Court of Canada didn’t become Canada’s Court of last resort until 1933 for criminal appeals, and 1949 for other cases). One of the legacies of this history is the inability of a federal government to impose its will on a province, which is what would be needed to push a pipeline through its territory over provincial objections. And for those nutjobs yelling “notwithstanding clause”, that has nothing to do with this legal history, which long predates the 1982 Constitution Act & the Charter.

I speak, of course, of the recently rebranded Freedom Conservative Party leader’s Hestonesque Twitter outburst yesterday in response to talk the federal Liberal government might actually make an election issue out of banning handguns.


Canadian Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair (Photo: bblair.liberal.ca).

The handgun ban balloon was floated by federal Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair during the Trudeau Government’s cabinet retreat in Sherbrooke, Que. This suggests the Liberals have done some polling and concluded the eminently sensible idea is one on which they could campaign and win in Canada’s big cities if not in rural settings like Mr. Fildebrandt’s Strathmore-Brooks provincial riding.

In addition to being a famous American actor who played both John the Baptist and Ben Hur in his long screen career, Mr. Heston led the National Rifle Association for six years before stepping down and succumbing to Alzheimer’s disease. When he announced his retirement from the NRA in 2003, he famously concluded with a cry of “from my cold dead hands.” Everyone in the room knew what he meant.

Mr. Fildebrandt – a shrewd if not a careful politician, once a rising star in the Wildrose and United Conservative parties before exchanging fire with two leaders, one of whom turned out to be a better shot than he was – didn’t go quite as far as the late NRA president.

But if the Liberals dare to ban handguns, he Tweeted defiantly, “no matter what the feds do, they will never get their hands on mine.”

This set off a predictable Twitter storm over gun control, which no doubt pleased Mr. Fildebrandt, who faces the daunting task of seeking re-election in a rural riding without the support of the well-financed Conservative party he was once part of – having been sent packing a year ago by UCP Leader Jason Kenney after a series of unfortunate events.

The gun debate, of course, is a bore, no pun intended, which works for the advocates of unrestricted U.S. style gun ownership since any reasonable person succumbs to weariness as they go on and on with their fatuous statistics.


Freedom Conservative Party Leader Derek Fildebrandt channeling Charlton Heston in happier times (Photo: Facebook).

What’s interesting to me about Mr. Fildebrandt’s latest outburst, though, is its inconsistency with other things he has said in the past.

After all, it’s perfectly reasonable for a law-abiding gun owner, particularly one who is an elected lawmaker, to strenuously oppose any piece of legislation, no matter how sensible. What is not so reasonable is to vow in advance to defy the law if it’s passed as if the rules simply don’t apply to him, either because he just doesn’t feel like obeying them, or because he doesn’t think they apply to libertarian conservatives.

Mr. Fildebrandt, clearly, doesn’t feel this way about all law breaking.

Last fall, when tout le monde political Alberta was deeply obsessed with pipeline protesters in British Columbia, Mr. Fildebrandt excoriated what he called “a cowardly political elite that is not willing to use the police force necessary to protect private property and the rule of law.”

In an interview with a local news website in Strathmore, he went on to call on Premier Rachel Notley to “use appropriate police force necessary to clear out illegal protesters who are squatting on private land and making a mockery of the rule of law.”

It was not immediately clear how she was supposed to do this, as she is the premier of Alberta and the illegal squatters, since departed, were in British Columbia. But his key point was that, under the rule of law, all citizens must obey the law, or be dealt with accordingly.

Now we see, on a matter dear to his heart or the hearts of his constituents, the rule of law is of no consequence whatsoever. Indeed, he could be said to be advocating making a mockery of the law.

Of course, there is a pattern here. Among the things that got Mr. Fildebrandt in trouble with his former friend Mr. Kenney was his failure to remain at the scene of an accident as required by law and his act of shooting a deer on private land as forbidden by law.

This suggests a lack of concern for the rule of law – except when enforcement of a law is in what Mr. Fildebrandt views as being his interests. It is reasonable, given this evidence, not to take him very seriously.

On the other hand, as has been observed here before, it rather puts him in the mainstream as utopian market fundamentalist ideologues go when it comes to questions of the rule of law – to wit, it’s for you, and not for them.

As for the likelihood of the Liberals actually moving forward on a handgun ban, I am sorry to say I suspect their enthusiasm for this idea will wane once they have been successfully reelected. But if handguns are by some miracle banned, one hopes for his own safety that Mr. Fildebrandt reconsiders his defiance!

It is ironic that the success of the pro-gun lobby in attacking and undermining the so-called long-gun registry really created the political conditions that make it possible to talk now of outright bans.

In the meantime, should he lose to the UCP as expected in the forthcoming spring Alberta provincial election, the renegade MLA will have already auditioned for a local production one of Mr. Heston’s most famous roles, that of Moses leading the Children of Alberta into the wilderness as a candidate for Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada.

After that, I suppose, the former Canadian Taxpayers Federation agitator will have to return to his native Ontario and seek work with a right-wing think tank or Astro-Turf group","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

What Derek does’t realize, is that such a law would neutralize his handgun even if he didn’t turn it in. He would have to keep it hidden so noone saw it. Who could he trust in politics. He could never take it anywhere : if he was stopped by the cops they might find it. He could not use it to threaten a burglar because although the threat might not lead to a charge his illegal gun would be confiscated anyway.

David really is one of my favorite fiction writers in the province because of how seamlessly he can build a big story from facts that, at first glance, seem related and cogent.

But the idea that laws are worth breaking only if one considers them personally disadvantageous to follow them is somewhat undermined by the two incidents Mr. Climenhaga references:
If you believe that laws are unjust when they inconvenience you, why did Mister Fildebrandt plead guilty to the improper kill, detail that he had made it inadvertently, and list how he was changing his behavior to ensure that he did not violate the law again.

With respect to the hit-and-run on a parked vehicle with no occupants, Mister Fildebrandt maintains his innocence.

I can’t wait until David comes back with an explanation that presumes bad faith of Mr. Fildebrandt harder than he presumes Good Faith with respect to the Notleycrats in response to the perfect storm of structural denial of reproductive freedom and reinforcement of assigned identity happening to Albertan trans women.

One could be forgiven for wondering why this sexist propagandist who lets trans women die of a queer health crisis of choice instead of writing about how this government ignores the Alberta Human Rights Act when it doesn’t personally benefit their middle-aged, bigoted, credential-class, cisfeminist base to do so… but it will probably be as likely to come as self-reflection at the sneer of an entitled Albertan to a migrant worker to go back to where he came from.

Mr. Climenhaga, I was born at the Royal Alex, and I’ve lived in Edmonton all but one year of my life, and it’s statements like that that make me ashamed to be an Albertan. Ontarians can become Albertans, and Mr. Fildebrandt, despite his many flaws, is most-definitely an Albertan, and to treat him as a tourist is beneath even you.

While our host did not mention Fildebrandt’s continued protestations of innocence in the driving case or his guilty plea in the hunting charges, he has done so numerous times in the past. There must be a point at which such facts can be considered generally known and acknowledged. In the former case, Fildebrandt was found guilty by a court of law and that should be good enough for the record. As an accused, he had plenty of opportunity to produce witnesses from the meeting he claimed to be attending at the time of the incident and he did not. His claims do not seem credible to me. I’m not sure how a guilty plea suggests he was not guilty. Again, he claims not to have known he was on private land. If he was concerned about the rule of law and not the chase he would have paid attention. As for cisfeminism, I have no thoughts on that matter.

“If you believe that laws are unjust when they inconvenience you, why did Mister Fildebrandt plead guilty to the improper kill, detail that he had made it inadvertently, and list how he was changing his behavior to ensure that he did not violate the law again.”(sic)

Is it because he got caught?

Can we listen up in Alberta? Like some other noteworthy Ontario ex-pats, this guy made and dresses himself up in what he presumed to be your image. He’s yours. Please don’t stop feeding him and find something that will keep him occupied.

Eventually Jason Kenney and his posse will catch up with the outlaw Derek Fildebrandt and he’ll likely go down with both guns blazing.

Sadly, the federal Liberals don’t have a very good track record on sensible gun control. The initial impetus for the long-gun registry arose out of the aftermath of the École Polytechnique shooting in December 1989, in which 14 women were murdered for no reason except that they were female Engineering students … the end of this year will be the 30th anniversary of that tragic event.

Amidst calls for stricter gun control in Canada, the Chrétien Liberals eventually created the National Firearms Registry. But its implementation was so bloated and riddled with cost overruns, opposition to the registry extended far beyond the usual suspects in pro-gun nuttery, and it was eventually killed off by the HarperCons as one of their first acts upon winning a majority government in 2011. So now, thanks to Liberal incompetence, we are left with a situation in Canada where we register our motor vehicles, our bikes in many municipalities, our pets in most … but not our firearms if we own them.

As for handguns, in my view, they have no place in civil society outside of law enforcement and the military. They have no legitimate sporting purpose, being best suited to killing people, not game animals. We should completely denormalize handguns in Canada. I would even go so far as to say that in my view, Canada should abolish shooting sports involving handguns, and no longer participate in handgun shooting sports at international competitions like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. As for those who say, “if we make handguns illegal, only criminals will have them”, my answer is: if handguns are illegal, where would criminals get them, if they can’t steal them or illegally buy them from legal dealers and owners? (Current data suggest that smuggling over the US-Canada border is no longer the major source of illegal handguns: this has been overtaken by theft and unlawful diversion from legal owners in Canada; https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/guns-domestic-danforth-shooting-toronto-1.4759159). Completely ban handguns, and even though criminals may still get their hands on them at first, eventually they will be harder and harder to obtain. Bring in enhanced sentencing for crimes involving firearms: double the maximum time of imprisonment if an illegally-possessed firearm is involved, and implement a national handgun buyback programme—no questions asked—to cull the supply of handguns circulating in society.

It’s a given that Alberta has to respect Canada’s law because our borders aren’t as protected as Canada-USA borders. An Independent Alberta as its own Country may have to respect Canada’s gun laws. It’s an important consideration, but Provinces vary on a lot of laws. But, for a wealthy Country that believes in gaining advanced technology, perhaps tagging handguns owned by Albertan’s with computers or with technology is more towards our futuristic goals then some antiquated politics that’re destined for failure. Mr. Fidebrandt may be as confused as the rest of us about such expensive antiquated gun laws used for a big political pushes as premature. Alberta would be more than willing to enforce strict control on expats in Alberta Country. As why they’d sneak a handgun into Alberta, only extensive psychological testing could give any real answers.

294,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Will Canadian Taxpayers Federation credibility suffer from fine for failing to register as third-party election advertiser,2019-01-20 01:04:00,David Climenhaga,,"The $6,000 administrative penalty levied against the Canadian Taxpayers Federation for failing to register as a third-party advertiser under Alberta’s election financing law is a long-overdue official recognition of the true role the self-described “tax watchdog” plays in Canadian politics.

The CTF has been disproportionately influential in Canadian political discourse for many years, mainly because mainstream media treat its pronouncements as if they were highly credible.


Canadian Taxpayers Federation President and CEO Scott Hennig in 2013 when he was the organization’s Alberta Director (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

So the $6,000 Question, as it were, is whether this development will make media more cautious about acting as if CTF claims come from an unbiased and disinterested source?

Alberta’s Office of the Election Commissioner, which is truly a non-partisan entity, published notice of the fine but did not describe the advertisement that brought the CTF to its attention.

Nor did CTF President and CEO Scott Hennig when he responded to my email about this matter yesterday morning. However, Mr. Hennig did say he will be “shopping around” a newspaper op-ed on the development tomorrow, “after it’s been vetted by our lawyers.”


United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, a former president and CEO of the CTF (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

While the CTF will obviously use the op-ed to make its own case – the organization’s usual, and usually successful, modus operandi – it’s possible there will be additional information in the article to help us understand why officials on Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson’s staff reached the conclusion the CTF was doing third-party election advertising.

It may have been the billboard shown on the CTF’s Facebook page, which reads, “You can’t buy ‘social license’ when it’s not for sale,” asks readers to visit a website called ScrapTheCarbonTax.ca, and shows the CTF logo.

This might come under the definition of election advertising by third parties in the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act: “…The transmission to the public by any means during an election advertising period of an advertising message that promotes or opposes a registered party or the election of a registered candidate, including an advertising message that takes a position on an issue with which a registered party or registered candidate is associated. …”

The Act goes on to list a number of exceptions, such as news reports and commentaries, books, corporate communications to employees or shareholders, telephone calls to electors urging them to vote, and government advertising.

Mr. Hennig did not address my question about whether the CTF plans to appeal the ruling. The OEC notice only said the fine was levied on Jan. 8 and that it has not yet been paid.

The CTF insists it is not partisan, which in a technical sense is true. It does not openly advocate for any political party by name.

Nevertheless, the CTF is as a practical matter part of the strategic infrastructure of the Conservative Party of Canada and the federal party’s increasingly closely tied provincial branches operating under a variety of names.

Indeed, the CTF is something of a farm team for candidates and party officials of the CPC and its provincial chapters. Prominent examples in Alberta are United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney and Freedom Conservative Party Leader Derek Fildebrandt.

Mr. Kenney is a former president and CEO of the organization – indeed, that position would appear to be the closest thing to what most of us would call a real job that the career politician has held.

Mr. Fildebrandt was the CTF’s Alberta director until he left suddenly in late 2014 soon after it was revealed he was considering running for the Wildrose Party. However, the actual reason for his departure was never made clear.

Regardless, by design or coincidence, the CTF plays a key role in CPC and provincial Conservative messaging by reinforcing their utopian market fundamentalist talking points, producing research that supports conservative objectives, and organizing signing ceremonies at which Conservative politicians publicly pledge to carry out policies endorsed by the organization.


Progress Alberta Director Duncan Kinney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Duncan Kinney, director of Progress Alberta, a progressive group that is registered as a third-party election advertiser, wondered in a series of Tweets yesterday if the impact of the fine by a non-parisan government agency “might be a fatal blow to the credibility of the CTF.”

Describing the CTF as “an organization that was already teetering on the edge of irrelevancy,” Mr. Kinney asked: “Will the media still call them for canned quotes on why taxes are bad?”

In another Tweet, Mr. Kinney observed that “the CTF seems almost quaint now. They’ve been overtaken by much more reactionary right wing groups and organizations. …”

One of those, of course, is the Rebel Media video blog, which faces a similar $5,500 fine from the OEC according to multiple news reports based on Rebel Media’s numerous noisy complaints. No one thinks Rebel Media is a credible source of information, however, so its howls of protest and threats of legal action that are being so heavily covered by mainstream media, which is seldom able to resist an easy story, need not be considered at length here.

Organizations that complete Elections Alberta’s simple registration process and post regular disclosures may spend up to $150,000 on advertising before the election writ is dropped and another $150,000 between the time the writ is dropped and the vote","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

It seems Rebel Media has also caught the eye of Mr. Gibson, and might also be fined

While I love the idea of Rebel Media getting any kind of comeuppance, I am sure Ezra will use the event to inflame his sheep, and will probably come out of the issue financially ahead.

I am sure the right wing commentators will point out that Lorne Gibson is an NDP hire, and so can’t be trusted. In truth, Mr. Gibson was originally hired by the PCs in 2006 as the chief electoral officer. Gibson was then fired in 2009 by the same PCs when they realized he wasn’t willing to be a PC team player.

The usual array of conservative suspects trying to skirt the Third Party Advertiser law is not surprising. What is surprising however, is why Postmedia and Alberta broadcast media outlets (radio & TV) still utilize some of these partisan Astro-Turfers as credible sources for comment on everything from the economy to debate on social issues?

Funding disclosure under the law requires TPAs to disclose their donors. Could it be that these Astro-Turf groups, who are known to hide their donor lists, object to revealing their funding sources — such as the corporations and conservative political parties that donate to fund their partisan activities? Are they hiding something?

One other area that concerns me as a voter is election/party polling. My concern is the use of pollsters who are attached to political parties that offer veiled partisan takes to the media, while serving as political operatives who may be paid to cherry-pick survey respondents and embellish skewed data. Alberta needs legislation, perhaps under the TPA, to regulate how these questionable polls are conducted, who conducts them (full transparency) and how the information is disseminated. Election polling has become so suspect in recent years — it’s time to examine this aspect of democracy as well.

291,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,The best solution to gun violence actually possible in Canada in 2019 is an outright ban on handguns,2019-01-23 01:13:00,David Climenhaga,,"Scream as they might about the idea of a ban on handgun ownership by Canadians, it is interesting to note that the tactics used by advocates of wide-open ownership of firearms against the so-called long-gun registry combined with the legislative strategy pursued by their allies in the Conservative federal government during its decade in power opened the political space that now makes it possible to consider outright bans.

Last week it was reported that federal Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair had floated the idea of such a ban on handguns after a retreat by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet in Sherbrooke, Que.


Federal Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair (Photo: bblair.liberal.ca).

In its coverage of Mr. Blair’s hint, the CBC reported that whatever he has come up with is based on several months of consultations about “ways to restrict access to firearms for gang members and other criminals” with stakeholders in all parts of Canada.

Of course, since there is no way to escape the potential for gun violence in a society that encourages widespread gun ownership and includes a fanatical cadre of advocates who see owning firearms as a fundamental right, we are all stakeholders whether we like it or not.

And even if we disagree about the best way to deal with the problem, it is hard not to concede that there is a problem with handgun possession and crime in Canada’s big cities. Fortunately, since Canada’s constitutional history is quite different from that of the United States, there are no constitutional barriers to finding effective solutions to the problem of gun violence.

Readers will recall that when the Liberal Government of prime minister Jean Chretien created the so-called long-gun registry in 1995, there were howls of protest and organized resistance from gun-ownership advocacy groups that modelled themselves on the U.S. National Rifle Association.

Despite a significant reduction in the number of deaths by rifles and shotguns in the years after the establishment of the registry, advocates of wide-open gun ownership portrayed it as an unjustified attack on law-abiding gun owners, a phrase used so often it has come to be abbreviated as LAGOs.

Many of these groups advocated tactics of foot-dragging, non-compliance and outright defiance of the registration requirements.

The Conservative Party of Canada under Stephen Harper seized on this as a good wedge issue in rural regions that might otherwise vote NDP, such as Northern Ontario, and suburban redoubts tempted to vote Liberal.

The Conservatives were abetted in this by the scandalous cost of the registry, about which the Liberals were rightly excoriated. However, that cost arguably made the waste worse when the Harper Government not only shut down the registry soon after it won a majority in the 2011 federal election but ordered, to the horror of most police forces including the one then led by Mr. Blair, that its records be destroyed.

Gun advocates celebrated what seemed to be a decisive victory for them.


St. Albert-Edmonton MP Michael Cooper (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Since then, advocates of unrestricted gun ownership continue to use the same tactics – for example, telling long-gun owners to delay registering their weapons with Quebec’s new provincial long-gun registry. And so do the Conservatives – just days ago I received a flyer from my St. Albert-Edmonton MP, Conservative Michael Cooper, complaining tautologically that “when it comes to gun crime, law-abiding firearms owners are not the problem.”

What the Conservatives and the gun advocates may not have yet noticed since their legislative victory in 2012, though, is that the times they are a’changin’, at least as far as gun-safety laws go. Since then – for whatever reasons, and naturally there is plenty of disagreement about that – gun violence particularly involving handguns has come to be perceived by the public as a serious problem in Canada’s big cities. There is an appetite for action.

And this is where the sad story of the long-gun registry – and particularly the vandalistic destruction by Mr. Harper’s government of the data collected in it, regardless of the cost of the database – becomes relevant to the question of how to solve the problem of violence perpetrated with handguns in Canada.

An argument could certainly be made that the problems associated with handgun ownership in big cities could be eased or even solved through more stringent regulation, better registries, regulated storage sites, and so on.

But we know from practical experience with the long-gun registry that some gun advocates will go to any length to undermine such laws, and they will be aided and abetted by the Conservative Party of Canada, which if elected again would undo whatever has been achieved in order to satisfy its Americanized, red-meat base.

This opens the door, thinking practically, to more radical solutions: to wit, an outright ban on handguns that will sweep up large numbers of such weapons, with penalties severe enough to make even defiant gun owners think twice about hiding them around their residences.

Even if a future Conservative government were to undo such a ban, short of a national program to give away pistols it would be hard for them to restore the numbers of handguns to the country that had been taken off the streets by such a powerful measure.

So the success of the wannabe NRAs of Canada and their allies in the Conservative Party could be their undoing if the Trudeau Government has the courage to follow through on a handgun ban – about which, as noted here earlier, I am pessimistic.

Gun advocates and Conservatives will argue that a ban is not the best of all possible solutions, and in an ideal world, that might be true.

But since their base position is wide-open ownership – which inevitably means more guns in the hands of criminals as well as LAGOs, and more LAGOs who instantly turn into criminals with the pull of a trigger – the best of all possible solutions, whatever it might be, is simply not possible.

The best solution to gun violence that is actually possible in Canada in 2019 is an outright ban on handguns. The longer it lasts, even if it is eventually undone, the more good it will do.

<p class=""p1"">In its coverage of Mr. Blair’s hint, <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/blair-guns-ban-legislation-1.4983849"">the CBC reported</a> that whatever he has come up with is based on several months of consultations about “<span class=""s1"">ways to restrict access to firearms for gang members and other criminals” </span>with <i>stakeholders</i> in all parts of Canada.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, since there is no way to escape the potential for gun violence in a society that encourages widespread gun ownership and includes a fanatical cadre of advocates who see owning firearms as a fundamental right, we are <i>all</i> stakeholders whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And even if we disagree about the best way to deal with the problem, it is hard not to concede that there is a problem with handgun possession and crime in Canada’s big cities. Fortunately, since Canada’s constitutional history is quite different from that of the United States, there are no constitutional barriers to finding effective solutions to the problem of gun violence.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Readers will recall that when the Liberal Government of prime minister Jean Chretien created the so-called long-gun registry in 1995, there were howls of protest and organized resistance from gun-ownership advocacy groups that modelled themselves on the U.S. National Rifle Association.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/scrapping-the-long-gun-registry-some-relevant-numbers-1.861912"">a significant reduction in the number of deaths by rifles and shotguns</a> in the years after the establishment of the registry, advocates of wide-open gun ownership portrayed it as an unjustified attack on law-abiding gun owners, a phrase used so often it has come to be abbreviated as LAGOs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Many of these groups advocated tactics of foot-dragging, non-compliance and outright defiance of the registration requirements.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Conservative Party of Canada under Stephen Harper seized on this as a good wedge issue in rural regions that might otherwise vote NDP, such as Northern Ontario, and suburban redoubts tempted to vote Liberal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Conservatives were abetted in this by the scandalous cost of the registry, about which the Liberals were rightly excoriated. However, that cost arguably made the waste worse when the Harper Government not only shut down the registry soon after it won a majority in the 2011 federal election but ordered, to the horror of most police forces including the one then led by Mr. Blair, that its records be destroyed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Gun advocates celebrated what seemed to be a decisive victory for them.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" id=""attachment_29178"" style=""width: 310px;""><img width=""300"" height=""255"" class=""size-medium wp-image-29178"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-29178"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cooper-1-300x255.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cooper-1-300x255.jpg 300w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cooper-1-1024x871.jpg 1024w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Cooper-1.jpg 1269w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-29178"">St. Albert-Edmonton MP Michael Cooper (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Since then, advocates of unrestricted gun ownership continue to use the same tactics – for example, telling long-gun owners <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-long-gun-registry-deadline-protest-1.4963232"">to delay registering their weapons with Quebec’s new provincial long-gun registry</a>. And so do the Conservatives – just days ago I received a flyer from my St. Albert-Edmonton MP, Conservative Michael Cooper, complaining tautologically that “when it comes to gun crime, law-abiding firearms owners are not the problem.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">What the Conservatives and the gun advocates may not have yet noticed since their legislative victory in 2012, though, is that <i>the times</i> <i>they are a’changin’, </i>at least as far as gun-safety laws go. Since then – for whatever reasons, and naturally there is plenty of disagreement about that – gun violence <i>particularly involving handguns</i> has come to be perceived by the public as a serious problem in Canada’s big cities. There is an appetite for action.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And this is where the sad story of the long-gun registry – and particularly the vandalistic destruction by Mr. Harper’s government of the data collected in it, regardless of the cost of the database – becomes relevant to the question of how to solve the problem of violence perpetrated with handguns in Canada.</p>
<p class=""p1"">An argument could certainly be made that the problems associated with handgun ownership in big cities could be eased or even solved through more stringent regulation, better registries, regulated storage sites, and so on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But we know from practical experience with the long-gun registry that some gun advocates will go to any length to undermine such laws, and they will be aided and abetted by the Conservative Party of Canada, which if elected again would undo whatever has been achieved in order to satisfy its Americanized, red-meat base.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This opens the door, thinking practically, to more radical solutions: to wit, an outright ban on handguns that will sweep up large numbers of such weapons, with penalties severe enough to make even defiant gun owners think twice about hiding them around their residences.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even if a future Conservative government were to undo such a ban, short of a national program to give away pistols it would be hard for them to restore the numbers of handguns to the country that had been taken off the streets by such a powerful measure.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So the success of the wannabe NRAs of Canada and their allies in the Conservative Party could be their undoing if the Trudeau Government has the courage to follow through on a handgun ban – about which, as noted here earlier, I am pessimistic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Gun advocates and Conservatives will argue that a ban is not the best of all possible solutions, and in an ideal world, that might be true.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But since their base position is wide-open ownership – which inevitably means more guns in the hands of criminals as well as LAGOs, and more LAGOs who instantly turn into criminals with the pull of a trigger – the best of all possible solutions, whatever it might be, is simply not possible.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The best solution to gun violence that is <i>actually</i> possible in Canada in 2019 is an outright ban on handguns. The longer it lasts, even if it is eventually undone, the more good it will do.</p>

289,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Liberal MP Jennifer O’Connell keeps the pot boiling under Jason Kenney and his questionable housing expense claims,2019-01-25 01:55:00,David Climenhaga,,"Just when you thought it was about to fade away over the coming weekend, the saga of Jason Kenney’s dubious House of Commons housing expense claims got a new lease on life yesterday thanks to a Liberal Member of Parliament from Ontario.

Jennifer O’Connell, MP for Pickering-Uxbridge, breathed new life into the story with a formal request for an investigation into “the possible misuse of the Travel Status Expense Account by Mr. Jason Kenney, the former Conservative Member of Parliament for Calgary Midnapore and Calgary Southeast.”


United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney wearing an expression we may be seeing a lot on his face (Photo: CBC).

And if you were thinking this was just some cranky Central Canadian MP tilting at a western windmill, you should probably think again.

Ms.O’Connell is not just any MP. She is Parliamentary Secretary to Finance Minister Bill Morneau with responsibility for Youth Economic Opportunities. In other words, she’s closer to the inner circle than most MPs, and she’s been spotted as someone with political talent who has at least the potential for a cabinet post someday.

What’s more, her office ensured copies of her short letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons asking for the investigation by the Board of Internal Economy, the committee that oversees expenditures by MPs, found its way into the hands of the members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery.

I doubt this would have happened without a nod from the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council Building across the street.

This is more, in my estimation, than a warning. It may not quite be open war, but it’s certainly a message to Alberta’s United Conservative Party that the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is going to play hardball with them, even if the Alberta NDP won’t.

It’s notice that that the Trudeau Government has had enough of Mr. Kenney’s relentless false claims that it is doing nothing to help Alberta build a pipeline to the West Coast and his frequent dark hints Mr. Trudeau is even trying to sabotage it, when they are spending literally billions of dollars and loads of political capital to achieve the opposite result.

Despite the fact he’s now a provincial Opposition leader running for Alberta’s top political job, Mr. Kenney has also not made much effort to hide the fact he views Mr. Trudeau, not Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, as his principal political rival, and that he covets the PM’s job in Ottawa.

Then there’s that notorious and unintentionally hilarious Maclean’s Magazine cover in which Mr. Kenney identified himself with a group of Conservative premiers who are actively trying to use their provincial positions to manoeuvre the federal Conservatives into power – a strategy from the U.S. Republican playbook hitherto not that common in Canada.


United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney wearing an expression we may be seeing a lot on his face (Photo: CBC).

So Ms. O’Connell’s move yesterday was tactical – her letter to Speaker Geoff Regan will keep the pot boiling under Mr. Kenney at a time he and his local media echo chamber are trying desperately to divert attention away from this issue. That may or may not help the Alberta NDP led by Rachel Notley, but it’s unlikely to hurt them. However, that’s probably not the primary objective.

It’s also strategic – intended to ensure Mr. Kenney never realizes his dream of returning to Ottawa in triumph. Or, for that matter, that any other Conservative manages the same feat as long as Mr. Trudeau is around.

So the first thing Ms. O’Connell’s letter is intended to do, it is said here, is to deliver a sharp lesson to Mr. Kenney that he is not the only Canadian politician who knows how to play hardball.

The Alberta NDP may have decided to be nice guys, and therefore risk finishing last while keeping their honour intact. But take note, the Trudeau Liberals are made of sterner stuff and if Mr. Kenney slams them, he’s going to get slammed back. Starting now.

The second thing it is surely intended to do is to neutralize Mr. Kenney as a threat to Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals in the mid-term, after they’ve finished with the hapless Andrew Scheer, the foundering leader of the federal Conservative Party.

This may not work well for the Liberals in Alberta. They may even lose some or all of their four Alberta seats in the federal election expected next fall. But they will likely reap dividends elsewhere in Canada, where Mr. Kenney’s noisy rejection of the idea of social licence for pipelines and sotto voce encouragement of the most extreme elements in his own party will not get him as much traction.

“The second residence allowance exists so that Members of Parliament can both fulfill their Parliamentary responsibilities as legislators in the House of Commons and remain present in their constituencies to help and support the Canadians they represent,” Ms. O’Connell stated in her letter to Mr. Regan. “However, it is important that this allowance be used fairly and properly.

“The allegation that Mr. Kenney declared his primary residence to be the basement of his mother’s home at an assisted living facility in Calgary, Alberta, and that Mr. Kenney was very rarely travelling to Calgary from his home in Ottawa raises grave concerns about whether Mr. Kenney’s arrangement breached the rules,” the letter continued. (Emphasis added.)

“Furthermore in an interview aired on CTV Calgary on January 22, the tenant of a neighbouring unit said ‘He never lived there’,” she wrote. “This also raises further questions about Mr. Kenney’s use of per diems and other allowances under the Travel Status Expenses Account.”

“I urge the Board of Internal Economy, with support from the House of Commons administration, to investigate this matter, make appropriate recommendations, or seek appropriate penalties and reimbursements from Mr. Kenney, should the Board find that he contravened the rules,” she concluded.

Government and NDP MLAs on the BOIE certainly have the numbers to make this happen with ease. The Liberals hold four seats and the NDP has one. The Conservatives have two.

Mr. Kenney, naturally, stuck to his frequent talking point claim the federal Liberals and Alberta New Democrats are allies and that the allegations about his conduct are “sleazy, baseless accusations.” His supporters among Postmedia’s political columnists can be expected to join that barking chain today.

But whether he likes it or not, this story now has legs. Mr. Kenney may have some ’splainin’ to do after all, and, if he does, developments are unlikely to be timed to suit his campaign schedule.

Justin Trudeau knows if Jason Kenney is elected it is going to make his re-election on a pro carbon tax platform that much more difficult. To me after 3 years of Justin Trudeau it is very obvious he doesn’t give a damn about taxpayers money and to pretend now that he does is laughable. This is all politics. Regardless of your political ideology Jason Kenney was one of the hardest working MP’s in Ottawa and being a higher profile MP was always on the road. This just shows me that even Justin Trudeau is afraid of Jason Kenney.

Off topic question, can someone explain the logic of Jagmeet Singh’s position on Venezuala?

1. Kinder Morgan’s anchor loop pipeline: 160 kilometre expansion project through BC and Alberta Rocky Mountain’s increased the flow of the Trans Mountain pipeline by 15%.
2. TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline( not keystone XL): Huge project connecting Alberta to Texas, construction began in January 2012 and was completed in 2017.
3. Enbridge’s Alberta Clipper pipeline: A 1600 kilometre pipeline from Alberta to Wisconsin was constructed in 2010.
4. Enbridge’s Line 9 reversal from near Hamilton Ontario to Montreal.

Northern Gateway was approved under Stephen Harper but was overturned in court when Justin Trudeau was Prime Minister. Justin Trudeau finally killed it with Premier Notley’s approval on Nov. 30, 2016, the same day he approved the Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge’s line 3. Trans Mountain has yet to see a shovel in the ground.

Then there is Keystone XL which was approved by Stephen Harper, held up by President Obama, approved by President Trump with construction projected to begin this year.
The Trans Mountain expansion began the approval process under Stephen Harper but that process is yet to be completed under Justin Trudeau.

FB: You do understand that the Judicial system operates separately and independently of elected Politicians? That means pipeline companies have to obey the law. When they cannot meet that test, there is really nothing politicians can do – unless they want to go down the same fascist path the Apartheid government of South Africa followed. That government consistently re-wrote laws to nullify human rights based court judgements against their policy. How do you feel about having your personal and property rights taken away from you to support the latest pet project of some political party?

Farmer Brian, none of those pipelines you mention made it to tidewater thanks for the so called hard working Jason Kenney. Eastern Canada is still buying oil from the middle east. I had two Enbridge pipelines cross my property during that time none needed approval from the Federal Government.

Is there anything Jason Kenney accomplished for Alberta or Canada during his 10 year term with the Federal Government? Except for taking Paul Martin’s balanced budget back to deficit.

I’ll volunteer to explain the logic of the NDP’s position on Venezuela. It’s a sovereign country that has the right to govern itself, indeed make its own mistakes, without US interference. The US has a sordid history in Latin America, and the latest steps seem to continue that pattern. Canada has long taken the independent position of dealing with the de facto government in other countries (Cuba, China) instead of following the US ideological lead. Ottawa’s hasty declaration should be reconsidered. And yes, the people of Venezuela are suffering, but so are the people of Puerto Rico. Should we be pursuing regime change there?

It’s no wonder the fawning scribes at Postmedia, who carry water for the UCP, wished this Kenney dumpster fire would extinguish itself — it’s hard to win when you’re always losing political ground.

With charges of a “Kamikaze” leadership campaign, improper nomination meetings, an ugly UCP rebellion against a top-down leadership style, suspicious dark money donations, cozy relationships with car dealers to spike the UCP election war chest, intemperate rhetoric by candidate nominees and members, ballot box stuffing and this newly uncovered bit of political chicanery surround a housing allowance, it’s really nice to see Jason Kenney’s scandal-plagued Alberta political career is off to such a good start — scandal-wise.

It seems right to me that the Feds should take the lead on this, after all it was Federal money and the issue here is whether Mr. Kenney fictitiously claimed to live in his moms seniors complex in order to get a housing allowance while an MP. If there is a role for the provincial government here it is mostly to watch as Mr. Kenney gets hoisted on his own petard. I suppose there are also some provincial matters at issue here too, such as that troubling donation Mr. Kenney made in Ontario (maybe one day he forgot what province he was “supposed” to live in) and maintaining an Alberta drivers license despite only being in Alberta for 4 days in 2015.

In any event, I suspect the Federal Liberals will do Mr. Kenney no favours in the timing of dealing with this matter and even as much as Mr. Kenney’s local media friends want to quickly sweep the whole thing under the carpet, the non Alberta national media will probably be glad to jump in and give this matter coverage. It probably wouldn’t be first time the Globe and Mail or Star might lead coverage of the misdeeds of an Alberta conservative politician that the local post media seems to initially miss or ignore. Of course, Kenney will try to spin it as the Federal Liberals being out to get him and encourage his friends in the local post media to echo that. The more fervent supporters of him and the UCP will go with that too, but I suspect those that are less committed or more independent minded will be concerned by these troubling allegations.

One other related problem for Mr. Kenney is that he plays politics a bit rough and so has made some enemies both in other parties and among Conservatives. If this housing allowance issue does cause him to falter, he could find the ride on the way down to be unexpectedly swift and bumpy.

Are the American influenced newspapers under Post media control, which support Jason Kenney, still controlled by American hedge funds? Not to long ago some of these Americans from the US hedge funds were on the Board of Postmedia. As Jason Kenney is a red white and blue poster boy for American influence, it is not surprising that Postmedia is propping him up like a puppet in their newspapers, like the Calgary Herald or the Sun.

It has been reported that Kenney had an illegal basement suite in his mother’s retirement unit, which was potentially subsidized by Canadian tax payers in part. The illegal suite apparently was not allowed by the retirement facility. I guess Kenney does not care much about rules and fairness though when he sees and opportunity to benefit. It begs the question, was Jason Kenney basically subsidizing his mother’s pad at the expense of Canadians? Alberta MLA Derek Fildebrandt got busted for renting out his tax payer subsidized unit in an Air B&B scam. I don’t see much difference between Derek Fildebrandt and Jason Kenney. They both took advantage of the Alberta tax payers. I guess that is why they call it the Alberta Advantage.

If that retirement housing facility was smart, they would fine Jason Kenney for his illegal suite and use the proceeds to upgrade the facilities.

The facts don’t support the myth that New Democratic Party governments always try to break the bank with health care spending!

Just as NDP governments have a better fiscal record than all other Canadian political parties that have formed governments, a new study by the Edmonton-based Parkland Institute released yesterday shows that when compared to Liberal, Conservative and conservative-allied governments, provincial NDP governments since the 1990s have approached financing public health care with an emphasis on fiscal prudence.

“Perhaps due to the precarious financial situations many of them faced when elected – and to the chagrin of many of the party’s base supporters – NDP governments have largely been content to hold the line on health care, rather than introduce sweeping changes,” observed the study’s co-author, Parkland Director Trevor Harrison in a statement accompanying the release of Alberta in Context, Health Care Under NDP Governments.


Study co-author Ian Hussey (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Of course, stating the opposite of both realities is a hardy perennial of conservative political propaganda in Canada, especially in the run-up to elections in which the NDP are competitive. These claims have been repeated as fact so often that huge numbers of Canadians simply assume they are true, and frankly disbelieve anyone who says otherwise.

The Parkland examination of health spending in B.C., Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia found that spending on health care as a percentage of GDP did tend to increase under NDP governments. However, while NDP governments defended public spending on health care, they didn’t greatly expand it after the early 1990s.


Study co-author Larissa Stendie (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Moreover, the report found that the portion of spending on public health care remained the highest and steadiest in the western provinces regardless of whether the New Democrats, Liberals or conservatives were in power.

Sadly, the report indicates that after the rise of neoliberalism in the late 1970s, all five NDP governments adopted many neoliberal economic nostrums and fiscal policies. While the Parkland study deals with health policy, this is true in other areas as well.

As is well understood, neoliberal governments try to cut public spending on health care to produce service cuts, allowing them in turn to justify privatization as a “solution” to a problem of their own creation. As a matter of practical economics, neoliberalism has been a failure, not delivering on its promises of the same level of care for less money. As an ideology, though, it has arguably been a success despite its repeated failure to deliver.

“Having all but abandoned the notion of increasing state revenues through direct ownership or Crown corporations, and later agreeing to lower corporate and individual taxes, NDP governments often found themselves trying to square the fiscal circle of meeting public needs and demands with dwindling revenues, while also trying to hold true to social democratic principles,” concludes the Parkland report, which was co-authored by Dr. Rebecca Graff-McRae, Larissa Stendie, and Ian Hussey, Parkland’s research manager.

Dr. Harrison concluded: “Perhaps of particular interest in Alberta today, we found that second-term NDP governments have historically tended to focus and spend more on health care than they did in the first term, and health care spending by incoming governments after the end of an NDP mandate tended to decrease or stagnate.”

As for the better fiscal record of NDP governments compared with other political parties, that is hardly news.

The Conservatives talk much about balancing budgets but are no better at it than Liberal governments when in power. Case in point- Alberta’s big deficit prior to 2015. They cut provincial taxes only in order to be able to cut services such as health care and education.

Their policy is to starve the beast in order to have an excuse to cut these expenditures.

Their will be no economic miracle following an election of Jason Kenney’s UCP. That will require a much higher price for oil and with the current glut of oil on world markets that isn’t going to happen. Just as cutting corporate taxes doesn’t produce business investment. Kenney will not change anything positively with his neoliberal/neoconservative austerity policies which are what resulted in the NDP being elected in 2015 when jim Prentice announced his plans.

People are free to believe what they want but should not expect miracles from any political party.

The impression conservatives have (or try to convey) of the Alberta NDP being big spenders is not correct, although of course it fits both their political narrative and preconceptions, so it will be very difficult to convince them otherwise. Hopefully, the government will have a better chance of convincing the less ideologically rigid portion of Alberta voters of this.

I think the biggest problem in trying to convey this responsible spending message is the large deficit itself, which of course arises not because of spending increases, but revenue reductions. Unfortunately, Alberta and its economy is still on the oil and gas roller coaster and while prices have recovered in the last year, they are still less than half of the peak in 2014 and accordingly royalty revenues have declined by tens of billions, which not coincidentally is close to the level of the deficit.

The NDP has done a good job containing spending, while not cutting services noticeably, which is ironically one reason why health care and education are no longer such big issues right now when pollsters ask about it. Perhaps it has also been long enough ago that some Albertans have forgotten about (or for newer Albertans and voters, never experienced) the particularly ugly years in the 1990’s when there were cuts to spending in health and education and all the disarray and problems that resulted. Maybe some of the news coverage from that time should be replayed now, so voters now will be aware of what they might get if they vote for a party that wants to cut spending. I still recall from that time around 3 to 5 prominent news stories every week for quite a while about many patient problems caused by the cuts and I think many, many more similar stories that were never covered.

As they say, those that don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it, so I think unless we really have forgotten the past, we don’t want to go down that path again.

What did Mr Sanger say about the NDP government giving Irving Shipyards in Halifax $296 million a decade ago? Said outfit held by reclusive billionaires had recently won a $23 billion contract from Stevie to build destroyers. Why the hell did Nova Scotia need to give ’em money for nothing? $300 from every Nova Scotian handed over to oligarchs. Never been properly explained. Stuff like that meant we got a Liberal government next, hell bent on austerity, amalgamating everything in sight, and assuming the facade of secrecy when asked for FOI requests. The only saving grace is that they are semi-socially progressive. Snarling Cons with no brains but slogan chanting don’t go down so well around these parts. The other problem faced by the NDP was the general belief that they would go easy on public sector unions.

When you have a situation that there is no other choice but monolithic public sector unions claiming pay increases and benefits beyond what private sector workers could ever hope to negotiate, and willing to strike because there is no “competition” for their services, the tax-paying public’s private parts are held to ransom. If a private sector union strikes, the consumer can pick another brand while the turmoil lasts. When the teachers go out, who you gonna call? Or the hospital support staff union? I’ve never liked public sector unions personally for that reason – I acknowledge that some sort of collaboration to prevent being used like peons is necessary for public sector employees, but it all seems so one-sided in their favour the way it is now. and they still get indexed pensions when most people are stranded having to work something out for themselves these days. There is a 2 to 1 difference in paid holidays, 12 versus 6, better vacations and so on. Haven’t a clue how to resolve it, but the NDP have to come up with something. All I see them do is vying for power like the rest of the pols. The grass roots are evaporating.

Are the NDP profligate in general? No, but only because they overcompensate so that the opposition can’t hold the spectre of excessive spending over them. Too worried about their PR for history’s sake, I think.

The silence on the proof of “the better fiscal record of NDP governments compared with other political parties via Canadians of Tax Fairness,” is interesting.
Re: the drastic cutbacks to health care in Alberta in the Klein era brings back memories for me. who was on the health care professional front line then. I still am. Then, we experienced many Alberta folks who had voted for the AB Conservatives and who entered the health care system, and came to the realization that their expectations were not being met. Some of them took it out on us on the front line, and finally some of us, knuckled under and said in response, “talk to Ralph Klein.” Many of us thought it and knew it, but did not say it. But, we did carry health care then with brutal hard work. Given the chance, at age 17, to decide what to do in life, and because of the Klein cutbacks, I would not do the nursing profession again.
What also happened then were the cutbacks to the med schools at the Universities of Alberta and Calgary. I believe we are still suffering from too few doctors in Alberta to this day as a result, particularly in the rural areas, along with the loss of acute care beds in the rural areas. We also lost many topnotch Alberta health care professionals to the USA.
Many of us health care professionals now look at the Jason Kenney UCP potential cutbacks to health care with a jaundiced eye. I will vote for the Rachel Notley AB NDP. “Build and hire, or cut and fire”…….
And for the well known anticipated mantra of “those unionized nurses making too much money,” it brings back to mind our Conservative/UCP voting farmer/rancher acquaintance who got bucked off his horse and sustained a severe back injury. Before, he would come to the local drop-in centre for coffee and complain that nurses made too much money. He needed all aspects of care from his Registered Nurses, i.e.urinary, gastrointestinal, pain management, emotional support, nutrition, observation for paralytic ileus … on an on, and including young RNs, many who now come out of a 4 year degree program with some $50,000 in student loans. Needless, to say, on recovery, he came back to the coffee gathering and amid much mocking, admitted that his nurses were worth every penny.

Health care is one of the principal areas of public services where Conservatives, both old-school PCs and the new UCP, not to mention DoFo in Ontariariario, talk incessantly about “cutting the fat”, “eliminating waste”, “too many managers”, and “won’t touch front-line services”. Of course, they have gotten gun-shy about overtly reducing services, justifiably fearful of public backlash, but their claims about making cuts that don’t adversely impact the point of care are disingenuous.

As a direct-care RN with over 30 years experience under my belt, let me tell you this is a fake promise, and further cutting layers of administration is a mirage. You see, as direct care staff, we rely on all those managers and mid-level directors for all sorts of things we can’t do ourselves. Hiring, mentoring and scheduling our co-workers, to both replace staff attrition—because people move, have babies, get sick, retire, die, win the lotto & move to Fiji—and to expand staffing levels when necessary, are management functions without which we are inevitably left short-handed. Ensuring we have the necessary support services, from equipment and supplies, to maintenance, to utilities to run care facilities, is a necessary management function. Paying us, since after all highly-qualified health care professionals are not volunteers: gotta have management to do that.

Setting evidence-based Policy, to ensure care processes are based on the best available evidence, is another key management function. So is financial oversight: any organization the size of AHS needs strong financial controls to prevent either inadvertent or intentional misspending. Same applies to quality assurance, infection prevention & control, and patient safety programmes. None of these directly touch the average patient, and yet you don’t want to run a health care system without them.

So, you can’t just go through the gigantic AHS org chart—which was, let’s not forget, the brainchild of Mr Ron Liepert—with a scythe, and expect to keep a quality health care system. You have to do it with a scalpel, and so at the end of the day, the savings will be negligible.

It won’t be pretty.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The federal government’s headlong rush to facilitate regime change in Venezuela is the sort of thing that would normally have Conservative politicians like Alberta Opposition Leader Jason Kenney darkly hinting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is secretly trying to wreck Alberta’s oil industry.

Yet there’s not a peep of that in this case, as the Conservative opposition parties in both Ottawa and Edmonton seem to be completely on board with U.S. President Donald Trump’s Venezuelan wag-the-dog scheme.

Ditto the NDP. Alberta’s New Democratic government seems to have said nothing pro or con. Federal Leader Jagmeet Singh’s messaging is so muddled it’s hard to know what the party’s policy is, or if it will be the same an hour from now.


Self-appointed Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido (Photo: Carlos García Soto; Wikimedia Commons).

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who acts as the Liberal Government’s spokesperson on this file, sounds persuasive, even if what she says often makes considerably less sense on close examination.

Regardless, there’s not a word of acknowledgement from Ms. Freeland or anyone else that a takeover by a politician who has promised to hand his country’s huge oil reserves over to the U.S. petroleum industry might have big implications for Alberta, let alone what to do about them.


Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (Photo: Wilsom Dias/Agência Brasil; Wikimedia Commons).

Ms. Freeland tells Canadian protesters who objected to Ottawa undermining the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that they enjoy democracy and, “I am sad to say, political protesters in Venezuela do not.” Meanwhile, her government takes the fact tens of thousands are demonstrating against the Maduro government in Venezuela as an argument for regime change.

In an interview earlier this week with the CBC’s Anna Maria Tremonti, Ms. Freeland insisted Canada must help the suffering people of Venezuela, but supported U.S. actions that have denied them food and medicine. U.S. sanctions may not be the principal reason for Venezuela’s economic crisis, but they are at least part of the cause of the country’s refugee crisis.


Toronto Star Journalist Thomas Walkom (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Ms. Freeland defended Canada as “a rule of law country” in the context of our current disputes with China over the arrest of a Chinese national arrested in Canada at the behest of the United States, but articulately supported the overthrow of the elected president of a foreign country on the grounds his domestic opponents say his election was rigged. She then observed, accurately enough, “If we let it become a law of the jungle kind of world, that is not a good world for Canada.”

She told Ms. Tremonti: “We need to be working really, really hard to maintain that rules-based international order and to build coalitions of like-minded countries who are going to work to maintain that order.” Seconds later she said: “That’s something that we’re doing in the Lima group” – which is pledged to force out Venezuela’s government.

Every word was delivered in tones both confident and reassuring.


Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Perhaps the explanation for this seeming cognitive dissonance, as Toronto Star columnist Thomas Walkom recently suggested, is that Ottawa doesn’t really give a hang about Mr. Maduro’s government but is looking for a way to suck up to Mr. Trump’s.

Regardless, the potential for unintended consequences in Alberta’s oilpatch seems to have been ignored completely, if it has even occurred to anyone as a possibility.

The problem for Alberta arises from our man Guaido’s promise to end the Maduro Government’s policy of requiring the national oil company Petroleos de Venezuela to hold a controlling stake in any joint venture with a foreign oil company. That would open the door to heavy U.S. corporate involvement in the vast Venezuelan oil reserves, said to be the largest in the world, and which include oilsands similar in size to Alberta’s. That, in turn, would end the United States’ blockade of Venezuelan oil, part of its campaign to topple the Maduro Government.

This is potentially serious for Alberta because Venezuela is conveniently located just across the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico from the U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, where most of Alberta’s low-quality bitumen nowadays ends up.


CBC broadcaster Anna Maria Tremonti (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the simplest terms, one likely effect of this unfolding scenario would be to flood those American refineries with cheap, heavy oil from Venezuela.

After that, it’s just a matter of supply and demand. A big increase in supply, conveniently located for inexpensive ocean transfer, will depress the price fetched by Alberta oil, especially low-quality oilsands bitumen.

Given the size of Venezuela’s reserves, the low prices could last for a very long time – possibly until the planet’s transition from a fossil fuel economy is complete.

U.S.-owned fossil fuel companies that have resisted building refining capacity in Alberta because they don’t want to compete with underused capacity at their Gulf Coast operations will have no problem replacing their Canadian supplies with cheaper Venezuelan crude. They have no loyalty to any jurisdiction, or to any notion of “ethical oil,” only to the best price and the best return on investment.

Where will Alberta be then? You’d think that would be a matter of concern for both federal Canadian and Alberta politicians, yet no one who holds office or is likely to appears to have given it a moment’s thought.

No doubt about it, Venezuela is a catastrophic mess. But should Canadian governments be advancing a solution to its troubles that may well make things worse and will certainly hurt Alberta’s essential oil industry and the Canadians who work in it","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">Regardless, the potential for unintended consequences in Alberta’s oilpatch seems to have been ignored completely, if it has even occurred to anyone as a possibility.</p>

That would open the door to heavy U.S. corporate involvement in the vast Venezuelan oil reserves, said to be the largest in the world, and which include oilsands similar in size to Alberta’s. That, in turn, would end the&nbsp;United States’ blockade of Venezuelan oil, part of its campaign to topple the Maduro Government.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is potentially serious for Alberta because Venezuela is conveniently located just across the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico from the U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, where most of Alberta’s low-quality bitumen nowadays ends up.</p>

<p class=""p1"">U.S.-owned fossil fuel companies that have resisted building refining capacity in Alberta because they don’t want to compete with underused capacity at their Gulf Coast operations will have no problem replacing their Canadian supplies with cheaper Venezuelan crude.

Venezuela has been a slow motion train wreck up until now and we can debate whose fault that is. I believe two things. First, there is plenty of blame to go around, secondly and more importantly it will continue to unfold slowly.

Yes, I think there will be regime change and the US will have a big role in it. However, Trump for all his faults seems genuinely reluctant to get too involved in the foreign misadventures that the US has seemed so eager to jump into in the recent past. US politicians like Bush thought a little foreign war would provide a good distraction from domestic problems, that is until these misadventured bogged the US down and exacerbated these problems.

Therefore, I suspect a much more covert plan is being developed this time that will involve no US troops on the ground as opposed to the faster regime change in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. It will also take some time for Venezuela’s oil industry to get back up to speed. I don’t think this will happen before the upcoming Alberta election.

Once regime change, or the counter revolution as I think it will more likely be called, happens the US will rush in with Marshall plan style loans. Of course, these loans will be repaid with big interest by increasing oil production considerably. Essentially, this will be a refined version of what should have happened in Iraq or Libya, if the plans hadn’t been bungled so bad. Perhaps the US might be more succesful this time, they have had plenty of practice in recent years at how not to do it.

You have to read the discredited tinfoil hat alternative press to find out any other view, such as the fact that this is just a rehash of Chile in the 1970s, and it’s all about getting Venezuelan oil into American hands.

“Ms. Freeland tells Canadian protesters who objected to Ottawa undermining the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that they enjoy democracy and, ‘I am sad to say, political protesters in Venezuela do not.'”

Argument of convenience. Canada supports, tolerates, and trades with several non-democratic nations. Human rights abusers China and Saudi Arabia come to mind. Russia. Cuba.

In the waning years of the petro-state, with Big Oil desperate to protect its profits (“The Big Stall”), one may be forgiven for wondering whether Canadians “enjoy democracy”. Yes, we get a vote, but then what?
A litany of betrayals and broken campaign promises. With a smile.

Under our first-past-the-post system, only the votes for the winning candidate count. The rest are tossed out. Millions of votes wasted. Millions of voices silenced. Not very democratic.

In Alberta, Big Oil and petro-politics is the only option on the ballot.
See Kevin Taft’s “Oil’s Deep State: How the petroleum industry undermines democracy and stops action on global warming – in Alberta, and in Ottawa”.

“…But with a government working in the interests of industry, citizens have been left out of the decision-making process, where the only way to register their voice is from behind the blockade line where they are marginalized, or worse, criminalized as radicals.”
• thenarwhal.ca/canada-s-petro-politics-playing-out-b-c-s-burnaby-mountain

Liberals and Conservatives, Republicans and Democrats. In their pro-corporate stance, these are just two wings of the same party.
On energy and climate, Notley and Kenney are on the same page. Now we have zero oil industry critics in the AB Legislature. And there won’t be any after 2019. Banished to opposition benches, a much-diminished NDP will be able to say nothing about oilsands expansion, oil & gas pollution, and climate inaction — because they leapt into bed with Big Oil.

“ …Under our first-past-the-post system, only the votes for the winning candidate count. The rest are tossed out. Millions of votes wasted. Millions of voices silenced. Not very democratic… “ No argument here. But unfortunately, Canadians seem to be irrevocably wedded to our relatively undemocratic Single-Member Plurality system, aka FPTP. Every time they are asked about changing to PropRep, they say “thanks, but no thanks”; the recently completed plebiscite in BC is the most recent example.

I think the issue is that the average Canadian voter values that one-to-one relationship between their electoral district, riding or constituency and their elected representative, whether it be a federal MP or provincial MLA, far more than they value any notion that the composition of the elected House reflect the popular vote. Canadians, for good or ill, continue to value the quaint 19th-century notion that their local MLA or MP is not just an elected representative in the legislature, but is also a sort of “super-Ombudsman” who can act on their behalf to break down bureaucratic barriers to get things done for constituents—what’s known amongst politicians as “constituency work”. Electing MPs or MLAs off of party lists, as would be necessary for true PR to be implemented, would more than likely mean a diminishment of that role, and Canadian voters simply don’t seem keen on that.

I think the only solution remaining would be one that would increase the cost of running elections quite significantly: change Single-Member Plurality to Single-Member Majority, requiring a candidate to get a true Majority of all votes cast to be elected in their electoral district, and conduct run-off elections in those EDs when no candidate wins a majority. It wouldn’t be truly proportional, but at least every MP or MLA serving would eventually be elected by a majority of voters. Of course, no Canadian jurisdiction is going to do that, because it would be more expensive than our current FPTP election machinery, and that simply would never fly.

With respect, Jerry, I think you’re wrong that “the average Canadian voter values that one-to-one relationship between their electoral district, riding or constituency and their elected representative.” In fact, I think most Canadians don’t give a hoot, and those who do mostly support some form of proportional representation. A significant – and growing minority – are openly hostile to democracy, or at least what we’d normally call “democratic norms.” In every case the campaigns against democratic reform have been (a) fear-based (“do you want to hand the balance of power to tiny religious parties, I mean, other than ours?), and (b) run by conservatives who benefit from the current system.

BC’s 2018 electoral-systems Referendum is a poor example of what Canadian (BC) voters want: we can’t tell if voters rejected prop-rep (by a decisive two-to-one margin) or the cocked-up process the governing party imposed onto what was should have been a completely nonpartisan, impartial referendum process. Personally, I don’t support pro-rep—for pretty good reasons, I think—but, nevertheless, BC Referendum was basically unfair to pro-rep supporters because the governing party salted in so many conflicts of interest (because it didin’t Delegate the process to the Chief Electoral Officer), confusing pro-rep options (one of them that party’s longtime endorsement, another that would have imposed two, separate systems, one for urban area, another for rural, and another a never-before-used conundrum), and mysteriously reserved decisions voters needed to know (in order to make an informed choice) for itself until after the Referendum —the irony, which might have been intentional, being that it appeared the government had given pro-rep so many unfair advantages over the status quo that it was too much for voters to take—and they spoke loud and clear.

You seem amenable to a ranked-ballot type of system (“Instant Runoff, for example) that would require each riding elects a parliamentarian by a majority (and thus each government would be assumed to represent an overall majority without offending our innurement to local representation). That option (or any majoritarian system) wasn’t on BC’s Referendum ballot. IRV requires only one voting opportunity, unlike, say, party leadership elections where separate voting happens in a series of ballots until a majority has been achieved; rather the IRV majority is achieved statistically by an automatic elimination method; it wouldn’t be any more expensive or lengthy than a FPtP election.

One of the worst aspects of BC’s 2018 Referendum (our third in a decade-and-a-half, each rejecting pro-rep) was, as usual, public funding of two “official” advocates, status quo or alternative, each propagating what they would—including patent falsehoods about their own preference and their rival’s. In the end, the “Yes” (pro-rep) side had told so many falsehoods as to thoroughly discredit themselves and any of the pro-rep options. Sure, that might be one measurement of how much pro-reppers wanted to change the system, but it probably put a wary electorate off—not of pro-rep, necessarily, but of the government’s horrible roll-out and voters’—especially pro-reppers—plain unpreparedness to adopt pro-rep: pro-reppers especially seemed not to understand the basics of out Westminster parliamentary system. Perhaps if they had admitted that the main criticism of pro-rep is a real issue ( that it opens the opportunity for small, potentially extremist parties, to win the balance of power with only a few seats) instead of making up preposterous rationalizations about how that would be either an impossible outcome or one which would be more democratic, both positions easily refuted by anyone who understands how and why elections are held—I dare say including even better-educated pro-reppers who were admittedly willing to take on that risk. FPtP supporters were called lying “scaremongers” or the dupes of shadowy, powerful interests merely for pointing out a fact.

It might have been that FPtP supporters were more strongly united (being slagged without warrant by pro-rep propagandists probably helped) than pro-reppers who, as it was in BC’s 2018 exercise, had three systems to defend and promote, some opting for one and necessarily rejecting the choice of their ostensible co-partisans.

The most misconceived element, IMHO, is that many voters naively think pro-rep would more precisely represent voters policy opinions when, in reality, a riding’s parliamentarian is essentially needed to vote for or against the cabinet’s budget, and nothing more. Pro-reppers (in BC) continually displayed their notion that the pro-rep elected parliament, which is almost always hung, sits down and hammers out policy all together consensually, each party contributing; that, naturally, isn’t how Westminster parliaments work: rather, the Governor recognizes the group (alliance or formal coalition of more than one party) which can pass “money bills” by a majority of parliamentary votes as the government; elected parties not in this group get as much say in forming policy as opposition parties do now under FPtP—that is, not very much. I think blatant misconceptions like that helped to sink pro-reppers’ boat. We weren’t asked to change the parliamentary system (which would require a difficult to achieve Constitutional Amendment, in any case) and pro-reppers either didn’t appear to know that, or their official advocacy group had propagated untruths about parliamentary procedure on their behalf.

When Maduro took over the reins of power in 2013 Venezuala was producing 2.7 million barrels per day. Today they are producing roughly 1.3 million barrels per day. In 2014 refinery utilization in Venezuala was over 60%, today it is at 22%. The government owns and runs all the oil producing infrastructure in Venezuala and has run it into the ground. Somewhere I read inflation is something like 1 million percent per year. It certainly appears that people are suffering. They are hungry and lack access to proper medical care. If Guaido comes to power my greatest hope is that he would allow humanitarian aid into Venezuala which Maduro will not. If he lets foreign companies improve Venezuala’s oil production ability and this improves the people’s quality of life I am all for it. As for your concern for Alberta, you have just made another compelling arguement for oil export pipelines to tidewater. Enjoy your day.

…and another compelling reason to reject the risk of a dilbit spill in the Salish Sea because even lower prices for a sunset industry’s only product, high-GHG-processed Dilbit, makes that risk even less worth it than it is now.

True, how much profit Big Bitumen does or doesn’t make shouldn’t matter to West Coasters because BC’s not constitutionally cut-in for a piece of the resource revenue; but it’s still a matter of principles (the rule-of-law with respect Aboriginal Rights and Title on ‘unceded’ territory—which is almost all of BC, west of the Rockies—and the environmentally imprudent increase of petroleum combustion into the atmosphere, for examples) which make the growing political opposition to TMX (the pipeline proposal to supply and ship supertankers of dilbit through the busy inside waters of BC and Washington state) all the stronger.

My concern is certainly an argument for oil export pipelines to tidewater, although I’m not sure it’s a very compelling one. It would be, I suppose, if the Law of Supply and Demand had been suspended (as far as I have heard, it has not), if Asia had sufficient interest in buying diluted bitumen (it has some, but not at a price high enough to make Alberta’s bitumen mining industry sustainable), or if there was a long-term future for growth in the fossil fuel industry (one way or another, this seems unlikely). Not to be overly pessimistic, but my prognosis for the future is that while fossil fuel companies will stall change that impedes their profits for a time, behind the scenes they will be transferring their assets into other businesses and leaving taxpayers in many countries holding the bag for their liabilities. In Alberta, that means, we are probably hooped – and we are certainly hooped if we elect a UCP government led by Jason Kenney, as seems likely. The only upside to this scenario I can see is that at least all the “Alberta separatists” will go home to Newfoundland and the Maritimes when the oil industry pulls up stakes and bugs out of here.

I certainly agree with you that Alberta is hooped. My reason for believing this is a little different than yours. Neither of the 2 most popular parties has a realistic plan on funding government. My understanding of NDP ideology is that to increase revenue higher taxes should be applied to corporations and to higher income earners but to continue to spend beyond our means until the economy grows enough that revenues catch up to expenses. Increasing these taxes has not increased revenues and our provincial debt has increased at an alarming rate. The UCP on the other hand believes decreasing taxes on corporations and high income earners will attract investment increasing employment therefore increasing revenue. They also believe government spending can be cut to reduce debt accumulation. While this looks good to voters I personally think the realistic amount that can be cut is fairly small. The only solution as I have said before is a sales tax. Demographics contribute to this necessity. As the population ages a higher percentage enter retirement reducing incomes and therefore income tax revenue but they still buy goods and services that a sales tax can be applied to creating a more consistent revenue source for government. Unfortunately Alberta voters are totally against a sales tax and by the time one is implemented we will be in one helluva mess.

As for the demise of fossil fuels, at present all you have to do is look at the AESO supply and demand report which gives up to the minute electrical demand and where it is being generated in Alberta to see how dependent we are on fossil fuels for electricity. During this latest cold snap I have looked at this various times. Electricity demand has been fairly constant around 11300-11400 megawatts(mw). We have 1445 MW of generating potential from wind turbines. Over the last few days their output has ranged from a low of 9 mw to a high of 200 mw. So their efficiency has ranged from below 1% to a high of 14%. I am not surprised, when we are in a cold stable air mass there is very little wind. As for solar the only one listed is in Brooks, which can produce a maximum of 15 mw. This afternoon at roughly 1:30 it was producing 2 mw or 13% efficiency. So where was most of our power coming from? Coal and natural gas. They have provided between 93 to 94% of our electric power over the last few days. Some hydro and biomass and some imported power from Montana provides the rest. The demise of fossil fuels as far as electricity goes in Alberta is certainly a day or two away. Enjoy your day.

Brian: I agree with most of what you have said here, as it happens. Certainly there will long be a market for fossil fuels, if only to fly airplanes, as you have pointed out in the past. The problem is prices, if demand falls as it is bound to, and sustainability, if prices are too low to sustain expensive marginal operations like oilsands mining. I also agree that the refusal to address revenue needs as a major failing of both the NDP and the UCP. I always enjoy my days, thank you. DJC

I heard the oil companies are not that keen about these regeime change shenanigans. The oil companies make their money processing and refining. The business of extracting crude out of the ground and sticking it barrels is something they would rather have somebody else worry about even if its nationalized. A local gov’t will have more than enough incentive to get their oil to port and onto tankers as efficently as possible as it represents a revenue stream.

Violently overthrowing the Maduro gov’t will make Venezuela highly unstable. The place has lots of jungle which is ideal for guerrilla warfare and most of Venezula’s oil is located in remote jungle areas. A regeime change will make the supply of oil to US refineries less stable.

This is an excellent article. Only if it could have been the length of a book.

Before Hugo Chavez became the democratically elected leader of Venezuela in 1999, the country was under right wing control and getting “raped.” Education and health care were poor. A lot of people were hungry and not doing well. Hugo Chavez came into power and spread the country’s wealth to the poor so people could become educated and get health care. Lives improved greatly.

The moment Hugo Chavez came into power, the Americans and their corrupt allies started playing hard ball with the Venezuela. Sanctions and assassination attempts are what the Americans do when they don’t like a country’s choice in leadership. The Americans have done everything they could other than outright war to destroy Venezuela. The sanctions are basically weapons of mass Venezuelan destruction and basically should be considered criminal.

From: former UN special rapporteur to Venezuela, Alfred de Zeyas
— “when such sanctions cause death through malnutrition, lack of access to medicines like insulin, anti-retroviral drugs, anti-malaria drugs, dyalysis etc. — and in the case of Venezuela many hundreds if not thousands of Venezuelans have died because of scarcities and distribution delays caused by the sanctions — this is deliberate homicide, this is murder, this is a crime against humanity, and could be examined under article 7 of the Statute of the ICC. Many governments should send complaints to the ICC Prosecutor at the Hague.”

I find it a joke that Americans send humanitarian aid trucks to the boarder of Venezuela while having sanctions that are destroying the economy and killing people. This is the worst public relations joke I have ever seen and the corrupt media, like the CBC and Global (which is American backed) , is swallowing it up and not doing journalism to tell people the real story. Or perhaps the big corporate media, like CBC and Global, is doing journalism- fake journalism to brainwash the masses.

The gist of DJC’s observes characteristics of a six century-old epoch called ‘globalization’; the variables are the same three-legged milking-stool or three-sided fireworks pinwheel as they’ve been lo all this time: strategy, mercantile commerce and technology, each ‘side’ or ‘leg’ of the globalization triangle supporting the superstructure in profitable stasis—just the way the wealthy like it. Thus we see, with respect Venezuela, the United State’s global and hemispheric hegemony in strategic terms (re: ‘accidentally’ revealed “5000 US troops”) amid nervous recollections of America’s military interventions in foreign affairs past, and now also America’s currently narcissistic economic viewpoint, and its technology that dutifully supports the other two legs by eschewing innovation of alternative, non-petroleum energy sources while garrisoning oil resources. Or, in short, the triangle of irresistible main force, monopoly and gizmos high-tech enough to keep it all “America First.”

Canada of course casts into this six hundred year-old drama as a bit player—a dilbit player—the subplot being something entirely new to both the epoch of globalization and times immemorial before that: this is the first time humankind has run out of places to grow or gather its food, maintain ecological engines that provide breathable air and drinkable water, build its cities, roads, airports and harbours, and dump its toxic exhausts and garbage. We know this because the integrity of each tripod leg which has for centuries held us in good stead is now being challenged by this new world, often because its own success has become excessive, and it’s trigonometric strength has weaken by a simple maxim of mechanics: you can’t push on a rope—at least not profitably. The main characters are Mutual Assured Destruction (its success is excess), gaping inequality (the peasants are revolting, the lords only more so) and, naturally, ecologically toxic industrial pollution. It’s this last leg that’s giving the world so much grief—and Canada’s perfectly cast for a role in its dramatization.

Hitherto, from the beginning of human time, right through globalization, almost to the present, there was no war, busted market or despoiled verdancy that couldn’t be fixed by simply moving to the next pristine frontier. Now that we’ve run out of room the candle burns at both ends, we consuming more than any capacity to replenish supply, let alone meet increasing demand; the bottom of the barrel has come into view through the murk. A new element has appeared to challenge the globalization superstar: it’s the environment. Who knew? Shakespeare? Neil Simon?

So, while DJC focuses mostly on the economic ramifications for Alberta if Americans play to wrest Venezuelan resource from its sovereign owners, the environmental aspect of bitumen mining and smelting is only hinted at by way of noting that Alberta’s “heavy oil” —diluted bitumen—is of relatively low quality compared with Venezuela’s non-bitumenous, heavy (real) oil. Naturally that difference is of mercantile importance, but when it comes time for Canada to recite its lines, it laments that not only is dilbit of inferior quality to Venezuelan oil in price terms, its per-unit greenhouse-gas processing output is way, way bigger. It’s the environmental subplot that’s also important to us Canadians, in a way that it simply isn’t for the USA or Venezuela or any other naturally-liquid oil producer.

Enter stage left: globalization meets Mother Nature somewhere between Fort Mac and Burnaby. The denouement would have to be: if the marketability of dilbit gets worse than it already is because a flood of Venezuelan oil out-competes it, then the substantial environmental risks of increasing production, some proven, others feared, make the TMX pipeline, for example, look even less worth it. With the largest patch of bitumen in the world, a vocal, well-funded and growing environmental movement opposed to increasing dilbit production, beautiful natural vistas of mountains, lakes, rivers and seas, and whole cities threatened by wildfires and floods attributed to climate change, Canada’s a natural for this bit part. Like for any actor, this dilbit part is very important to us, the economics merely contextual.

Freeland is a wannabe warmonger

Her active effort to replace Venezuela’s Government began with her formation of the Lima Group, nearly two years ago.

Canada’s Ottawa Citizen headlined on 19 August 2017, “Choosing Danger”, and their reporter Peter Hum interviewed Canada’s Ambassador to Venezuela, Ben Rowswell, who was then retiring from the post. Rowswell said that Venezuelans who wanted an overthrow of their Government would continue to have the full support of Canada’s Government:
“‘I think that some of them were sort of anx­ious that it (the em­bassy’s support for hu­man rights and democ­racy in Venezuela) might not con­tinue after I left,’ Rowswell said. ‘I don’t think they have any­thing to worry about be­cause Minister (of For­eign Af­fairs Chrys­tia) Free­land has Venezuela way at the top of her pri­or­ity list.’”

It will take years for Venezuela’s oil industry to recover from decades of neglect and mismanagement and by then the market will have changed again. The oil market is complex and this analysis is lightweight and another in a long line of attempts to create negativity around the Canadian oilsands industry.

Well, good luck with that.


In this old file shot from his days as a Tory minister, Mr. Mandel appears to explain his legal strategy … “M’lord, I only missed by this much!” (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

He blames a retired party financial functionary for the filing fiasco that resulted in six Alberta Party candidates, including his own wonderful self, being banned from running for public office in Alberta for five years. (“My CFO was sick. He missed some dates.”)

For heaven’s sake, this is embarrassing!

Maybe the time really has come for Mr. Mandel to retire. For that matter, the same point could be made about the whole long, twisty-turny Alberta Party experiment – which started out as just another Alberta right-wing fringe party, joined a province-wide political discussion club run by disillusioned Alberta Liberals to become an aspiring political movement slightly to the left of centre, and eventually was wrested back to the right by a group of supposed Red Tories led by Mr. Mandel.

Now this! Me, I miss the days in 2011 when Sue Huff was interim leader of the party and could mount the stage with her guitar and sing Somewhere Over The Rainbow in a sweet soprano voice with a straight face and without anyone breaking into guffaws. Turns out that was the high point of Alberta Party history! Who knew?

So, while this might mean Mr. Mandel ends his long political career on a sour note – if, indeed, that is what happens – it may be an opportunity to put the little party that never quite grew out of its misery. The events of the past few hours certainly can’t be described as a bravura performance for the party in general, or Mr. Mandel in particular.

The excuses trotted out for the missed deadline by the former Edmonton mayor and Progressive Conservative cabinet minister at his news conference in Edmonton this afternoon really were starting to take on a pathetic quality.

As a commenter on this blog observed this morning: “The ‘dog ate my homework’ excuse isn’t likely to fly for Mandel – no matter how hard he and his lawyers bark. Elections Alberta is meticulous. They should be when it’s the only job they’ve got to do – looking after administrative matters surrounding by-elections, elections and referenda.”

Well, never say never. This is Alberta, after all, and Mr. Mandel is a well-heeled guy with friends in high places. Still, you’ve got to consider this 11th hour strategy a Hail Mary pass at best.

Wouldn’t you think, if you’d received a letter in July saying clearly some routine bureaucracy had to be completed by Sept. 12, you would have done so by then, even if you thought the date was wrong? Mr. Mandel’s paperwork was filed on Sept. 27, and he wants you to know it wasn’t his fault. As the Edmonton Journal’s reporter pointed out, that’s a four-month window to complete a simple job.

It has never been clear to me whether the Alberta Party was more likely to rob the New Democratic Party Government or the United Conservative Party of votes, or whether even with Mr. Mandel at the helm it could do so in sufficient volume to have any kind of impact on the outcome of the upcoming general election.

Either way, it appears as if there is a significant chance that entire matter is now moot","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

As the Sinatra song goes, “Regrets, I’ve had a few, but more, more than this I did it my way”. I suspect Mr. Mandel comes from an era that would remember this tune well. Oh well, I suppose part of politics these days is to expect the strange and unexpected. I thought part of the reason the Alberta Party picked an EXPERIENCED person like Mr. Mandel as leader was to avoid snafus like this that one might expect to more likely trip up a political neophyte. I suppose in fairness to Mr. Mandel, most of his political experience was not at the provincial level or dealing with Elections Alberta and what little previous provincial political experience he did have was mixed at best.

Part of me wonders if this is a clever, deliberate self immolation. Mr. Mandel may have realized at some point this Alberta Party thing and he is not catching on, so he wanted to find a quick way out and back into comfortable retirement before the election, rather than suffer another embarrassing provincial defeat. It never quite made sense to me for the Alberta Party to pick Mr. Mandel as leader and I don’t think age was the biggest issue. First of all, he was not an MLA so had a limited profile on the provincial stage. Second, it seems to me that Calgary where they are still probably saying “Stephen who?” was and really still is the most potentially fertile ground for the Alberta Party. They already have 3 MLA’s in Calgary and the party veering in a more conservative direction would seem most likely to appeal to fiscally conservative and socially liberal voters who are most numerous in Calgary and who are somewhat uncomfortable with Kenney’s pro life and and anti gay past record.

Perhaps the Alberta Party and/or Mr. Mandel figured all this out a while after Mr. Mandel was chosen as leader or alternatively Mr. Mandel is really much worse with paper work than we thought. If it is the later, the only option now for Mr. Mandel seems to be to throw himself on the mercy of the court and hope for the best. However, I am not sure how much discretion a judge would have here, the rules seem fairly clear and not unduly onerous.

If Mr. Mandel does not find a sympathetic judge, the Alberta Party may end up going back to its former leader Mr. Clark, to carry it into the next election. This would be a bit odd, but this wouldn’t be the first time a party made a last minute leadership change and probably will not be the last. It worked for the Ontario PC’s not too long ago, although of course they were doing much better in the polls than the Alberta Party. I suppose the only upside to all of this is people are actually talking about the Alberta Party and Mr. Mandel for the first time in a while. As Oscar Wilde said that the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about at all, so perhaps in some odd, roundabout ways this might end up being for the best for the Alberta Party.

When parties or candidates do not follow the election procedure rules, they are banned from running, whether it is in Alberta or Venezuela. The rules may suck for the (lazy) candidates, but you have to play by the rules set out in the political game. Those rules are not that complicated here in Alberta or Venezuela.

For the Alberta Party to use tax payer subsidized donations to fight Elections Alberta with high priced lawyers in court on this paper work issue is a political joke and it should not be allowed. Albertans should not have to subsidize political parties like this. People who are economically hurting or those who do not donate to political parties should not have to subsidize political parties in ways like this.

The people should ask who will also pay for the Provincial court time that the Alberta Party will waste because of such stupidity? Will this court time take away from other more important court issues like criminal crimes? How much time and money will be wasted by Elections Alberta in this case? Will some criminal have his or her charges stayed because of the misuse of Alberta Party court time? This is just one more reason, in a long list of reasons, as to why all political donations should be banned in Alberta.

The election process should be simplified to better the political system and reduce wasteful costs. The 2015 election cost about $19 million dollars, not including about $3.6 million in tax credits for political donations, more money for candidate investigation costs and court time. Many of these costs could be reduced and the money could better be used for more important things like creating a fair level political playing field to benefit Albertans or improving health care.

If elections were primarily internet website run, many costs could be eliminated and a fairer election process would likely occur. Political donations could be easily eliminated as well which would simplify paperwork for parties like the Alberta Party. Instead of political donations and the associated millions in tax credits given primarily to wealthy people, parties could instead be given money by Elections Alberta for an internet website to run campaigns from. That would amount to a few hundred dollars per year per party. Some money would have to be allocated for rural candidates to travel to election debates. Candidates in urban areas can provide their own transportation out of their own pocket or ride a bike.

An internet website election campaign system would eliminate the need for corporate media advertising, election signs, Elections Alberta monitoring of campaign expense paperwork and more.

Perhaps the Queens Printer could print off one flyer for every candidate and have Elections Alberta mail the flyers along with official election information to each resident so that when you open your mail box, you will have one package with flyers from each candidate in the package along with information on how and where to vote. This would provide convenience for the voters while creating a fair level political playing field and it would reduce combined candidate and Election Alberta costs along with monitoring. This would also eliminate the need for election donations and the associated tax credits for this form of political mail marketing.

A Legislative Committee should be established to study how to make the Alberta election process easier, cheaper and fairer so parties like the Alberta Party can actually spend more time meeting people rather than sweating about paperwork. This way we won’t have so much court time wasted by politicians.

Karma…I am a Physician and I had family issues that caused me to submit AHS billings of 3500 after the 6 month deadline.

The rule allows discretion. I was denied and I appealed to then Mandel who was the Minister Of Health. He would’t budge and made the final denial. So I was out 3500 for services rendered. Karma is bitch.

267,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"The realpolitik of real politics: attack ads work, and sometimes they’re necessary",2019-02-15 02:02:00,David Climenhaga,,"One of the enduring myths of our era is that Albertans (or Canadians, or whomever) don’t like negative political advertising, and therefore that political attack ads won’t work here.

Now that Alberta’s New Democratic Party has published a website attacking Opposition Leader Jason Kenney’s record as a federal Conservative MP, cabinet minster and lifelong social conservative activist, with digital advertising spots on the same theme, we are bound to hear that notion repeated a lot.


Mr. Mason as he departed the news conference (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Mr. Kenney has spent his entire public life trying to impose his personal beliefs on people,” Transportation Minister and former NDP leader Brian Mason told a news conference called by the party in an Edmonton hotel yesterday afternoon to introduce the website and campaign.

“He has bragged about his work to stop same-sex couples from visiting their dying loved ones in hospital, and he has described his efforts in Ottawa to restrict women’s reproductive rights his ‘most distinct privilege,’” said Mr. Mason.

Within minutes, plenty of people on social media – not all of them supporters of Mr. Kenney’s party – were grumping about the negativity inherent in what the NDP news release called the “detailed and fact-based account of Mr. Kenney’s long career as a politician who works against the interests of everyday people, choosing instead to serve anti-abortion activists, anti LGBTQ groups and other special interests.”

You can judge for yourself by visiting TheTruthAboutJasonKenney.ca. There are footnotes – well, hyperlinks, which are the footnotes of the Internet era – so the NDP can say they’ve backed up everything they say with verifiable facts.

As to the notion that political attack advertising won’t work in Canada because Canadians don’t like it, that is far less certain. The record of political negativity, as they say, is ambiguous, but the prevalence of negative advertising in places a lot like our Alberta is not.


United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

According to Oxford Research Encyclopedias, while only 10 per cent of the advertisements aired during the 1960 U.S. presidential campaign went negative, in 2012 only about 14 per cent did not! There’s a reason for that and the reason is they work.

In other words, the prevailing wisdom contains a kernel of truth – most folks don’t much like negative political advertisements – but you simply cannot conclude from that they aren’t effective. Their prevalence in U.S. politics, their growing influence in Canada, and their arrival in Alberta 11 years ago prove they do.

From Democrat Lyndon Johnson’s apocalyptic “Daisy” ad in 1964 attacking Republican Barry Goldwater, to Republican George H.W. Bush’s unsavoury “Willie Horton” spot in 1988 attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis, to Conservative Stephen Harper’s successful effort in 2009 to plant the thought the brainy Liberal Michael Ignatieff was “just visiting,” done right, they get results.

There’s another piece of conventional wisdom that attack ads that mock a politician’s appearance or circumstances will flop, but those that attack a politician’s record are more likely to succeed. Having watched U.S. President Donald Trump campaign, it’s hard to feel confident even that is still true. If that’s the case, though, the NDP’s Truth-About-Jason campaign is safely on the side of the political angels.

Of course, no matter how good an attack ad is, such campaigns are not a silver bullet that can wipe out a 20-per-cent lead in the polls. For that to happen, the leading politician has to meet his or her opponent halfway, as did the hapless B.C. NDP leader Adrian Dix in 2013 when he countered then-premier Christy Clark’s attack ads with sunshine and bumbling.


Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Despite Mr. Kenney’s dismissive response yesterday, I don’t think the Alberta NDP can count on the United Conservative Party to stick to the high road the way Mr. Dix did in the event the NDP campaign starts to get traction.

The UCP cleverly announced some campaign finance proposals yesterday to distract from Mr. Mason’s presser. Ideas like a ban on MLAs crossing the floor of the Legislature, bound to appeal to the UCP’s red-meat Wildrose Party base, are pretty blatantly unconstitutional, but we’ll deal with them in more detail another day.

In the mean time, the NDP’s duly footnoted truths about Mr. Kenney does provide an opportunity for Albertans to compare him less than favourably with Premier Rachel Notley, who personally polls more positively than Mr. Kenney does.

“Given that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour,” Mr. Mason said yesterday, “Albertans deserve to know these and other truths about Mr. Kenney before they choose their next premier.”

“Mr. Kenney cares about privatizing health care, chipping away at women’s rights, and giving the richest 1 per cent of Albertans a tax cut they don’t need,” he said. “Rachel Notley cares about defending our hospitals, diversifying the economy, and treating every Albertan with dignity and respect.”

Mr. Mason will retire from his long career in Alberta politics after the election expected to be called any day now. If there’s any backsplash from the negativity unveiled yesterday, I doubt if the old New Democrat warhorse will much care if any of it lands on him.

<p class=""p1"">From Democrat Lyndon Johnson’s apocalyptic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDypP1KfOU"">“Daisy”</a> ad in 1964 attacking Republican Barry Goldwater, to Republican George H.W. Bush’s unsavoury <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o"">“Willie Horton”</a> spot in 1988 attacking Democrat Michael <span class=""s1"">Dukakis, to</span> Conservative Stephen Harper’s successful effort in 2009 to plant the thought the brainy Liberal Michael Ignatieff was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edcpuNB_Zxo"">“just visiting,”</a> done right, they get results.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There’s another piece of conventional wisdom that attack ads that mock a politician’s appearance or circumstances will flop, but those that attack a politician’s record are more likely to succeed. Having watched U.S. President Donald Trump campaign, it’s hard to feel confident even that is still true. If that’s the case, though, the NDP’s Truth-About-Jason campaign is safely on the side of the political angels.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, no matter how good an attack ad is, such campaigns are not a silver bullet that can wipe out a 20-per-cent lead in the polls. For that to happen, the leading politician has to meet his or her opponent halfway, as did the hapless B.C. NDP leader Adrian Dix in 2013 when he countered then-premier Christy Clark’s attack ads with sunshine and bumbling.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Despite Mr. Kenney’s dismissive response yesterday, I don’t think the Alberta NDP can count on the United Conservative Party to stick to the high road the way Mr. Dix did in the event the NDP campaign starts to get traction.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The UCP cleverly announced some campaign finance proposals yesterday to distract from Mr. Mason’s presser.

<p class=""p1"">In the mean time, the NDP’s duly footnoted truths about Mr. Kenney does provide an opportunity for Albertans to compare him less than favourably with Premier Rachel Notley, <a href=""https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/keith-gerein-polling-suggests-jason-kenneys-popularity-is-not-keeping-pace-with-his-party"">who personally polls more positively than Mr. Kenney</a> does.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Given that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour,” Mr. Mason said yesterday, “Albertans deserve to know these and other truths about Mr. Kenney before they choose their next premier.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Mr. Kenney cares about privatizing health care, chipping away at women’s rights, and giving the richest 1 per cent of Albertans a tax cut they don’t need,” he said. “Rachel Notley cares about defending our hospitals, diversifying the economy, and treating every Albertan with dignity and respect.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Mason will retire from his long career in Alberta politics after the election expected to be called any day now. If there’s any backsplash from the negativity unveiled yesterday, I doubt if the old New Democrat warhorse will much care if any of it lands on him.</p>

As I watch the news the last few days in relation to the upcoming election this is was sticks in my mind. The UCP is proposing to loosen up public liquor consumption laws, making some modifications to how the minimum wage applies to liquor servers, bringing in possible recall legislation, making crossing the floor in the legislature less attractive and the list goes on. Then we have the NDP, well they have found a new way to go after Jason Kenney, no surprise here. To me it appears the NDP is acknowledging that what they have done over the last 31/2 years is not that popular and that the only chance they have is to continue to attack Jason Kenney. If I was Jason Kenney I would consider this a very positive developement. David, enjoy your day.

So Farmer Brian you speak about liquor laws. Jason Kenney refers to liquor laws in Europe however never mentions anything about allowing liquor in grocery stores. I was involved in the privatization model in Alberta and why the private model is like it is, not allowing liquor in grocery stores, you just need to check who donated the most money to the PC party at that time. And then you make the comment that the NDP have done things that are not popular, do you mean like over 30 badly needed schools that were constructed or the construction of the cancer hospital in Calgary, maybe Jason Kenney can repeal these. And the minimum wage roll back, Kenney wants, that would only benefit the Walmarts, McDonalds and big chain grocery stores in Alberta. Is this what you and JK mean that we need to get back to the Alberta Advantage? Your logic continues to run backwards.

If you want to be entertained, shocked and enlightened watch a US political ad on cable when they are having an election. In comparisson, we Canadians seem positively polite, nice and genteel. Now, I don’t think attack ads always work either, but they can, especially if there is enough truth in them or they appeal to what people want to believe. I don’t think we should be afraid to upset someone to get a clear message across. I think the voters actually want and deserve some candor and not tip toeing around.

Kenney must have been a bit desperate to change the channel today, he actually talked policy again. It sounds like right out of his now discarded grassroots guarantee. However, I wonder if his recall promise would really survive much past the election if he gained power? Politicians in the past have trotted out similar pledges, to be conveniently forgotten, watered down or rescinded later. How can we be any more sure Kenney would keep his word?

I also suppose Ignatieff is not the only one who could be viewed as “Just Visiting”. Four days in a year, supposedly in his mom’s basement, sounds a lot more like visiting to me than living here. I suspect the more people get to know the real Kenney in the next while they will like him even less. Many Albertans, including some inclined to support his party, already have a vague uneasy feeling about him and most average voters have not even started paying close attention to the upcoming election yet.

Maybe what is put forward about Kenney will seem a bit nasty because there is really not that much good to say.

I wonder if Jason Kenney ever reflects on the fact that the best way for him to succeed in his ‘mission’ to unite the conservatives and defeat the NDP would have been for him to not run for leader.

Ignatieff has himself to blame for losing to Harper—although negative ads probably didn’t (or did) help: he accepted his leadership appointment from the Liberal Party executive instead of from the membership after burning up the little political capital he brought with him from his 35-year tenure at an American University. The way I parsed the guts and feathers back then was this: a significant number of erstwhile Liberal voters didn’t like that appointment and a significant number of them simply stayed home to protest on the big day instead of casting for an alternative.

The whole thing went waaaay back to John Turner beating Jean Chrétien for the leadership when Free Trade and the GST were the hot issues. The fissure into which Chrétien crawled to fight his way to three Liberal majorities ( one of them now famous: le ‘tit gars de Shawinigan kept us out if Iraq); but the scrappy, wily, straight -through-the-heart Chrétien left scar tissue on either side of this peuodo-tzit-tzim, making it hard to weld back together when the Shawinigan Strangler retired from the vacuole, kinda like the Norse god-cat that holds the heavens and earth together, one flick of its tale signalling the end of the Liberal cosmos and leaving a nasty gash into which Paul Martin, then Bob Rae, then Stephane Dion then Michael Ignatieff tumbled, consumed all. Then Harper and Jack Layton (replaced by Thomas Mulcair upon Layton’s death) held the gaping maw apart long enough for both their zeniths to eventually get squashed in the crusher, too. We are reminded that when the Turner-Chrétien stress-fracture snapped shut on Mulroney’s back-to-back governments it squished the two largest federal majorities in Canadian history down to the size of a penny on a railroad track— while Jean kept his fingers and toes safely out of the way.

Stephen Harper’s negativity towards the Liberals was as strategic as it was personal or tactical: he believed (and Conservative Theologians scribbled) that he would remake Canada in his own image by slaying the hissing Liberal devil-dragon that’d been ‘Canada’s Natural Government’ since Laurier, not just by leader ad hominem, not just the party, but the whole middle-of-the-road ethos of Canadian politcal culture, leaving, he calculated, the field for the far right and the few left. In reality, Harper only took a selfie with one foot standing triumphantly on a “vanquished” Liberal party which, truth be known, he actually found unconscious on the ground, almost bled out from self-inflicted wounds it sustained in its own knife fight.

The Liberal schism fissured right across the country and three back-to-back federal minorities toppled in; half-a-dozen years of default Harper minorities followed until he dropped his prybar down the closing crevice after winning but a single majority (the HarperCons’ electoral cheating notwithstanding); Trudeau the Younger bathed at the sunny telos, his Liberal party battle-scarred but now purged, the closing chasm only visible where the NDP’s sixteen seats in Quebec hold it open like a pebble keeping a firedoor ajar; while JT was blowing Harper away, despite the long, long “He’s Just Not Ready” negative campaign paean, Harper and Mulcair wrapped themselves the niqab, the scoundrel and anti-scoundrel, respectively.

Really, in terms of Con-negativity it was always difficult to tell if Harper was being negative or just breathing.

Are the Liberals still Canada’s Natrual Governing Party after all that? It’s notable that of the three main parties the Liberals are the only unified one, almost a teleology as if they’ll always be there in the end (Harper’s nightmare scenario he proved unable to wrest). The far-right and the few-left have resumed their positions as footnotes to the larger text of federal politics and history, both parties with palpable schizophrenia, both in their hallucinatory phases—and maybe soon a straightjacket phase for the NDP if Jagmeet loses the Burnaby by-election week-after-next.

I, for one, am somewhat disappointed the NDP have gone this route. Yes, Premier Jason Kenney is a frightening prospect for anyone left of the Paleolithic Epoch. But, while attack ads do work, sometimes, they can also drive cynicism towards politics & politicians and drive down voter turnout. You can be sure that the Wilberforce Conservative Party will have a dedicated GOTV effort ready to go when the writ is dropped, and the NDP’s only hope is for currently uncommitted voters to go to the polls and vote for steady, competent, drama-free governance. This sort of thing risks making them declare a pox on both houses, which is to the WCP’s advantage.

What the NDP is acknowledging is that 45% of Albertans are fuckwits who have given overwhelming electoral majorities of 55-75% to conservative parties in all elections but one since 1905. This voting record cannot be explained by facts on the ground or by policy preferences, as you disingenuously imply. There is no ordinary way to reach these people, who are clearly beyond the reach of reason. A large portion (the 45% at least) of that that 55-75% will vote Kenney exactly because he is a misogynist, bible-pounding, bullying asshole, as are so very many Albertans (and North Americans, it must be said). But not all of them. Pointing out to those just who exactly they are voting for might pry a sufficient number of the habitual-but-not-ideological con voters away so as to have some positive electoral consequence. So yes, it’s the only road open to the NDP, but it’s not because of their policies per se. It’s because of the Alberta electorate, which would be more at home in Alabama than in a modern secular industrial democracy.

I’ll vote for Kenney because he might cut spending. The 20% claim on the NDP website would be about perfect as it would bring Alberta’s per capita spending down to BC levels.

The rest of the NDP website is drivel. Social policy is irrelevant because government long ago lost the ability to influence social norms. Government’s only role is service provider of last resort. The key performance indicator is how efficiently government can provide those services.

The Left have failed Canada for 4 years now, Provincially and Federally, we are weaker and in massive debt. The Left know how to TAKE our money, but are clueless on how to MAKE us money! The Left have shown that they are unbalanced, self-serving, unsustainable, failed agenda driven hypocrites. Alberta and Canada must not reward failure with any more years! My Provincial vote is for Jason Kenney and the UCP, my Federal vote is for Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives!

We want our Alberta and Canada back, after 4 LONG years of Leftist Failure! A strong Alberta is a Strong Canada!

Local news commentators here in Alberta interpreted this as a stall by the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. For once, it’s possible there’s something to this beyond their habitual anti-Trudeau spin.


Former principal secretary Gerald Butts (Photo: Wikimedia Commons).

But the national news was dominated by the SNC-Lavalin scandal (if a scandal it is), the fallout from the resignation of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould during the mismanagement of that same affair by the Prime Minister’s Office, and the decision by someone, somewhere that the prime minister’s principal secretary must fall on his sword to atone.

The biggest headlines of the weekend were devoted to “the bombshell departure,” as the CBC put it, of Gerald Butts, the PM’s friend and close advisor, who will now depart in partial payment for the embarrassing brouhaha.

My friends of the left and right, not to mention my old pals from the Calgary Herald picket line, will have to forgive me if I say I agree with the basic premise of Conrad Black’s rambling column in the National Post Friday. That is, that while the PMO has clearly bungled the SNC-Lavalin affair, the Quebec corporation’s business practices abroad don’t amount to all that much of a scandal, and if Ms. Wilson-Raybould felt she had been demoted for actions as yet unknown when she was shuffled to the associate defence portfolio, that would have been the time for her to quit.

Regardless, what we are now seeing, I strongly suspect, is the lizard brain of Canada’s National Governing Party reasserting itself and engaging its primal understanding of the real scandal of this crisis. To wit, that the PMO has fumbled things to the point they can be meaningfully exploited by the ex-Rebel-Media twerps who surround Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer!

So, if I am right, we are about to see the stuff that makes the Liberal Party of Canada the Natural Governing Party. This, it is said here, is where the pipeline “stall” comes in.

I reckon someone in the Liberal Party brain trust – and I don’t use that term sarcastically, for once – has done the arithmetic and concluded the Trudeau Government has gained very little from its co-operation with the Notley Government and its heavy investment of political and actual capital in the TMX Project.

Indeed, it must by now have concluded the party stands to lose significantly – and, in the present situation, potentially fatally – in other regions of the country if this is allowed to continue. Therefore, remedial measures must be taken.


Former newspaper magnate and National Post columnist Conrad Black (Photo: Calgary Herald Strike Archives).

To put this another way, Alberta Opposition Leader Jason Kenney has it precisely backward when he says Premier Rachel Notley’s efforts to achieve social licence have been a spectacular failure in getting Alberta the pipeline it demands. In reality, as has been argued here before, it is Ms. Notley’s social licence effort that has gotten the project closer to completion than anything ever done by Conservatives in Ottawa or Edmonton.

Alas, Mr. Kenney may be right insofar as Ms. Notley’s manifest success has apparently not gotten her as far as she needs to get with her own voters here in Alberta. Indeed, the more she fights for the pipeline, the stronger Mr. Kenney seems to get because the file is seen, however wrongfully, by too many voters as a United Conservative Party strength.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

That said, Mr. Kenney is certainly delighted with this delay, since it means there will likely be no pre-election announcement that all is well on the pipeline-expansion front and he can continue with his claims of NDP-Liberal failure unchallenged except by bloggers with insignificant readerships.

Meanwhile, although the Trudeau Government’s efforts moved the needle on the popularity of the expansion project elsewhere, going along with Alberta’s pipeline crusade has done nothing whatsoever in Alberta for the prime minister.

So, it is said here, realpolitik has finally reasserted itself in the NGP brain and the likely result is that the pipeline expansion will indeed be stalled until after the Alberta election, after which it will be reassessed.

If Premier Notley somehow manages to pull the fat out of the fire and her government is reelected, it will probably be back on track.


The Watergate Complex in Washington D.C. (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If Mr. Trudeau’s rival and sworn enemy Mr. Kenney wins, as current polling suggests is likely, the best Alberta pipeline advocates can hope for is that the project will eventually proceed well after the fall federal election.

In the event the Liberals win the fall federal election with the help of voters in British Columbia whom Mr. Trudeau not long ago seemed willing to alienate and even lose, maybe TMX Project won’t be restarted for a very long time. At least, that is, until Mr. Kenney has been eliminated as a threat, and possibly even as an annoyance.

If after that, as also seems likely, Democrats recapture the White House, the policies of our large neighbour to the south seem likely to return to cautious efforts to slow global climate change – more bad news for Alberta’s bitumen miners that makes additional pipelines even less likely.

Given that all Alberta oil booms nowadays are principally construction booms, over the longer term, angry war room rhetoric and protest convoys will make little difference and Alberta will have pissed away a final oil boom before it even started.

Meanwhile, as for SNC-Lavalin, Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and all that, as was said of the third-rate burglary attempt at the Watergate Hotel that brought down U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1974, the cover-up is usually worse than the crime.

<p class=""p1"">If after that, as also seems likely, Democrats recapture the White House, the policies of our large neighbour to the south seem likely to return to cautious efforts to slow global climate change – more bad news for Alberta’s bitumen miners that makes additional pipelines even less likely.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Given that all Alberta oil booms nowadays are principally <i>construction</i> booms, over the longer term, angry war room rhetoric and protest convoys will make little difference and Alberta will have pissed away a final oil boom before it even started.</p>

David I believe you are missing one important point. I believe Justin Trudeau wants Jason Kenney to win the Alberta election. He wants to present himself as the progressive alternative to the ever growing group of conservative provincial governments. The apparent Liberal postponement of the TMX decision has eliminated Premier Notley’s faint hope for some positivity on this file before the provincial election. Personally I have always believed TMX would never be built while Justin Trudeau was the Prime Minister.

As far as the Gerald Butts resignation, this is in my opinion just the beginning. Ethics aren’t Justin Trudeau’s strong point!

Finally Farmer Brian I can agree with you (you found a way not to run backwards for a change in your comments), Trudeau needs Kenney to win the Alberta election so he can have a whipping boy that will help him win Quebec, Ontario and B. C. Trudeau does not care if the TMX ever gets built, it will never help him win any elections. All Trudeau wants is to pander to Quebec, Ontario and B.C. and that will give him enough to win. And the big money men are from those provinces who support the liberals.

I think I am also in the position of agreeing with the former Lord Black in this case. If the Federal Liberals seem to have cautiously only done Premier Notley a few favours from time to time, they will do something between as little as possible and nothing if they have to deal with Kenney, with it likely being closer to the latter.

There is so little love lost, I think they may not take his calls, if Kenney bothers to try pleading. As for meetings, I suspect the Federal Liberals will find insurmountable scheduling difficulties. If Kenney then has one or more of his hissy fits, the Federal Liberals will probably just ignore him. He may have managed to whip up anger in Alberta and may continue to do so, but the rest of the country, especially where the Liberals need to win does not care so much. They have other issues than pipelines.

I suspect a frustrated Kenney would end up channeling anger and threats at other parts of Canada, which might temporarily boost his popularity here, but alienate potential allies elsewhere. Eventually Albertans will start to see his approach is less productive than the current one. You see it is not all about us, it is more importantly about them and trying to be supportive to Alberta’s energy industry has got the Federal Liberals very little but grief so far, or as the more business minded would say it has been a poor return on their investment of political capital. If they have to deal with Kenney, that is when the Federal Liberals will decide to finally cut their losses and abandon their current approach.

If SNC-Lavalin’s business practices abroad are not that much of a scandal, why did the World Bank debar them from any of the bank’s development for a decade from 2013?

http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2013/4/18/ten-year-world-bank-debarment-for-snc-lavalin.html

Two things strike me: first, the World Bank is not exactly regarded as lily-white itself, having had many of its practices dunned and exposed by luminaries such as Michael Hudson (google those two together and stand back); second, the fecund warblings of Conrad Black, a non-Canadian who explicitly rejected his Canadian citizenship to frolic in Lord-like fashion at London garden parties as proprietor of the right wing Daily Telegraph but who was convicted by the USA and served criminal time for defrauding investors, should be treated with a grain of salt at all times. To give an idea of the internal economic elite corruption we face in Canada, this blowhard Black has been given refuge in Canada since his release from US prison, even though he’s not Canadian. What can we expect from such a criminally-convicted turncoat propped up by his billionaire pals to sit around in our country which he had previously publicly rejected, thence to lecture Canadians as to right and wrong? I know – only the truth. Sure. All merely coloured by the personal hurt he feels was inflicted on his amoral soul by nasty American prosecutors and judge who cut his pretentious oratorical skills off at the hip, got down to the nitty-gritty and found him guilty. This is not a man whose moral judgments can be regarded as reliable.

Your old Calgary Herald comrades may forgive you for agreeing with the blattings of a Conrad Black, but I don’t. This is risible horsesh*t.

The scarcely moral neoliberal World Bank run out of Washington DC as an adjunct of US monetary imperialism has decided even by its low standards and holding of noses that SNC-Lavalin is an untrustworthy outfit not fit to bid on its global contracts on the one hand. On the other, we have Conrad Black and you deciding SNC-Lavalin’s overseas kickback operations weren’t all that bad of a scandal. Who to trust on the matter? If it takes more than mere common sense to answer this, then the country is completely lost.

Time for a rethink, I believe. We need no more economic elite/giant corporation attempting to sway things their way in this country, aided and abetted by politicians of both the Liberal and Conservative stripes in order to keep “jobs”, because corporate employees might be “unfairly” affected by the lack of ethics at management level. Sure, let’s reward corrupt practices by ignoring them and giving away our taxpayer money and projects to these dolts, and then with a bit of luck, all these transgressions will soon be forgotten, leaving the same amoral leadership, both corporate and governmental, to continue to prey on the citizens of Canada.

As a professional engineer who took seriously the oath I swore to be an honest professional, I retch at the sight of people running a supposedly engineering company who regard ethics as merely another thing to trample to the ground in the quest for money, power and profit. Their behaviour has not been and is not defensible. Having worked for a very well-known French international company four decades ago, and privy to the highly confidential internal policy on how to deal with foreign attempts at interference, I will only say – by comparison to SNC-Lavalin, that management were eligible for sainthood – I felt no moral aversions whatsoever.

What then for Alberta’s ‘all that wealth in the ground’ ? ?
What then for a British Columbia that has cast the die for incoming pipelines, expanded ports, daily 1/2 full smaller supertankers bound primarily for Washington State, California and the Gulf Coast.. and an equal number of daily inbound supertankers, thrashing through the Salish Sea ?

The Conservatives, of course, are hoping to use this whole affair to convince people to vote for them instead of the Liberals. That is where the whole scandal issue becomes dead in the water.

Between Andrew Scheer’s promises to scrap the carbon tax and replace it with meaningless rhetoric, plus the fact that he is a former Stephen Harper disciple, I assume that a Scheer government would mean muzzled scientists and another wasted 4 years on the climate change front.

Even if we assume that Justin Trudeau did try to compromise the independence of the judiciary, I would still choose that over another Stephen Harper.

“Indeed, the more [Notley] fights for the pipeline, the stronger Mr. Kenney seems to get because the file is seen, however wrongfully, by too many voters as a United Conservative Party strength.

The pipeline runs even deeper than that. The more Notley fights for pipelines, the more she fans the flames of anger and resentment among Albertans. The more she underlines her own failure on the file. All Albertans got out of the deal so far was a detested carbon tax. All the blame for all our ills, real and imagined, falls upon Notley and Trudeau.
A pipeline project without which the industry and the province flourished for years suddenly becomes the rallying flag for Albertans, whose sense of grievance against Ottawa burns eternal. Fuelling the right-wing rage machine.
Notley’s pipeline hysteria is going to sweep the NDP away this spring. She played right into Kenney’s hands.

Here is one of your old Herald pals taking the bait and pushing back on your comments on the Black piece about the SNC Lavalin scandal. How could you treat with such insouciance the words of this man dismissing corruption as a minor matter? The same man who once called you and others gangrenous limbs that needed to be amputated. But I digress from my main point which is disgust at the SNC Lavalin bribery activities, and, at least as bad, the Deferred Prosecution Agreement legislation hidden in a massive omnibus bill (anti-democratic devices that we hated so much with the Harper regime) approved by the corporate Liberals. We’ve already read about the worst parts of this saga, and the result is ugly.
On your other point, it’s surprising the Trudeau Libs didn’t give up long ago on working with Alberta, given the irrational personal attacks the PM has been subjected to. I dislike intensely much of what he has done (or not done), but can only despise the relentless ad hominem attacks on him. Then there’s this pathetic convoy “rolling” into Ottawa. Spare us the embarrassment of this bizarre spectacle of monster trucks, trying to bolster its cause with anti-immigrant sentiment.

I suspect you’re on to something here David, finally.
This pipeline is a $10+ Billion project that will not be profitable unless it can operate somewhere close to capacity for the next 40 years. No one is going to build it on a whim.
As I have stated before, no one alive today will ever see another continental pipeline built in N.America.

The Liberals risk far more by allowing pipelines through BC, or through Quebec if Energy East is resurrected, than they stand to lose if none get built, ever. Take a look at Eric Grenier’s CBC Poll Tracker—https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poll-tracker-federal-poll-averages-and-seat-projections-1.4171977—and the seat projections broken down by region:
Atlantic: Lib 25, Con 7
Quebec: Lib 56, Con 14, BQ 8
Ontario: Lib 74, Con 43, NDP 4
“Prairies” (MB & SK): Lib 8, Con 20
Alberta: Lib 2, Con 32
BC: Lib 16, Con 16, NDP 9, Green 1

Politics is about getting re-elected, period. Forcing a pipeline through the Lower Mainland over the objections of the people through whose neighbourhoods it has to run is a non-starter if they hope to win a second majority. No truck convoys or JK tantrums will change that.

You’re right, Jerry. I have shirt-tail relatives on the B.C. Coast. They are fine people, if a little self-righteous about who is responsible for how well they have done in life. They are lifelong Conservatives who voted for Stephen Harper in Ottawa and Christy Clark in Victoria. They told me recently that Alberta’s pipeline would be built over their dead bodies. They will never vote for any damned party that supports greedy Alberta’s filthy pipeline. And these are the conservatives on the coast! As for the polls that show “majority” support in B.C. support the TMX expansion, unlike the Salish Sea, that support is a mile wide and an inch deep. No one out there has seriously tried to counter the Alberta-Oil Industry propaganda campaign, because they haven’t yet needed to. When the time comes, the needle will swing, and it won’t be in Alberta’s favour. Being tied in with a bunch of Nazis as Alberta’s loudest supporters won’t help the Axis of Oil much either.

Everyone’s so sure SNC Lavalin is going to be found guilty in court and barred from Canadian Federal Government contracts for 10 years? I have not been following this closely but what I’ve seen is SNC executives consistently “beating the rap” and scant evidence which would actually convict the company either.
I think Ms. Wilson-Raybould would have been a good person to supervise a strict remediation agreement to oversee SNC Lavalin, but that won’t happen now. She’s gone and SNC will probably walk.

Bear with me while we ponder this. There is a troubling point. It will take us only a moment to get there.


Louis Riel, 19th Century Canadian revolutionary (Photo: Public Domain).

Mr. Scheer, who leads the Canadian political party most directly descended from the one responsible for hanging the man who was president of the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan for three months in 1885, tweeted on February 18 that, “as a Canadian politician of Métis background, Louis Riel was the driving force behind the creation of Manitoba as a new Canadian province.”

This is even sort of true, in a soaringly idiotic kind of way. If you didn’t know better, you might assume it was the work of someone who hadn’t read a lot of history – which can’t be reassuring if you’re a student contemplating pursuing a degree through the History Department of the University of Ottawa, where Mr. Scheer studied for a spell.

At any rate, Mr. Scheer’s tweeted observation, while unique, is paradoxically not unusual.


Former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader Peter MacKay (Photo: Erin A. Kirk-Cuomo, Creative Commons).

Consider the televised commentary the very same day by Peter MacKay, briefly also leader of the same party, although while it was doing business under a slightly different name in the early Zeroes.

Speaking of the resignation that day of Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s principal secretary, Mr. MacKay similarly opined, “I don’t think there’s ever been this much power vested in a single non-elected person, certainly in my memory of political history. You have to go back, years and years, perhaps to the Tsar in Russia and Rasputin before you had somebody who wielded so much power, and we know that it didn’t end well there.”

This prompted a flurry of hilarious Tweets in response, many quoting the immortal Boney M hit – Rah, Rah, Rasputeen, lover of the Russian Queen, that was a cat who really was gone …” – which has a great beat and lines lame enough for a Conservative Party of Canada press release.

Neither Mr. Butts nor Henry Kissinger will likely bother to pick up the phone and complain directly to Mr. MacKay, but let’s just say he and Mr. Scheer demonstrate a similar grasp of political history.


Russian mystic and royal political advisor Grigori Rasputin (Photo: Public Domain).

Actually, as an aside, I suspect the Rasputin line was put in Mr. MacKay’s head a couple of years ago when Marci McDonald described how he was deftly outmanoeuvred by Stephen Harper in the hostile reverse takeover the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, comparing the former Conservative prime minister’s advisor Tom Flanagan to … yes, the Russian mystic and Tsar Nicholas’s BFF, Grigori Rasputin.

Be that as it may, as Mr. MacKay’s commentary illustrates, Mr. Sheer’s breathtaking Riel tweet is part of a pattern – which, at last, brings us to the point.

We are all familiar with the modern philosopher George Santayana’s observation that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.

But what about those who can’t remember the past correctly? One shudders to think what they might be doomed to repeat!

This is a serious matter. After all, Mr. Scheer seems to be someone who doesn’t quite grasp the historical political antecedents of the folks he keeps telling us are just ordinary working Canadians who want a pipeline or two, are worried about sinister United Nations plots, and, by the way, happen to blame immigrants for all their economic troubles and want the prime minster tried for treason. He seems to be prepared to do this while posing for photographs in their trucks.

Either that, or he understands who they are perfectly well, as his recycled Rebel Media advisors certainly do, a possibility that is considerably more troubling.

As for the famous aphorism above, speaking of popular music as we were, one can only hope that Mr. Scheer thinks the speaker was Carlos Santana","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

And another “foreign” oil company vacates Alberta. No one, no one, no one, has even mentioned to anyone else, that the number and frequency of oil company departures from Alberta might, just might, have something to do with the demise of the industry. Canadian banks seem to be bearing all the debt that has been amassed by the Canadian oil and gas companies that are buying up the assets left behind by those leaving. Someone within the confines of the 6 majors of Canadian banking might just be getting a tad nervous about all that debt and the continuing accumulation of such with the departure of Devon to greener pastures in the Permian. How can working stiffs continue to believe that their futures depend on an industry that is being vacated by the major investors around the world?

Red Deer is a long way from Ottawa, both physically and in other aspects. At first glance this protest might get some sympathy from in Eastern Canada, thinking it is all about struggling or unemployed oil workers. However, this hagiography tends to fray when seen from more close up or scrutinized.

First of all, the myth that Alberta is struggling so badly is an overstatement. We still have above average wages and while our unemployment rate is a bit above the national average now, our province’s rate is far from the highest. Second and more importantly, this protest does not seem to be just about building new pipelines, but seems to be a way to air a grab bag of collected grievances, some of which seem quite unrelated. It doesn’t seem to take too much for a diligent reporter to get the yellow vest crowd involved to start talking about things like banning immigration and how Trudeau should be tried for treason. Perhaps the latter is the Canadian version of “lock him up!”. If your goal is to meet with the Prime Minister, you might want to start by being less threatening and second try to focus on the issue supposedly at hand. Interestingly, the majority of Canadian political leaders did not choose to speak to this group.

I think the Prime Minister has already figured out this is basically a partisan anti Trudeau crowd and there is little or nothing to be accomplished by talking to this crowd. It also seems to be a group of protest, without constructive ideas. Yes, apparently they want us to build pipelines now, but how will that happen? The Prime Minister can not just wave a magic wand and make court cases go away and judges rule in favour of these projects. It is left to Mr. Scheer to try to compete with Mr. Bernier to appeal to the more extreme elements in this group. I would say Mr. Bernier seems to have the lead in this, he is fairly open about being against immigration, while Mr. Scheer tries to play footsie with them. Scheer wants their support and hopes their presence might hurt the Liberals, but he also hopes they don’t linger too long or say something too embarrassing that might hurt his party, which still tries to officially maintain it is ok with immigration as it courts the votes of suburban immigrants in Ontario and BC.

Unfortunately, our previous provincial governments never took diversification seriously, particularly during the recent long oil and gas booms. Perhaps the yellow jackets might get even more support from Mr. Scheer if they became dairy farmers. It seems to be a good career, but unfortunately is hard to get into. I have a feeling Mr. Bernier wouldn’t come to speak to them in that case, regardless of what they thought of immigrants, so then as a bonus Mr. Scheer might have the crowd all to himself.

I am utterly baffled by your relocation of the Red River Rebellion and the Riel Provisional Government to Saskatchewan. The Red River doesn’t even flow through Saskatchewan. I am further baffled as to why you would be dismissive of his role in Manitoba becoming a province. Manitobans consider him a Father of Manitoba and the February holiday, which for Albertans is Family Day, in Manitoba is Louis Riel Day.

It appears you didn’t even know about Riel in Manitoba until someone else pointed it out. If you had, you likely wouldn’t have written the idiotic blog. Your link is further proof that you need to do actual research before you make a blog.

I understand how you failed in politics.

Like an earlier reader, Smarter Than You seems to be confused by my reference to a historical entity known as the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan when the Red River Rebellion is principally associated with what is now the province of Manitoba. Since it is evident this reader did not follow the link provided in response to the earlier comment, I will duplicate below the entry on this topic from the Canadian Encyclopedia. I am optimistic that since he is Smarter Than You, Dear Readers, as well as me, he will recognize the value of actually reading documents he sets out to criticize.

The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan

By 1885, the North-West Mounted Police had been established, and a railway to the West almost completed, so the impetus for the Canadian government to negotiate with Métis as it had in 1870 was no longer present. Tired of waiting on Canadian action, the Batoche Métis, at a meeting on 5 March 1885, proposed to take up arms in order to compel Canada to recognize their land rights. At a meeting on 8 March 1885, Riel put forth a motion to create a provisional government for Saskatchewan. While the motion did not pass at that meeting, a 10-point “Revolutionary Bill of Rights” was drafted. It asserted Métis rights of possession to their farms, among other demands, including, “That the Land Department of the Dominion Government be administered as far as practicable from Winnipeg, so that the settlers may not be compelled as heretofore to go to Ottawa for the settlement of questions in dispute between them and the land commissioner.” After word was received that the federal government was sending 500 soldiers to Batoche in answer to the Métis petitions, on 18 March the Métis seized the parish church at Batoche, formed a provisional government — of which Riel was president — and demanded the surrender of the HBC post at Fort Carlton. The ensuing fighting lasted two months (see North-West Resistance), and although the Métis won the first of two engagements, the Canadians ultimately overwhelmed Métis soldiers, and Riel surrendered himself to the Canadian militia.

The Wikipedia, notwithstanding that institution’s limitations as an academic source, summarized the PGS as follows:
The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was an independent state declared during the North-West Rebellion of 1885 in the District of Saskatchewan of the Northwest Territories. It included parts of the present-day Canadian provinces of Alberta. Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The name was given by Louis Riel.

Here endeth the lesson. DJC

258,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,National Energy Board ruling on Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion leaves everyone deep in their message boxes,2019-02-23 02:45:00,David Climenhaga,,"Common sense would suggest the recommendation of the National Energy Board yesterday that Ottawa approve the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project despite significant risks to the environment is a small but significant step toward eventual completion of the controversial multi-billion-dollar megaproject.

But as was already evident in the immediate reaction to the NEB’s announcement in Calgary, that isn’t likely to drive the interested parties out of their message boxes any time soon. Consider this sampling from various news sources:

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley was optimistic, but cautious. “It’s not a victory, but it’s an incredibly important step,” she told reporters. “Many obstacles have been put in our way, and quite clearly we are not done yet.”

United Conservative Party Opposition Leader Jason Kenney said that the decision “doesn’t change anything.” He complained about the NEB’s addition of 16 non-binding recommendations and blamed the NDP, the federal Liberals, the B.C. Government and “U.S. funded” environmentalists for delaying the project.

B.C. NDP Environment Minister George Heyman expressed astonishment that “they found there would be significant impacts on southern resident killer whales, that there would be a catastrophic impact if there was a spill, and they reached the conclusion, astoundingly, that no new conditions were needed.”


Alberta Opposition Leader Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the things that we love, because no price can be put on the sacred,” said Rueben George of the Tsleil Waututh First Nation, one of the parties to the original legal challenge that resulted in the NEB’s first permit being quashed.

Federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, an Edmonton MP, cautiously indicated a final decision won’t be made by cabinet until consultations with impacted First Nations have been completed.

And the evening and the morning were the first day.

Expect more of the same starting today, only louder.


B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman (Photo: Facebook).

Ms. Notley’s supporters will argue the NEB recommendation would not have been made without her efforts to seek social license through her government’s climate leadership program, including its carbon levy. “Notley’s diplomacy has delivered results,” said Alberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan in a Tweet. “Kenney’s phoney machismo is risky.”

Mr. Kenney’s supporters will say the recommendations and the NEB’s acknowledgement the project carries risks of “serious adverse environmental impacts” are proof the social license approach is a failure. Some will darkly grumble that anything short of shovels in the ground by morning and a statement global climate change is a fraud proves there is a malicious conspiracy against Alberta.

Mr. Kenney and his federal counterpart, Andrew Scheer, won’t quite endorse such opinions – but they won’t discourage them either.

Some environmentalists and First Nations opponents of the pipeline will see the process as rigged in favour of TMX and its recommendations dangerously toothless. Like Mr. Heyman, they will vow to fight on in the courts of law and of public opinion.

And the federal Liberals led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will proceed with extreme caution, dotting their i’s and crossing their t’s in the consultations with First Nations demanded by the Federal Court of Appeal.


University of Alberta economist Andrew Leach (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

After all, they know that the huge amount of political and actual capital they have invested in the TMX Project has bought them nothing but hostility and abuse from almost all parties in Alberta while threatening their electoral support in other parts of the country.

That was all well and good, once upon a time, when their reelection in the fall seemed assured. Now? Not so much.

Facing a political crisis wrought by the SNC-Lavalin affair, it seems highly unlikely Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals will risk anything more in the face of the strong possibility of zero benefit anywhere from co-operation with Alberta.

Moreover, as University of Alberta economist Andrew Leach pointed out in an interesting series of Tweets yesterday, the possibility of a victory by Mr. Kenney in the imminent Alberta provincial election puts Mr. Trudeau in a position where continuing to support the pipeline is dangerous for him.


Federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Trudeau sold Ottawa’s purchase of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline and its support for the expansion project, Dr. Leach pointed out, on the strength of Ms. Notley’s practical efforts to build social license.

Dr. Leach reminded his readers of the PM’s words back in the day: “We could not have approved this project without the leadership of Premier Notley, and Alberta’s Climate Leadership Plan – a plan that commits to pricing carbon and capping oilsands emissions at 100 megatonnes per year.”

Dr. Leach asked: “What’s Justin Trudeau going to do if, by the time cabinet gets through the required consultations with First Nations communities, Alberta no longer has a carbon pricing policy as it did in 2015? The oil sands cap also remains to be formalized and seems unlikely to be so now.”

It’s an interesting question. The answer in the short term is that the prime minister will almost certainly proceed with extreme caution, at least until the federal election, and possibly until after the U.S. presidential election in the fall of 2020 as well.

If everyone continues to act as expected in the face of that, and the emerging Liberal electoral strategy unfolds as doubtless planned, it could leave forever furious Alberta the victim of its own tantrums.

“For ’tis the sport to have the enginer,” as the Bard observed, “hoist with his own petard … ”

Alas poor Stephen, I knew Mandel


Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Having metaphorically tied his shoelaces together, then fallen down, Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel’s lawyers yesterday pleaded with a judge of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench to untangle the knot and send him on his way.

That is to say, having missed deadlines for filing required financial paperwork on his and other MLAs’ candidate nomination elections, knowing full well the penalty was being banned from running for five years, he missed them anyway, was banned from running until the fall of 2023 by Elections Alberta, and now wants the ban overturned.

If the bans on Mr. Mandel and six other candidates aren’t lifted, his lawyers argued, the Alberta Party could be done like dinner. Even if they are, there’s a strong chance it will be anyway.

Mr. Mandel described his case as “very strong.” Others seem to think it’s very weak. Regardless, the judge, Madam Justice Gaylene Kendell, said she will make her decision by the end of next week","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Notley’s pipeline hysteria is going to sweep the NDP away this spring. Small price to pay if your top priority is pipelines, perhaps. At least Notley’s Big Oil masters will be happy. Maybe Cenovus can find a seat for her on its Board of Directors.
Only last May Premier Notley celebrated Trudeau’s decision to purchase Trans Mountain by giving her fellow cabinet ministers high fives. A mite premature, some pundits thought. No high fives when the Federal Court of Appeal quashed the approval a few months later.
Maybe our Premier learned something?

P.S. Any word as to whether Stephen Mandel made it to his court hearing on time?

Is it really possibly to be this obtuse?
If the NDP are defeated this spring, it won’t be because of the pipeline. It will be because 70% of the Alberta electorate has voted for conservative parties in every election since Confederation, except for the last one; and even then the NDP only got 40% of the vote. You pretend to think that there is a luring majority of left/green voters in Alberta who would have endorsed a far more radical agenda. There isn’t. The choice is an NDP government which is taking some steps in the direction of a reasonable future, or a UCP government which will tear up everything positive they have done, and reverse course. And the stakes are high….this is really the last chance to start steering the Titanic away from the iceberg. In another 10 or 20 years, it won’t matter what we do.

Who said it was? Not me.
I said “Notley’s pipeline hysteria is going to sweep the NDP away this spring.” Which does not imply that the NDP would win or have a good chance of winning without fuelling pipeline hysteria.

As I have written countless times:“Reality check: A NDP win in 2019 is not on the menu. Notley was always a one-term premier.
“The numbers indicate UCP victory is inevitable. Mathematically, it is impossible for the NDP to prevail against a united conservative party. Even the NDP’s unprecedented 2015 numbers would not yield such a result.”
Most pipeline cheerleaders would not vote NDP if Notley built a billion pipelines. Stoking Albertans’ perennial resentment over pipelines and everything else under the sun only helps the UCP.

Death and Gravity wrote: “You pretend to think that there is a luring majority of left/green voters in Alberta who would have endorsed a far more radical agenda.”

In 2015 left/green voters endorsed the NDP campaign platform including climate leadership, giving Albertans a fair share on royalties, and opposition to new export pipelines like Keystone XL. Once elected, Notley did an about-face. Despite her unflagging support for the oil industry, the NDP will lose the next election.
The AB NDP’s obsession with re-election in 2019 has led to short-sighted policy that emulates previous Conservative govts and betrays future generations.

Notley’s NDP opposed Keystone XL in 2015:“[The PCs] squandered Alberta’s natural resource wealth… and have focused only on more export pipelines for unprocessed bitumen – sending our jobs to Texas.”
The NDP now proposes to send jobs to California, Washington State, and Asia — as well as Texas.

Death and Gravity wrote: “The choice is an NDP government…”

Reality check: A NDP win in 2019 is not on the menu. Even you agree that “70% of the Alberta electorate” is staunchly “conservative”. UCP victory is inevitable.
The only choice for NDP supporters is whether to endorse or repudiate Notley’s oilsands expansion agenda, which prevents Canada from meeting its (inadequate) emissions targets for decades.
I didn’t vote for oilsands expansion and climate failure in 2015. Not going to vote for disaster in 2019 either.

Under current leadership, the AB NDP and the federal Liberals will NEVER take us where we need to go.
AB’s drive for fossil fuel growth is IRREVOCABLE. There is no redemption. No going back. No path from oilsands expansion to lower emissions and Canada’s climate targets. No tweaks of NDP policy can get us to where we need to go.
You don’t build pipelines and new oilsands projects only to run them for a decade. Oilsands infrastructure, including pipelines, takes decades to recoup its costs.

My hope is that going into the 2023 election the AB NDP will return to its roots and choose the bold, science-literate leadership AB desperately needs in the 21st century. No way will Notley lead a decimated NDP in 2023.
That doesn’t imply NDP victory next time. But AB progressives can once more stand on the right side of science and history. Trying to out-conservative the “conservatives” will never, ever be a winning strategy for the NDP.

Re the pipeline decision: one path forward for the Trudeau gov’t, as the new owners of the project, might be to hire SNC to build it … lol ;-).

Re Mandel: the strongest argument in favour of his position is that it was a purely administrative misstep: he didn’t spend any money on his nomination campaign, so the zero return expense report was a pure paperwork exercise, with no real significance in the electoral process and no concern about improper fundraising or spending. However, the fact it was a zero return is also a mark against him: he & his team could have just signed it all off the day after his nomination was confirmed and gotten it out of the way. Missing the generous deadline was just stupid.

Still don’t get how a pipeline is going to help Alberta since most of the troubles in the oilpatch stem from low oil prices. Getting “our oil to the marketplace” will only increase the supply of oil and exert downward pressure on prices.

Having somebody named “Trudeau” in the PMO doesn’t help matters much either. Like throwing red meat into a pen of starving dogs. Sending a truck convoy to Ottawa and demanding action to help the oilsands doesn’t help other. As if Justin has magical powers to raise the price of oil.

It didn’t take Jason Kenney long to put into play the standard boilerplate responses from the tried and true UCP playbook — yell louder and stamp your feet harder. Employing the usual conservative bromides and tropes, Kenney now feels emboldened heading into the election with the delay of TMX — though perhaps falsely.

While Alberta and Canada are in a holding pattern on the TMX, perhaps now is the time to take prudent steps to move our resources by rail to refineries in the U.S. and Canada. Oh I forgot— yes Notley has already done that, much to the consternation of Mr. Kenney who apparently for some uncompromising ideological reason, continues to root against Alberta. He’s even gone so far as to threaten to rip up the contracts signed by the current government, if he’s elected premier. For his myopic vision on this file, one can only hope he pays a severe political price come Election Day.

It almost seems like “death by delays.” Again, perhaps, it is what is not being said by federal and provincial politicians and what they know about what is stated below, is a ‘letting down easy’ of what is to come or, has already, come.
Just a few days ago, U.S.-based Devon Energy announced it will be selling off its oilsands assets and going south of the border. Other companies “who have reduced their exposure to the oilsands include” Norway’s Statoil, Arkansas-based Murphy Oil, France’s Total SA, Houston-based ConacoPhillips and Netherlands based Royal Dutch Shell. They are all gearing to lower-cost production. More can be read here about the oil/tar sands ‘weak business case:’

Another unspoken economic elephant-in-the-room described is “one supertanker port (LOOP) has turned global oil economics upside down,” and again, it is being said, will definitely negatively/already has, affected Alberta oil. and, quote from the article: “There is no business case for an expansion of Alberta’s oil sands/tarsands on the scale needed to justify the Keystone XL and Trans-Mountain export pipelines because of one bare fact: there are zero foreign buyers who today will commit to decades-long purchase contracts for unrefined bitumen at a fixed price of US$80 per barrel.”
Perhaps, talk is cheap re: keeping up the hope that pipelines will be built, while keeping pipeline supporting voters on a string….understandably due to the folks who still feel that their financial future iis dependent on it.
What maybe cannot come soon enough is the transition to the $trillion dollar renewable tech revolution which is already happening, from fossil fuel power to renewable energy power (reminiscent of horse power to fossil fuel power) which is being estimated to generate millions of jobs globally.
If money talks, are we falling behind with not capitalizaing more, on Canada’s massive renewable resources? Will we let foreign interests control our massive renewable resources? We need to be much more strict about that….like Peter Lougheed said about developing resources, “Behave like an owner.”

Albertan: thank you for the excellent link to the article about transportation economics and tar sands exports.

It makes sense for an owner to sell a high quality product into premium world markets. It is a fool’s errand to try doing what the UCP and NDP are claiming to want – nobody really wants a mixture of sand, tar, and solvents at any price these days.

The NDP should have told Albertans the truth about the Province’s post Klein economic prospects when they took office. Now that the NDP have missed that opportunity, we can only hope that the UCP somehow bungle the election. If they take power Alberta will end up as a rather unpleasant version of Louisiana without the interesting cuisine.

Tzeporah Berman said “The reconsideration process failed the most basic public participation standards.” She also said it is not in the public interest and “it will not be built. She certainly didn’t agree with the NEB’s latest decision. With the Trudeau government facing the continuing spectacle of the SNC Lavelin affair and the upcoming trial of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman all in an election year polling numbers in Quebec and B.C. will factor heavily in their decision. Six months ago the re-election of the federal Liberal’s looked like a sure thing, now it would certainly appear they are slipping into minority territory at best. There is nothing for them to gain in the aforementioned provinces by pushing the approval ahead and in my opinion will push this decision past the next election. Enjoy your day.

Thank you, Brian. I’m indeed having a wonderful day. For once we are mostly in agreement. You are right that here is very little to gain for the Liberals to persuade them to push TMX ahead. As for the SNC-Lavalin affair and the Norman trial, it is interesting that the Conservatives are trying to cast the government’s reluctance to comment as evidence of perfidy when there are clear reasons related to the rule of law that that they cannot be completely open, especially in the latter case, which is, as they say, before the courts. As for SNC-Lavalin, it is already unravelling as a scandal. Then there are the truck rallies, both pathetically small and heavily influenced by neo-Nazis, with Andrew Scheer out there cheering on these creeps and their violent rhetoric. Anything’s possible in politics, but I would think a Conservative victory in Ottawa remains a long shot. DJC

David while we both agree that there is little to be gained by the federal Liberal’s pushing ahead with TMX that is where our agreement ends. As far as the SNC Lavelin affair goes, JWR has yet to speak her truth and it is certainly obvious to me she was from her perspective pressured by the PMO to give SNC Lavelin a remediation agreement. I certainly doen’t think this scandal is unravelling. The Vice-Admiral’s case is supposed to go to trial in August and this case in my opinion had a lot to do with Scott Brison retiring from federal politics, a retirement that brought the SNC Lavelin case into the spotlight. The Vice-Admiral’s lawyer Marie Henein is certainly an outstanding lawyer that will leave no stone unturned! One’s view of the truck rally to Ottawa depends on your outlook. From my point of view it was mostly about objections to Bill C-48 and C-69 and the carbon tax and a general dissatisfaction with Justin Trudeau’s policies and governance. To say it was heavily influenced by Neo-Nazis is in my opinion blatantly false. The poor performance to this point by Jagmeet Singh certainly hasn’t helped Andrew Scheer. Guy Caron or Charlie Angus would have been a much more effective choice imo. And again, enjoy your day.

I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the CPC minions were discussing the advisability of Andrew Scheer addressing the rally. Associating himself with the neo-Nazi element of the rallies does come with a bit of a political price. At the same time, I am sure not addressing the crowd would be seen as a betrayal by the pipeline crowd. I wonder if the possibility of losing votes to Maxime Bernier was the deciding factor.

I would add to DJC’s response that Ontario has traditionally and fairly reliably counterbalanced its federal partisanship against its provincial. I should think the trend would feature some extra support for the Liberals due to regrets Ontarians feel about electing the odious buffoon Premier Doug Ford who, BTW, will probably insinuate himself into the federal contest to Scheer’s detriment.

I think one of the harshest thrashings the Liberals are gonna take is in BC but, for all that, a total loss in BC is still only 17 seats. If the Liberals are also wiped out in Alberta and Saskatchewan the total for the three westernmost provinces is still only 25 seats. JT has apparently calculated the likely BC losses are politically affordable, knowing full well the nucleus of opposition to his TMX push is where all but one of his 17 BC seats are: Greater Vancouver—and that opposition could be described as ‘nuclear’ in intensity.

We’ll see tomorrow (Moon Day) how NDP leader Jagmeet Singh does in his Burnaby by-election bid: if he wins, the prospects of the NDP picking up lost Liberal seats will have improved. I expect the Greens to continue trending upwards and Lower Mainland BC and Vancouver Island remain their best bets. In short, I don’t expect the Conservatives to be the only beneficiaries of Liberal losses in BC. And, again, it doesn’t amount to much in any case.

I fully agree with DJC that Scheer’s endorsement of the neo-nazi backed truck rally is not an accolade for the Conservatives—in my view it is an astonishingly foolish negative that most Canadians reject categorically. Scheer should have condemned, not embraced, these odious wolf-mutts. Remember, the Cons are not generally loved, are divided, moribund, poorly led and dogged by Scheer’s runner-up competitor for leadership who will certainly drain critical votes away from them. One wonders if Scheer endorsed the anti-immigrant truck rally to stem this leakage of support (Bernier having already welcomed bigots to his own anti-immigrant flag)—but it was jaw-droppingly idiotic for him to do so and yet one more indication that he’s a bad leader of a party with serious internal problems.

Remember, too, it was Stephen Harper’s niqab ploy that drove the last nail into his losing campaign’s coffin. Canadians generally do not accept racist antics like that and its subsequent association with Trump’s deplorables since Harper’s defeat should have warned Scheer away—indeed, should have advised him to distance himself and his party explicitly, in no uncertain terms.

That’s a huge factor in the upcoming federal contest and it doesn’t bode well for the Conservatives. Liberal minority? I don’t expect anything close to that.

It can be dangerous to put all your eggs in one political basket. The Liberals pay more attention to suburban Toronto and Vancouver because even though they do not always reliably vote Liberal, there is a decent chance they can win there – in Fort McMurray or Fort Macleod, not very likely.

I think winning four seats in Alberta gave the Liberals in the last election gave them a a bit of hope, but the never ending stream of crankiness and cantankerousness coming from Alberta in the last six months has probably caused them to rethink all that. Its kind of like a spouse that only whines and complains, after a while you just tune it out and eventually stop trying to please them. The Yellow Jacket truckers even blew their chance to get a face to face meeting with the Prime Minister with their over the top comments about immigration and the Prime Minister’s supposed treason. Whatever sympathy there was for Alberta before in Ottawa has probably diminished considerably and the consensus has probably now tilted to are Albertans raving lunatics? I doubt the Federal Liberals will want to risk much more political capital on a province that can’t seem to be pleased and will focus their efforts in places where there is a possibility they may win. Unfortunately for Albertans some of these places are not very pipeline friendly.

I still have to wonder whether Mandel’s self sabotage is intentional or perhaps it was one of those subconscious things. It must have become apparent to him by now that the Alberta Party was really not catching fire and he was headed for another potentially embarrassing defeat to likely end his political career. Why bother to spend all the time, effort and money over the next few months just to end up in such a position? Perhaps it was better to skip all that and find a quick way out. Its going to be embarrassing either way, so maybe it is best to cut his losses now. After all, how difficult could it be to fill in a form with supposedly all zeros? If his financial officer was not up to filling it out, surely someone else could do it and then go over to his home, office or hospital bed with flowers or chocolates and a get well card if necessary, to get the requisite signature.

The former PC’s sure had their share of administrative snafus running the government over the years, but the party itself at least generally seemed to be able to get election forms in by the deadlines, as other parties also seem to be able to do. All this only serves to confirm the suspicions many Albertans already have that the Alberta Party is just not quite up to it. At this point, it probably doesn’t matter so much what the judge will say, the verdict of the voters will not be sympathetic.

It’s rude of me to mention this just now, of course, but you have to admit something like this could very well happen. After all, only 547 votes separated the two parties in the last federal election, when becoming mayor of Vancouver was still just a twinkle in the eye of the former New Democrat MP for the riding, Kennedy Stewart.

NDP candidate Jagmeet Singh has not exactly been a sterling success since Canada’s New Democrats made him their party’s leader in October 2017. His recent positions on several issues have been assailed, not without justice, as nearly incoherent.

Since there is no guarantee the 40-year-old former Ontario MPP and deputy Ontario NDP leader will do any better as a Member of Parliament, New Democrats can be forgiven for growing increasingly fearful about how Mr. Singh might perform in The House of Commons.

If he wins and then doesn’t improve his game, disaster may await the NDP in the fall general election.

Liberals could be forgiven too if they conclude based on Mr. Singh’s performance as party leader over the past 16 months that nothing would be more likely to help their party in the looming federal general election than having him lead the NDP in the House and into the campaign.

The Liberals should have been a deadbolt cinch to win the upcoming election without the requirement for help from Mr. Singh or anyone else.


Environmentalist and maybe, sorta, someday NDP leadership candidate Avi Lewis (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The national economy has been performing well, and Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer looks like a lame version of Stephen Harper, who remains a Conservative éminence grise and a negative factor for voters.

The thought of Mr. Harper ruling at one remove is anathema to most rank and file New Democrats and Liberals alike, no matter what kind of long game some NDP strategists may wish to play. So Mr. Scheer shouldn’t have been much of a threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau even without the sour grapes Tea Party uprising against the Conservative leader led by his former rival Maxime Bernier and his so-called People’s Party of Canada.

But that was before the Prime Minister’s Office bungled the SNC-Lavalin affair and the related demotion and resignation of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould so badly it tossed the hapless Mr. Scheer and his strategic brain trust of ex-Rebel-Media hacks an unexpected lifeline.

Until recently, the PMO’s handling of this ongoing meltdown has been so ham-handed it will probably go down in history as a case study of how not to deal with a political crisis!

As a result, the Liberals are probably lucky their last candidate in Burnaby South, the injudicious Karen Wang, had to be sent packing for what was widely interpreted as a racist comment about Mr. Singh. The Liberal standard bearer in the by-election is now Richard Lee, a former MLA for the B.C. Liberals, who, readers should remember, are really conservatives.

Some political analysts have suggested the Liberal turmoil will help Mr. Singh. But, remember, nearly 40 per cent of the population of the riding is of Chinese origin, and Ms. Wang’s undiplomatic remarks notwithstanding, that may end up being a significant factor today.

If Mr. Singh is declared elected tonight, I imagine we won’t hear for a little while from ambitious high-profile New Democrats with leadership potential.

It seems likely, though, that some of them will nevertheless start making discreet moves behind the scenes in anticipation of Mr. Singh’s performance continuing to be as underwhelming in the House as it has been up to now outside of it.

If Mr. Singh is not elected, we will probably be hearing sooner than later from the likes of Nathan Cullen, who sat out the last NDP leadership race, and the ambitious Avi Lewis, scion of one of the founding families of the NDP, who has been extremely quiet of late. And what is Svend Robinson doing back in the country all of a sudden?

Sadly, in selecting Mr Singh so overwhelmingly, federal NDP members went for shiny & new instead of tried & true, and the NDP is now becoming increasingly irrelevant in national politics. The roots of the NDP were as a western agrarian populist movement, the CCF, which sought to break the stranglehold of big business on Prairie farmers’ livelihoods during the Great Depression. And yet, its modern successor, the NDP, is trailing far behind the other two legacy parties in the three Prairie provinces. If LEAP co-author Avi Lewis were to become NDP leader, it would probably be shut out of the Prairies altogether.

In the early 1960s, the CCF hitched its wagon to the Canadian labour movement, forging the modern NDP. And, for years, it was not only the “conscience of Parliament”, but saw many of its key priorities implemented by various minority Liberal governments, and even the occasional majority—remember the Canada Health Act—led by Mike Pearson and Pierre Trudeau. But now, it has lost its way and has virtually no traction amongst working Canadians. It has failed to communicate to ordinary working Canadians that voting for the chameleons of Canadian politics—aka the Liberals—or the increasingly doctrinaire Conservatives, is counter to their own best interests. Instead, it has embraced the ultimate expression of NIMBY-ism, known as BANANA-ism: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything, even though building stuff puts people to work.

So, where are moderately progressive, pro-worker voters to turn? There are the pseudo-progressive Liberals, who are just kinder, gentler Tories who perhaps don’t have white hoods stashed in their closets, but are really no different on fundamental policy from the old-style PCs; there are the neo-fascist Conservatives, who are so far removed from their PC forebears that Brian Mulroney, Joe Clark, et. al. should sue them for trademark infringement; there are the Greens, who appeal to such a narrow tranche of voters they will never form a national government; and there is the NDP, who have lost sight of the fact that in order to get your way on policy you first have to get elected. It’s enough to make you want to tear your hair out.

Not to make your hair loss worse, but I would say your characterization of the prairies populism, post WW1 is a bit thin! My family were homesteaders’ at the turn of the century, and several were communists on up to the sixties. The last being a grand matriarch, who claimed and demanded that the “Co-op” was “the store”! Of course that was at the expense of my father who opened an independent and lit the fuse of a bloodless revolution in my family! I to this day, respect communists. Not because I am one, or want to be one, but because I admire the reality that they conveyed in their purest expression of decency and common good! So did my parents and many others when we supported “Healthcare”! It’s okay! We don’t expect any thanks!

First, let’s not confuse the federal and provincial New Democratic parties; yes, they are ‘federated’ but there’s one big difference: because the federal party has little chance of becoming government, it naturally takes on the more idealistic position —the “conscience” of Canadian politcs as which it has always punched much higher than its weight. If LEAP is to ever have any influence it is in the Commons, not provincial legislatures which, being viable contenders for power, eschew LEAP explicitly in no uncertain terms.

You corrected your notion that the NDP is rooted in Prairie socialism that married Great Depression humanitarianism with agrarian cooperatives —in church, nota bene; the federated NDP is, as you note, is a cooperative amalgam of ethical Christian socialial activism with the trade union movement which is concentrated in the manufactories of the East and resource mills across non-agrarian regions of the nation. When led from the economic centre, Lewis, Broadbent and Layton won the NDP to its greatest successes; in contrast, the party languished to the point of schism when led from the peripheries (it might be mere happenstance that those doldrums coincided with ‘affirmative action’ leadership, a laudable policy and one which could be said to have inspired more women to run for every party—the conscience of Canadian federal politics striking again). Farmers in the agrarian regions, in contrast, only get as close to unionism as grain marketing boards and wheat pools. Yet it’s instructive to note the distinction between federal and provincial NDP in this respect: there has hardly been a time during the past eight decades when one of the Prairie provinces wasn’t governed by a typically provincial NDP party. We might emphasize that, in spite of the federal NDP’s electoral disappointment in the most recent contest, two Western provinces subsequently elected NDP governments—one for the first time. Neither does the right have a lock on Saskatchewan and Manitoba, both having had important NDP regimes—indeed, even iconic—in the not-so-distant past.

Let us admit that, again, the two levels of our split loyalty are remarkably distinct, brand-name and federality notwithstanding: When the federal NDP convention (which includes provincial parties) entertained the LEAP manifesto, it wasn’t but a few hours before BC Premier Horgan denounced it categorically.<> We hardly need guess what Alberta’s NDP government thinks of LEAP.

It’s important to note that the official NDP government opposition to TMX, protecting BC’s inside waters from dilbit spills is being pressed at the very same time Horgan and JT (ostensible TMX enemies) gleefully shake hands on the largest fossil-fuel resource investment deal in Canadian history, the massive LNG export facility in Kitimat, proposed terminus for the failed Northern Gateway dilbit pipeline. This seeming contradiction not only refutes your characterization of NIMBY-“BANANA-ism,” but it is the central political circumstance bedeviling every polity these day, and especially the NDP.

Global ecological degradation and wealth disparity (and, in many nations, probably-resultant racism, manifest in Canada mainly by the experiences of Aboriginal nations) are challenging every polity. Three decade-old neoliberal usurpation of moribund traditional conservatism has been revealed responsible for much of this global dilemma, and now resorts to extremism in its own discreditation (encapsulated as climate-change denial and racism); Canadian Liberal parties, partly stung by this Geckoid neoliberalism and influenced by refugees from increasingly extreme conservative parties they have accommodated have moved markedly to the right. Electoral frustration in addition to increasing environmental anxieties and dwindling prosperity are being increasingly availed by the Greens whose legitimacy increases regardless the reason voters vote for them, whether for bona fide environmental concerns or incidental, ‘none-of-the-above’ protest votes. Thus, where there appears to be room for the NDP to shoehorn itself into this spectrum, it also finds the ‘paradigm shift’ as trying and divisive as any other party. As Mulcair found out, the party membership rather interprets any drift to the right, even on the general politcal ice-floe moving every party, as cutting its nose off to spite its highly ideological face. At the same time, defending its traditional worker base, a significant part of which works in resource development, seems to have resulted in significant traditional support eroding to the Greens. BC’s NDP is a case in point: to stem some of this trend, it was forced to promise an electoral reform referendum to blunt the BC Greens’ main campaign platform—even though proportional representation would have provided itself little advantage; as it was, the Greens tripled their seats to three and secured the balance of power in the resulting NDP minority government, despite serious policy differences with respect resource development (the Greens may be said to be the NIMBY cats, not the NDP. And pro-rep was convincingly rejected at Referendum). Long mischaracterized as the teleological ‘extreme left’ by its rivals, the NDP is most assuredly, if uncomfortably, bookended by its ideological rivals.

Today’s question is almost entirely tactical for the NDP: depending on the by-election outcome, the NDP may be forced to consider its longterm strategy, but it will continue to be buffeted by global circumstances like all the other parties. Remind that Avi Lewis’ LEAP is highly contentious within the party—but only at the federal, ‘conscience-of-parliament’ level (it’s been mooted as an issue provincially); as well, the old, scarred warhorse Svend Robinson cut at least some of his teeth on the NPI (New Politics Initiative) he and a small party cabal fomented during a raucous national convention under Alexa Mcdonough’s Leadership, the most serious potential schism since the Waffel. These divisive personalities might work dangerously upon the circumstantial fissure the NDP is already struggling with. In the event Jagmeet loses today’s by-election, the potential for a real mess exists if Mulcair’s ouster is any indication: personally, I’m afraid of what might happen. I was disgusted how the party treated the man who led it to the second highest number of seats in party history, who maintained a significant beachhead in Quebec without which the NDP—like any party—has absolutely no hope of federal success, who whipped Harper’s ass every day in the Commons and who made the NDP the most popular party in the nation for the first time ever. The effectively leadersless party also made an embarrassing hash of the ill-fated electoral reform committee (the NDP contingent headed by the petulant Nathan Cullen whose maudlin tantrums drove polling numbers downward until the committee’s work was done and they began to slowly recover—that is, after he’d been thus shut up). And then members churlishly rebuffed Charlie Angus—easily the most qualified leadership contender—for the shiny, new and painfully novice Mr Singh.

I remain a member—somewhat begrudgingly (because of some of our BC governmet’s policies)—but understand the difference between federal and provincial parties. The real struggle is always at the provincial level where sovereignty over resources is at and the NDP is a viable contender for government. At the federal level, no matter what happens, I do not expect the NDP to become government: I expect it to be the conscience of parliament and continue to force progressive policy upon the bigger parties. The only way it could ever be different, in my view, is if the Cons self-destructed entirely. But I’m not a dreamer like Harper or many of my party comrades. I see a real future for the NDP.

255,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"Has a UCP candidate voiced what her party really thinks, its leader’s pledge notwithstanding, about two-tier health care",2019-02-26 01:09:00,David Climenhaga,,"If you wonder what the United Conservative Party really thinks about how health care ought to be run in Alberta, perhaps you should ask if Miranda Rosin instead of Jason Kenney, he of the Coroplast Pledge.

Ms. Rosin is the UCP’s candidate in the new Banff-Kananaskis riding. Mr. Kenney is the party’s leader, of course, and as we now know, its Decider as well.

The plastic pledge mentioned above was Mr. Kenney’s Canadian Taxpayers Federation style stunt last week in which he publicly signed a “Public Health Care Guarantee” on a large sheet of plastic saying his party is committed to “maintain a universally accessible, publicly funded health care system.”

Taking the pledge resulted a certain amount of derision, owing to the fact Mr. Kenney’s “Grassroots Guarantee,” wherein he promised always to listen to what the grassroots members of his party had to say, became defunct the instant it became inconvenient.

By contrast, Ms. Rosin is just one of the troops – who in the UCP are expected to mind their Ps and Qs and do whatever the leader tells them to do.

Her suddenly controversial words were spoken at a UCP nomination-candidates’ meeting in Canmore back on Oct. 17, before what was by definition a friendly crowd. Alas for her, one of those ubiquitous smartphone recorders was running somewhere in the room and her words were duly taken down to be used against her.

This is as it should be. No politician of any party should doubt in the early years of the 21st century that a digital recorder is running somewhere in the room, and not just at public meetings. If you’re going to run for public office, as the old lawyers’ advice goes, you really need to “govern yourself accordingly.”

The key part of what Ms. Rosin said about health care was this: … “we need to look at a two-tiered system, so that we can get those who have worked hard for their money to get out of the system if they would like to.” (Emphasis added.)

When the recording started appearing on social media yesterday morning, Tweeted by Banff-Cochrane NDP MLA Cameron Westhead, who is a Registered Nurse and will be running in the new riding in the spring, the reaction was immediate and harsh. Ms. Rosin’s remarks and her selection as the UCP’s candidate led to the inevitable conclusion that party insiders do in fact want to allow the wealthy to opt out of our public health care system. What’s more, it would seem they don’t really put much stock in the idea that not everyone in Alberta who works hard for their money necessarily makes a lot of the stuff.

The second thought may be more offensive, but the policy question is more serious, because as any health care expert will tell you, that way disaster lies. Whatever Ms. Rosin believes, and whatever Mr. Kenney really thinks, and whatever the Fraser Institute keeps telling us, the result of allowing the wealthy to opt out or just opt upward for some nice extra fees will result in longer wait times and worse outcomes for the rest of us.

The audio clip in circulation is very short, only seven seconds. However, a longer and more contextual clip of Ms. Rosin’s response to her questioners, who went on to choose her as their candidate, is no more reassuring.

In the less tightly edited version, she begins by saying that Alberta has “one of the highest funded health cares in Canada, if not the world, and our service is not up to par, we have long wait times, there’s so many gaps in the system.

“So,” she continues, “I think that there’s two big things we need to look at. One of them, we are very bureaucracy run. I think we need to look at reducing our administration so we can get more front-line workers out there.

“But also, I think we need to look at a two-tiered system, so we can get those who work hard for their money to get out of the system if they would like to. To remove* themselves so that we can decrease the wait times for those who are still in the public system. Because this allows those who work for their money and who want to spend it how they can on health care if that’s what they need. And it also hopes those who are in the public system get shorter wait times.”

(The word marked with an asterisk is almost inaudible. It sounds to me like “remove.” Then again, maybe not. Regardless, Ms. Rosin’s thought is clear.)

It is a common misconception about public health care to conclude that removing some patients from the public system will shorten wait times for the rest.

Experience in Europe and the United States, however, shows that private hospitals and clinics cherry pick the easiest cases, dumping the more complex ones on the public system – in other words, on taxpayers and the sick themselves.

People who make this argument also act as if physicians are an unlimited resource. As is well understood, however, they are not, and if some of them choose to cherry pick well-off or easy patients, those that remain in the public system will soon be overwhelmed, degrading the public system further. In some cases, fatally so.

It is also worth remembering, when comparing systems, that health care in the United States, which much more closely approaches the pure market ideal espoused by Mr. Kenney and his supporters than does Canada’s public health insurance, costs taxpayers vastly more and yet still, even with Obamacare, leaves millions uninsured and millions more desperately under-insured.

Finally, it turns out it is utterly false to say as Mr. Kenney does, apparently taking his cue from the old Wildrose Party, that management at Alberta Health Services is bureaucratic and inefficient. In fact, it has the lowest health service administrative costs in Canada.

But that Ms. Rosin’s understanding of health economics is flawed is only a small part of the story here. That her misconceptions pass muster with her constituency association is more troubling, and that they undoubtedly reflect what the party’s leadership would like to do is even more so.

She has done us all a service, though, by leaving us a hint of what her party really thinks – which was certainly not the impression she was aiming for on Feb. 20, when she spoke in a Facebook post about Mr. Kenney’s public health care guarantee. “The NDP’s vitriolic, fear-mongering attacks that a new UCP government will slash healthcare spending and privatize the entire system can officially be put to rest,” she said then.

Well, apparently not. Too bad about that old recording!

The UCP all-candidates’ meeting was covered by the Rocky Mountain Outlook, a community news site in the area, but for some reason no mention was made in the story of Ms. Rosin’s newsworthy thoughts on public health care.

Jagmeet Singh victorious in Burnaby South


NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, victorious in the Burnaby South by-election last night (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Jagmeet Singh appeared to have cruised to victory in the Burnaby South By-election last night, which as noted in this space yesterday is about half the battle for the NDP leader. He still needs to show he can lead the party effectively from the floor of the House of Commons, lest the Orange wave of 2011 go out with the tide in the fall of 2019.

Arguably, that would be a worse fate for the NDP – or at least a bigger disappointment – than seeing a leader falter in a West Coast by-election. And there was a sign last night the tide may indeed be receding, given the Liberal victory in former leader Tom Mulcair’s old Quebec riding, Outremont.

In York-Simcoe, north of Toronto, the Conservative candidate won handily.

But despite that victory, the showing by the far-right People’s Party of Canada in Burnaby South, with about 12 per cent of the vote to the Conservatives’ 22 per cent could be a troubling augury for the Conservatives if Maxime Bernier’s Tea Party North maintains that kind of momentum into the fall","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

I remember when Obama was running for re-election and there was a point in the campaign when his opponent Romney was doing his best to portray himself as that rare, perhaps mythical creature – the kinder, gentler compasionate conservative and it seemed to be working. Then, speaking to a room of supporters in an unguarded moment, Romney said what he really thought and self inflicted a lot of damage which he never really recovered from. All of which the public found out about because of a cell phone recording.

Now, the damage here will not be so great as it is not the leader or someone close to him, but we are getting a glimpse of what the UCP really thinks, despite Kenney’s health care “guarantee”, which many already suspect is not worth the plastic it is written on. Kennney I suspect is too clever and too experienced as a politician to say what he thinks even to a supposedly friendly crowd, or is he? Cell phones are even more common than in Romney’s time. Tricky Dick was supposedly also very clever and he only had one recording device to worry about, which he was already aware of to and yet he still fell into his own trap. Oh a penny, or I guess these days a nickle at least, for Kenney’s true thoughts on health care.

I suppose Singh will now get a full chance to be on the national stage, after a comfortable win in the by election. I sort of wonder how many Liberals voted for him. In any event, a win is a win and I think he has been under estimated for quite a while. Funny how the Liberals were initially so worried about him and not very concerned about Scheer, now it has shifted completely the other way. I expect with Singh now having a voice as an MP things will shift back a bit. Scheer will no longer have a monopoly as the voice of the opposition and Scheer may now also have Bernier and the Peoples Party to worry about more.

With regards to the by-elections last night, Eric Grenier wrote a fairly convincing piece a few weeks ago showing data that supported his premise that, in recent history, whenever the Conservatives have won a federal election is has come with a strong showing by the NDP. Given Jagmeet Singh’s showing so far, the CPC should be concerned.

The CPC should also be worried that their candidate in Outremont could only manage a fifth place showing, losing to both the Green Party candidate and the Bloc candidate, in addition to the Liberal and NDP.

“And it is also hopes that those who are in the public system will get shorter wait times.” Ms. Rosin’s remark would be laughable if it weren’t so ridiculous. In Australia where two tier medicine prevails, the more entrenched you are in the public system, the longer you wait. Those with private insurance go to the head of the line, get the best doctors and preferred hospital treatment.
The UCP candidate for Banff-Kananaskis needs a lesson in how two tier health care really works although she and her leader likely know.

NDP dodged a bullet yesterday. Jagmeet won his party’s most critical election since it lost Official Opposition status almost four years ago. Even though it was a pretty convincing win, one still has to say, “Whew!”

I found Mr Singh’s locution last night somewhat stiff and, perhaps in the excitement of the night, a bit nervous. Still, he did touch all the bases, as stilted as it was. He also made several curious reverse-meaning slips—trying to avoid double negatives, maybe? (That’s usually the purview of bumpkins like me.)

What about the People’s Party? In the small and fuzzy sample of three by-elections only eight moths away from a general election, it’s probably not particularly indicative of anything in general—its 11% vote-share of the typically low-turnout exercise in Burnaby can’t confidently be compared to its paltry showings in the two, concurrent Eastern by-elections (including one in Bernier’s home province). Burnaby’s result rather reflects the Conservatives’ traditionally low popularity in this riding. BC hasn’t elected any provincial conservatives —by that name—for over 60 years and, despite the considerable political tumult of the past 17 or 18 years, the BC Conservative party hasn’t gained any electoral purchase at all. The concurrent transitions from Socred to BC Liberal and Progressive Conservative to Reform (both Socreds and PCs were wiped out after losing power) to Alliance to HarperCon were bumpy, not much love lost between BC voters and the HarperCons—as Chuck Cadman’s Independent win after Harper refused to sign his incumbency papers showed—and of course the loss of half of the HarperCons BC seats in the last federal election, coupled with the BC Liberals’ defeat last year suggest the somewhat mercurial relationship between BC voters with all parties of the right continues as normal. Unlike the traditional partisan inertia in Alberta, it’s been right-wing whack-a-mole in BC since Day One (all in order to shut out the “Socialist Hordes”—usually with success). The People’s Party fits right in there—whatever “there” means in this wonky province.

Yes, of course people will say Bernier’s upstart party revealed something about his former copartisan Andrew Scheer’s leadership and his Con party’s general prospects. Given the Ontario by-election went to a Conservative, I don’t think one should over-generalize. It doesn’t take any particular genius to appreciate that the People’s Party will steal some votes from the Cons in the upcoming contest—Bernier did win virtually half of the Con memebers’ Leadership votes, after all. So long’s both these politcal enemies vie for the bigot vote—like they have with the neo-nazi-infested truckers’ rally to Ottawa last week—they can be conveniently stuffed in the same envelope and returned to sender. I’m good with that.

I’m also good with Jagmeet Singh’s victory, yet I can’t help but be a harsh critic of my own party and I get the feeling there’ll prob’ly be enough to criticize on Singh’s account in the coming Commons probation period. Alls I can say is: I hope he takes his lessons early and well—this honeymoon’s already way old and will lose its shine all the quicker for that.

It’s really no surprise that the NDP failed to retain Mulcair’s vacated seat in Montreal. That can’t be attributed to Mr Singh’s leadership. The two men are miles apart in so many ways.

I have to admit: I kinda enjoy living in such “interesting times.” It’s a curse, I know.

We already have a two tiered healthcare system, has anyone needed an MRI lately? Wait 6 months in the public system or a week in the private system. Physio therapy needed? Same story wait or pay and get treated right away. There is also the option to go south of the border or further for medical care. The real problem as I see it is similar to education which is funneling public funds to private companies then blocking access through charging fees over and above.
Perhaps the NDP should show what the true cost of providing public services are. We know the healthcare system costs around $7,500 per person in Alberta to run but what does urban care cost and what does rural care cost. The same with education, the rural busing grant is more than twice the urban one for example.

No one should be surprised that the Conservatives are hiding their election agenda when it comes to health care or other policies. This is how they do politics. This is how Klein did things and this is how team Harper/Kenney did things federally. Kenney is an old school politician that does things the undemocratic old way, by not being forthcoming about what he aims to do in the Province before he becomes elected.

Kenney’s team will do what ever it takes to win. That includes anti-democratic moral corruption by not honestly discussing his vision for Alberta. He knows he would not win otherwise.

This makes the UCP = United Corruption Party from my perspective.

If we lived in a real democracy, where people had the right and freedom of choice to vote on bills before the Legislative Assembly, then we would not have to worry about misleading politicians, like Kenney, who want to form the Province in their way rather than the way the people actually want it formed.

I believe If these people that want the health care system like the USA, go see for themselves what they’re getting into. Take your families where they have this kind of health care. This is the thing, you only get to have a regular job to raise your family yes you can get the health insurance if you think that will help you and if you can afford it on a regular pay. Go put yourselves and your families through that stress and degrading situations.

I lived there for 2 years and as long as you don’t get sick you can get by. I don’t believe someone’s life needs to change just because they got sick.

The USA is desperately trying to get out from under that kind of health care system and here comes Canada to jump right in. Total Greed what are all you rich badtards going to do when your money cant get you through.

250,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Will Alberta conservatives blame Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau for Line 3 delays in Minnesota? Of course they will,2019-03-03 01:34:00,David Climenhaga,,"Will Alberta’s conservatives find a way to blame Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the delays in construction Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 Expansion announced yesterday?

Why not? Given the credulity demonstrated by Alberta’s mainstream media when it comes to such stories, such an effort should get plenty of ink, or at least its virtual equivalent.


Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (Photo: United States Congress, Public Domain).

After all, conservatives have happily labelled a failure the Alberta NDP’s strategy of placating Canadian pipeline opposition with a combination of environmental measures designed to lower the province’s carbon footprint and a public influence campaign. And they widely circulate claims Liberals in Ottawa have actually used the Canadian regulatory process to stall the Trans Mountain Pipeline and kill Calgary-based Enbridge’s Northern Gateway project.

Never mind that the evidence doesn’t support either of these conspiracy theories, they are both widely believed in Alberta. (Note to readers who accuse me of carrying Mr. Trudeau’s water on this one: I still haven’t received my cheque!)

Line 3’s ambitious building schedule, after all, seems to have run afoul of the time it takes to get construction permits issued in the state of Minnesota. So presumably conservatives on this side of the 49th Parallel would have argued this is another failure of “social licence” – as opposed, one supposes, to a success of “the rule of law” – even if newly elected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had not been a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, as that state’s Democrats are quaintly known. (I didn’t make that up!)

What’s more, according to the Canadian Press account of yesterday’s Enbridge development, Mr. Walz, a former U.S. Senator, has asked his state’s Commerce Department to petition its Public Utility Commission to reconsider its approval of Line 3. His predecessor, two-term DFL governor Mark Dayton, tried the same thing, although without much success.

At the very least, Alberta conservatives can blame “foreign funded” environmentalists for this – even if they happen to be elected officials in, you know, a foreign country.

What’s more, Eugene McCarthy, the poet and prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, served Minnesota in the U.S. Senate from 1959 to 1971. Surely there’s a way for Trump-loving Alberta conservatives to blame Ms. Notley for that as well, and to add it to the reasons for their overwrought demands for Prime Minister Trudeau’s resignation. Liberals, ya know!

Nevertheless, one can be skeptical of the claims by Bloomberg News that a one-year delay in the Line 3 expansion is “a crushing setback for Canadian oil producers” while still recognizing the company’s announcement is a real political problem for the Canadian federal government and especially the Alberta NDP.

As an aside, fossil fuel extractors are not producers in the way farmers are producers of beef or barley, or even agricultural products like cheese that have undergone a chemical change, the make-believe language of the business pages notwithstanding.


Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers (Photo: Tony Evers Flickr, Creative Commons).

Meanwhile, the proud cheese producers of the state of Wisconsin on the other side of the clear waters of the St. Croix River had already approved their state’s section of Line 3 during the governorship of the notoriously anti-liberal Republican Scott Walker.

But now there’s a Democratic governor in that state too – which I’d bet if you asked Alberta conservatives is just one more thing to blame on their Canadian opponents.

No sooner was Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers sworn in on Jan. 7 than he was talking up a “liberal wish list” that includes funding Planned Parenthood and legalizing medical marijuana! So before you know it, Wisconsinites will probably be finishing their sentences with “eh?” – just as they already do in Minnesota, we are reliably informed.

The one thing most Albertans don’t understand that in order to balance the Alberta budget would need to close 50% of hospitals, schools and all other government Institutions, and those are the ones most Albertan’s complain about and want. I’m still waiting for Jason Kenney (JK) to explain how he will fix this and I don’t think he has a clue how to explain this to Albertans, and all he is doing is massaging the political truth for his own political gain. JK need to come forward and explain what measures he will use to balance the Alberta budget and I don’t think he has the intestinal fortitude or political will to do that, only using political lies to win for himself only.

“Conservatives have happily labelled a failure the Alberta NDP’s strategy of placating Canadian pipeline opposition with a combination of environmental measures designed to lower the province’s carbon footprint and a public influence campaign.”

Not just conservatives. Greens, environmentalists, scientists, energy economists, the OECD, anybody with a calculator.

• Under AB’s climate plan, AB’s grossly under-reported emissions will likely go UP, not down.
• Rising oilsands emissions offset reductions elsewhere and blow Canada’s targets out of the water for decades.
• AB’s climate plan sets no targets or timelines.
• Building fossil-fuel infrastructure locks us into a fossil-fuel future for decades.

The UN, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the federal Environment Commissioner all issued warnings in 2017 that Canada is NOT on track to meet its targets. The main obstacle? Rising oilsands emissions.
OECD: “Without a drastic decrease in the emissions intensity of the oilsands industry, the projected increase in oil production may seriously risk the achievement of Canada’s climate mitigation targets.”

Prof. Mark Jaccard, SFU: “National studies by independent researchers (including my university-based group) consistently show that Mr. Trudeau’s 2015 Paris promise of a 30% reduction by 2030 is unachievable with oilsands expansion.”

AB’s 100+ Mt oilsands emissions cap represents more than two thirds of Canada’s 2050 target (150 Mt). Add emissions from AB’s conventional oil and natural gas sectors, as well as AB’s population growth and urban sprawl. How could that possibly work?

Pipelines for a small carbon tax never made sense. Hopelessly contradictory policy.
Buying (or assuming) social license for pipelines in one province with a small carbon tax in another? Absurd.

The aim of AB’s Climate Plan was to “roughly stabilize emissions, by 2030, just above current levels”, not reduce them.
“Many will look at these emissions reductions and claim that our policies will not place AB on a trajectory consistent with global 2o C goals, and in some sense this is true – the policies proposed for Alberta in this document would not, if applied in all jurisdictions in the world, lead to global goals being accomplished.”

• http://www.alberta.ca/documents/climate/climate-leadership-report-to-minister.pdf

Notley and Trudeau are betting that the world will fail to take real action on climate change. That is the only scenario in which oilsands expansion makes sense.

This article should make NDP supporters angry.
I frequently confront UCP zealots and climate change deniers: “Do facts matter?” Increasingly, the question is coming up on the left.

Notley is a scam-artist. The sooner we dump faux-progressive politicians, the sooner we can return to sanity, science-based policy, and traditional NDP values.

I think politics at times certainly focus on the wrong issues. I certainly agree David that the UCP will try to make hay on this issue. I think the bigger picture is more important. In the final quarter of 2018 according to Statscan Canada’s economic growth basically flatlined. There is an interesting article on the CBC news site by Trevor Tombe titled: “December earnings in Alberta show slight decline from previous year:Statscan.” From this article “Statscan numbers show total amount of compensation-earnings as well as benefits like Employment insurance contributions and health coverage-that Alberta workers collected in December fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier, from $13.42 billion in December 2017 to $13.38 billion in December 2018.” There is in my opinion a connection between the ability to get export pipelines built and the lacklustre economic performance of late. For Premier Notley entering an election period with a slowing economy and very little good news on the pipeline front certainly doesn’t bode well. I do agree there was nothing that an Alberta Premier could do to change what has occurred with Enbridge’s line 3 but in the political realm that won’t matter. Enjoy your day.

Canadian growth may have flatlined recently, supposedly due to pipeline delays – that seems to be the favorite Conservative talking point of the week. It sounds sort of serious or ominous, but it doesn’t take much to show how hollow this is.
Remember back in 2015 when the Conservatives were in power, growth didn’t just flat line, it was in the red – the economy was declining! Interestingly, the decline ended right after the Harper Conservatives were replaced and until recently growth has been surprisingly strong under the Liberals.

I find the long standing American parody line – Blame Canada a bit amusing. However the Conservatives seem to have adopted blame Trudeau as a serious argument and have over relied on it to the point of them risking becoming the joke. Yes, I have no doubt they will somehow try to tie Trudeau and perhaps Premier Notley also to the latest pipeline delay in Minnesota. However, if anything this delay should serve to show us that the difficulty in getting controversial pipeline projects approved is not just a problem unique to Canada.

Of course the Conservatives will totally miss that important point and just continue to natter on in an overwraught way about Trudeau being the cause of all our problems.

No sooner had former justice minister Jody Wilson-Reybould completed her startling testimony last Wednesday before the House of Commons Justice Committee – replete with detailed allegations of political interference in the justice system by Justin Trudeau and other senior Liberals – than the Conservatives were going full-throttle after the prime minister.

He must resign, Mr. Scheer insisted, a sentiment immediately echoed by his caucus and their many friends in media.

This was, of course, predictable and overwrought. Reasonable people – at least those not in the throes of fanatical Trudeau hatred typical of Mr. Scheer’s retreaded Rebel Media strategic brain trust – are likely to see this demand as too much, too soon.

Instead of pulling the fire alarm, newly elected NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh urged a public inquiry. “Jagmeet and his advisers were smart because they’ve now got a vehicle in which they can keep dropping evidence to argue for a public inquiry step by step,” NDP strategist turned high-zoot lobbyist Robin Sears told the Toronto Star.


Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andrew Scheer Flickr Account, Wikimedia Commons).

What are the Conservatives going to ask for now that they’ve demanded the PM step down in a fit of hysteria, Mr. Sears wondered. “Jump off a cliff?”

At least the NDP strategy – let’s wait and see, and ratchet up the pressure as we move along – is likely to resonate with voters who actually think about the real implications for the rule of law in a country that continually and sanctimoniously advises the world that’s what matters most around here.

That, of course, does not describe every voter. But what if sufficient numbers of Mr. Trudeau’s supporters just don’t care?

This may be a reality the Canadian Conservatives enthusiastically helped to create and now are forced to confront.

To a greater extent than at any point in recent history, voters in Canada, and other Western democracies, live in silos. If they pay any attention at all to what people they disagree with are saying, it’s only to trade angry memes on social media, dismiss unfavourable reports as “fake news,” and shout abuse.


NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Do potential Trudeau voters even care if he interfered with the Canadian justice system? I’m not talking about his core supporters, but the larger universe of voters needed to tilt an election. How many voters think pushing Ms. Wilson-Reybould to protect Canadian jobs was the right thing to do regardless of the murky rules? How many thought, “So what?” We don’t know the answers to these questions.

Naturally, whatever Mr. Trudeau did, and we don’t really have a clear picture yet, drives the Conservative base crazy. But, remember, these are people who simply hate Mr. Trudeau. This is a group, indeed, that was almost driven over the edge by the fact Mr. Trudeau used to be a drama teacher!

Never mind there’s a range of possible credible interpretations of Mr. Trudeau’s actions, from prudent leadership all the way to outright corruption. Is it possible sufficient numbers of Canadian voters think what the PM did was reasonable, and don’t really give a hoot about the implications, if any? I’d say yes.


Lobbyist and former NDP strategist Robin Sears (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Consider Donald Trump, president of the United States, pilloried daily by the New York Times and the Washington Post. Yes, his popularity is down to about where you might expect it to be in a U.S. president’s first term, but the Republican base and the party’s legislators are unshaken in their determination to stand by their man. His approval rate is higher today than Ronald Reagan’s was at this point in his first term.

No need to go south of the border to observe this phenomenon. How much did Canadian voters care about the sins of Stephen Harper, the man who pulls Mr. Scheer’s strings? No very much, if his electoral record is anything to go by.

Found in contempt of Parliament? Didn’t matter. Prorogued Parliament to avoid a no-confidence vote? Didn’t matter.


Former Conservative MP and cabinet minister Tony Clement (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Deliberately falsifying documents? Misleading Parliament? Giving ministerial staffers immunity from testifying before Parliamentary committees? Turning Question Period into a Vaudeville show? Defaming the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when she wouldn’t do what he wanted? Tolerating corrupt cronies? Requiring public employees to swear loyalty oaths? Using federal civil servants as stooges for partisan purposes? Destroying science libraries and burning their books? Borrowing money without Parliament’s permission? Ignoring their own fixed-election-date law when it was inconvenient? Using G8 security funds to build gazebos for Tony Clement’s riding? Exceeding election spending limits in the in-and-out scandal?

There’s much more, but readers get the picture. None of these things harmed the Conservatives’ re-election chances during Mr. Harper’s decade in power.

Paying off Mike Duffy, sending non-Con voters to the wrong polling station with robo-call dirty tricks, and using Revenue Canada to attack charities that opposed his energy policies might have hurt a little. Then again, Canadians may have tired of Mr. Harper for completely different reasons – too long in the tooth, didn’t wear colourful socks, hated his haircut, whatever.

None of this bothered his core supporters, and didn’t bother a lot of other voters very much either.

Mr. Trump appears to be coated in Teflon. For a long time Mr. Harper was too. Why not Mr. Trudeau?

Seriously, what makes anyone think voters will react to Mr. Trudeau’s alleged transgressions much differently that they did to Mr. Harper’s?

It’s not as if they who are without sin are casting the first stones! Many voters, in fact, will take the record of Mr. Scheer’s party into account when they cast their ballots.

Perhaps this is to Mr. Singh’s advantage, if he can turn around his recent image as a bumbler. Perhaps it will work out to Mr. Scheer’s, his party’s horrible record notwithstanding.

But no one should assume on the basis of Postmedia’s coverage of the SNC-Lavalin Affair that Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal Government are done for, any more than anyone should reach the conclusion Mr. Trump is finished just because of something they read in the New York Times of the Washington Post","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">What are the Conservatives going to ask for now that they’ve demanded the PM step down in a fit of hysteria, Mr. Sears wondered. “Jump off a cliff?”</p>
<p class=""p1"">At least the NDP strategy – let’s wait and see, and ratchet up the pressure as we move along – is likely to resonate with voters who actually think about the real implications for the rule of law in a country that continually and sanctimoniously advises the world that’s what matters most around here.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That, of course, does not describe every voter. But what if sufficient numbers of Mr. Trudeau’s supporters <i>just don’t care?</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">This may be a reality the Canadian Conservatives enthusiastically helped to create and now are forced to confront.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To a greater extent than at any point in recent history, voters in Canada, and other Western democracies, live in silos. If they pay any attention at all to what people they disagree with are saying, it’s only to trade angry memes on social media, dismiss unfavourable reports as “fake news,” and shout abuse.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Do potential Trudeau voters even care if he interfered with the Canadian justice system? I’m not talking about his core supporters, but the larger universe of voters needed to tilt an election. How many voters think pushing Ms. Wilson-Reybould to protect Canadian jobs was the right thing to do regardless of the murky rules? How many thought, <i>“So what?”</i> We don’t know the answers to these questions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Naturally, whatever Mr. Trudeau did, and we don’t really have a clear picture yet, drives the Conservative base crazy. But, remember, these are people who simply hate Mr. Trudeau. This is a group, indeed, that was almost driven over the edge by the fact <i>Mr. Trudeau used to be a drama teacher!</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Never mind there’s a range of possible credible interpretations of Mr. Trudeau’s actions, from prudent leadership all the way to outright corruption. Is it possible sufficient numbers of Canadian voters think what the PM did was reasonable, and don’t really give a hoot about the implications, if any? I’d say yes.</p>

It’s becoming very cult like Conservatives here in Canada seem to be suffering from Trudeau derangement syndrome, similar to Trump derangement syndrome south of the border.
Let’s not forget these bribes were paid to officials of a government Harper supported the destruction of. I wonder what happened to the 160 million? It would be interesting to trace who’s hands it ultimately ended up it, surely it wasn’t all spent prior to Obama and Clinton’s adventures.

The SNC Lavalin thing reminds me a bit of Elbowgate, the much overwrought incident earlier in Trudeau’s term that many pundits and partisans were hyperventalating about at the time. I think ordinary people got that Trudeau made a mistake, but it wasn’t a big deal because really it had so little relevance in their own lives. In the same way all the recent pundit talk about the Sharcross Doctrine that nobody has heard of before and even the civil servants in the Privy Council didn’t seem to pay much attention to is just more inside the beltway politics. It has nothing to do with the price of canola in New Sarepta.

Yes, there are troubling aspects of this situation
particularily for some Liberal supporters, but it would be a mistake to think they are now going to embrace Scheer and the Conservatives. Less partisan, less engaged voters are even less likely to care about the arcane arguments and issues involved here. In fact, they may see Trudeau as standing up to preserve jobs as not such a bad thing, just as American voters did not necesarily see America first or Trump’s tarriff threats as a bad thing, even though economists, pundits and elite expert hyperventalated about that.

On the pipeline issue Conservatives have criticized Trudeau for quite a while now for not interfering with the rule of law, arguing economic concerns should trump legal process. Now in SNC Lavalin they seem to be arguing the opposite. They may think the voters have missed the hypocricy in this, but I suspect some have caught it, especially in Quebec. I think it may come across there as western jobs very important to the Conservatives, Quebec ones not so much. Of course every party better represents those that vote for it, more than those that do not.

However, while we may be disappointed Mr. Trudeau is not perfect, I don’t think Mr. Scheer has or will convince many voters that he and his party are the second incarnation of Mother Teresa. The past Conservative record was not so great and they don’t seem to have learned or forgot much since then. As an election nears they seem to be veering back towards the overly partisan sniping and excessive attacks that voters found a somewhat offputting in the Harper years.

Jeff: don’t be so ungrateful. Trudeau actually bought you a pipeline and it only cost one year’s worth of prairie wheat and barley exports. Notley is even buying locomotives and oil cars to help out. And now little Kenney is promising to lower corporate taxes from tiny to microscopic. How much welfare can the oil sector take?

When you say ‘Harper’s “scandals” [that] were torqued up non events,” surely you’re referring to charges of breaking election campaign-funding laws that were laid against the Conservative party, aren’t you?

And when you call the court of law in which the Crown prosecuted the party for these offences “an establishment that hated his very existence,” you’re probably referring to the existence of evidence which proved the offence had been committed, not to Harper himself, and perhaps overstating just a tad the court’s disapproval of anyone breaking the law as hatred.

I know a lot of people really hated how it cost tax dollars to prosecute the party in court. Can’t really call these “non events” seeing how the defendant was convicted (Harper preferred to call it a “disagreement”) and fined—I can’t remember right now if it was the fine was six-figures or the court costs for the defence that was seven-figures, or vise versa, but the total public cost could have been eight-figures.

So, JT’s scandal “is legitimate,” is it? I also have to disagree it’s a catastrophe.

With Postmedia columnists it is very much a case of crying wolf. I barely even look at the National Post section of The Journal that my wife’s mother passes on to us. For years it has been a relentless series of negative headlines. I thik if Justin Trudeau discovered a cure for cancer the PM headline would be “Justin Trudeau Works to Produce Doctor Unemployment”.

This brings back to mind the Tommy Douglas poltical fable, “Mouseland,” which “expresses the CCF’s view that the Canadian political system was flawed in offering the voters a false dichotomy: the choice of two parties, neither of which represented their interests.” Perhaps, not much has changed, i.e.the Liberals and the Conservatives, the white cats and the black cats, all cats, not good for us mice because either one is still a bunch of cats.
Agreed, Singh’s NDP has come across with a much more reasoned approach to the SNC-Lavalin Scandal than the Conservatives. Unfortunately for Scheer, he doesn’t seem to be up to snuff. It would be galling though to think that the arrogant Trudeau would win again, but, hopefully not with a majority. It has been heartwarming, indeed, to watch him be outmaneuvered brilliantly by Jody Wilson-Raybould.
These recent majority governments, both Tory and Grit, have sure revealed their true scandal-ridden colours. I will do my part and not vote for either of them.
These scandals, also bring to mind, again, having a form of proportional representation with our elections. It is a more fair reflection of the actual vote and it could provide better checks and balances with regard to this bad, entitled, scandal-ridden majority government behavior, with impunity. It has gotten so bad, it begs the question re: the Liberals and the Conservatives, “Who the hell do they think they are?”

Yes, in a democracy, like ours, the real question should be, “How will voters react?”
But in the here and now, the question actually is how will the media react? The MSM, a corporatist group not notably different that say, CAPP, except perhaps for their literacy, are spitting all over themselves in an attempt to spin an extremely difficult legal and political decision making process. It certainly doesn’t help that an honest-to-gawd FN princess is having fainting spells and emotional outrage while participating in these highest level discussions. It’s all very good copy – for a gossip rag!
As for serious news and journalism again, I think you are in the vanguard David with this piece.

Justin was always a lightweight, and this affair makes him look inept, at best. I’d much sooner see Chrysta Freeland at the helm. However, I don’t think much of any of the opposition parties or their leaders. Justin’s big problem this fall may be an “enthusiasm gap” like the one that afflicted Hilary.

There’s a saying in Canadian politics that “Oppositions don’t win elections, governments lose elections.” That should worry those of us who really don’t want Scheer as PM. But a minority government of centre-left parties might be a tolerable outcome.

Yes, but you never did vote Liberal, did you? Not voting for JT isn’t going to make much difference to him or you.

I don’t blame you for disagreeing with Scheer: after endorsing the neo-nazi-infested truckers’ rally almost nothing he can say could be so dumb—but ramping-up the rhetoric over Jody-and-JT to level ten (when there is no level eleven to go to) could almost qualify: he now has to do the Chicken Little for the next eight months or ‘walk it back,’ as they say—‘cept it’ll look more like Andrew falling on his ass.

True, though: Scheer really does need something to make JT easier to beat, although it doesn’t look like he has anything like that handy himself—which is why he seized so rashly upon what most Canadians see as a politcal misdemeanour, at worst.

If it’s a battle of ethics, Scheer’s gonna have a hard time trying to compare favourably with any of the other leaders.

As for Philpot’s resignation, I suspect she’s trying to pre-empt something she knows will inevitably out: that she egged Jody on when the stressed Justice Minister sought her consolence —and that, in the fullness of inquiry, will become apparent. She may end up being blamed for leading the rookie minster astray. Her move definitely looks distractive, the only question being of what. At present we do know the two were fairly tight and, this episode having taken a few months to unfold during which time Jody claims to have been increasingly beset by PMO bullies, it seems likely she would have confided in her friend and cabinet colleague. Everybody wants to know—because there are still so many unanswered questions—what else is not being divulged. I’ll bet Philpot and Jody know.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, lately rebranded The Policy Guy ™, has promised a massive cut in business taxes to create jobs.


United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, The Policy Guy ™ (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In Calgary yesterday, Mr. Kenney vowed to slash the lowest business taxes in the country by a third, from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. He claimed this will create 50,000 jobs.

Needless to say, his obedient UCP troops were in a rapturous state, as are the usual suspects in mainstream media. A total of 50 per cent of Alberta’s academic economists who regularly hold forth on social media on such topics also supported the would-be premier’s policy pronouncement as a good idea. The other one disagreed.


Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Well, I’m no economist, but I read some, and it can be pretty confidently predicted that no jobs will be created by such a policy, although there will certainly be some very happy corporate shareholders who are able to buy new and more elaborate condos in Palm Springs or wherever Alberta’s wealthy classes winter nowadays.

It can also be predicted with equal confidence that if Mr. Kenney had plans to cut the crap out of your kids’ education and your own health care, he’s going to end up having to cut out even more after the dust settles from this.

Don’t forget, Mr. Kenney has also promised to drop the Carbon Levy, so that’s another $3 billion we’ll still have to pay in taxes, except that now they’ll be taxes to Ottawa instead of an account the Government of Alberta can access. Plus he’s going to balance the budget. Right.


Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman (Photo: Flickr account of Alan C., Taekwonweirdo, Creative Commons).

As economist Paul Krugman pointed out in a recent New York Times column about the claims made by the U.S. Republican Party about the supposed benefits of big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy (which are the same as Mr. Kenney’s ideas, presumably because that’s where he gets them), they rest “on research by … well, nobody. There isn’t any body of serious work supporting GOP tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.”

Dr. Krugman asked: “Why do Republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data?” He answered: “Well, ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich, and it’s obvious.”

It’s no different on this side of the imaginary line between our two countries, obviously.

It’s not just Dr. Krugman, of course. The Alberta Federation of Labour this morning quickly dug up some 75 articles that say the same thing – which isn’t surprising, of course, because as the winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics pointed out, it’s the prevailing view among professional economists. I imagine by now the AFL has found 75 or 100 more.


The late Ralph Klein, premier of Alberta (Photo: Chuck Szmurlo, Creative Commons).

Not only is it not working in the United States under Donald Trump, but at the state level it’s failed in Kansas, in Oklahoma, in Arizona, and in Kentucky. Oh, and it failed in Saskatchewan – although, at least there, then-premier Brad Wall partly reversed course when he realized it was failing. Maybe that’s why he was the “real leader of Western Canada,” as someone used to say.

It flopped in Australia, too, just as it will fail disastrously in Alberta. Or not, depending on how you measure success. Because as this Guardian article about the Australia’s massive tax cuts explains, it’s not just a transfer of wealth to the rich from the rest of us, it’s a scam to grease the skids for even bigger transfers.

“Australia isn’t poor; it is rich beyond the imagining of anyone living in the 1970s or 80s,” wrote author Richard Denniss in the Guardian. “But so much of that new wealth has been vacuumed up by a few, and so little of that new wealth has been paid in tax, that the public has been convinced that ours is a country struggling to pay its bills.”

“Convincing Australians that our nation is poor and that our governments ‘can’t afford’ to provide the level of services they provided in the past has not just helped to lower our expectations of our public services and infrastructure, it has helped to lower our expectations of democracy itself,” Mr. Denniss continued.

This will sound very familiar to anyone who has lived in Alberta for a while. All you have to do is replace Australia with Alberta, and you have succinctly told the story of our province as long as many of us can remember, at least since Ralph Klein became premier in 1992.

It’s a con. It’s always a disaster. And it ended to a significant degree in 2015 with the election of Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP.

Mr. Kenney intends to send us right back to where we were, the richest place on earth, which we’re perpetually told is the poorest place on earth. Only this time, there will be no plan for a future that’s changing, quickly, beyond stomping our feet and blaming others for our troubles.

We’re not going to stimulate the economy by firing nurses and teachers, which is the only way Mr. Kenney’s “job creation” scheme will end. Face it, there can only be so many private hernia clinics and religious private schools teaching creation science to young citizens of a flat earth.

If we fall for this snake oil, we’re going to have to swallow it.

Green Party calls for a sales tax


Green Party of Alberta Finance Critic Carl Svoboda (Photo: Green Party of Alberta).

It’s easy to be brave when your chances of being elected are minimal. Still, hats off to the Green Party of Alberta for speaking the unpalatable truth.

The Greens say they want a sales tax implemented “as a means of establishing predictability to budget planning in a time when the price of oil is in free-fall on the world market.”

“The move would generate revenue needed to maintain essential social services in the face of irresponsible cuts suggested by the UCP,” the party said in a news release Sunday.

“The other parties are terrified to mention a sales tax other than to denounce it, but the Green Party is not,” said Carl Svoboda, the party’s finance critic and its candidate in the Calgary-Edgemont riding. “It is time for Alberta to start acting like a normal province.”

Never mind the rules, Stephen Mandel may run, a court decides


Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If you grew up firm in the belief “ignorance of the law is no excuse,” you might want to reconsider that quaint notion in light of the court ruling Stephen Mandel may run for public office after all, despite having ignored Alberta’s election financing legislation by not filing his paperwork on time.

After all, Madame Justice Gaylene Kendell’s written decision yesterday concluded that the law shouldn’t be applied to the Alberta Party leader, a former Conservative cabinet minister and mayor of Edmonton, because he was acting in good faith when he broke it.

Due to the unquestionably unreasonable severity of the penalty Mr. Mandel faced – a two-election ban from running merely for having missed some paperwork – the Court of Queen’s Bench Justice’s decision may in fact be just. But it says more about the value of good connections and access to the services of an imaginative barrister than about the rule of law, of which we hear so much nowadays.

Don’t expect this principle to be applied by the courts in favour of other citizens who run afoul of harsh or unreasonable laws.

There is a good chance this ruling would be overturned if it were appealed, as it should be. An appeal, though, seems unlikely for reasons that have less to do with the law and more to do with politics. Pity","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">
  <p class=""p1"">Oh for crying out loud! The tax cut fairy has returned to Alberta! She’s brought snake oil!</p>
<p class=""p1"">United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, lately rebranded The Policy Guy ™, has promised a massive cut in business taxes to create jobs.</p>

Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">In Calgary yesterday, Mr. Kenney vowed to slash the lowest business taxes in the country by a third, from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. He claimed this will create 50,000 jobs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Needless to say, his obedient UCP troops were in a rapturous state, as are the usual suspects in mainstream media. A total of 50 per cent of Alberta’s academic economists who regularly hold forth on social media on such topics also supported the would-be premier’s policy pronouncement as a good idea. The other one disagreed.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Well, I’m no economist, but I read some, and it can be pretty confidently predicted that no jobs will be created by such a policy, although there will certainly be some very happy corporate shareholders who are able to buy new and more elaborate condos in Palm Springs or wherever Alberta’s wealthy classes winter nowadays.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It can also be predicted with equal confidence that if Mr. Kenney had plans to cut the crap out of your kids’ education and your own health care, he’s going to end up having to cut out even more after the dust settles from this.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Don’t forget, Mr. Kenney has also promised to drop the Carbon Levy, so that’s another $3 billion we’ll still have to pay in taxes, except that now they’ll be taxes to Ottawa instead of an account the Government of Alberta can access. Plus he’s going to balance the budget. <i>Right.</i></p>

There isn’t any body of serious work supporting GOP tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Dr. Krugman asked: “Why do Republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data?” He answered: “Well, ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich, and it’s obvious.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s no different on this side of the imaginary line between our two countries, obviously.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s not just Dr. Krugman, of course. The Alberta Federation of Labour this morning quickly dug up some 75 articles that say the same thing – which isn’t surprising, of course, because as the winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics pointed out, it’s the prevailing view among professional economists. I imagine by now the AFL has found 75 or 100 more.</p>

Or not, depending on how you measure success.

<p class=""p1"">“Australia isn’t poor; it is rich beyond the imagining of anyone living in the 1970s or 80s,” wrote author Richard Denniss in the Guardian. “But so much of that new wealth has been vacuumed up by a few, and so little of that new wealth has been paid in tax, that the public has been convinced that ours is a country struggling to pay its bills.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Convincing Australians that our nation is poor and that our governments ‘can’t afford’ to provide the level of services they provided in the past has not just helped to lower our expectations of our public services and infrastructure, it has helped to lower our expectations of democracy itself,” Mr. Denniss continued.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This will sound very familiar to anyone who has lived in Alberta for a while. All you have to do is replace <i>Australia</i> with <i>Alberta</i>, and you have succinctly told the story of our province as long as many of us can remember, at least since Ralph Klein became premier in 1992.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s a con. It’s always a disaster. And it ended to a significant degree in 2015 with the election of Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Kenney intends to send us right back to where we were, the richest place on earth, which we’re perpetually told is the poorest place on earth. Only this time, there will be no plan for a future that’s changing, quickly, beyond stomping our feet and blaming others for our troubles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We’re not going to stimulate the economy by firing nurses and teachers, which is the only way Mr. Kenney’s “job creation” scheme will end.

The fairy tale goes something like this – the handsome and charming Prince Kenney lowered taxes for large corporations and everyone lived happily ever after. However, there is no Cinderella in this story and the only ones who will be happy are the large corporations and their shareholders as they gleefully go to the bank.

Snake oil salemen always seem to prey on the unfortunate and desperate, as they promise a dubious miracle cure. As in most cases, the real problem is as obvious as the nose on our faces even if some can’t or don’t want to see it. Oil prices are less than half their peak and natural gas prices less than a quarter. Even when corporate taxes were lower under the PC’s, Alberta had some years when the economy did well and others when it did poorly. Generally this was correlated with the price of oil and natural gas at the time, not corporate tax rates, which they did not change much.

However, reducing corporate tax rates will increase the deficit and that would help Kenney to manufacture a financial crisis he would use to justify breaking his promise not to make major service cuts to education and health care. I suppose his fairy tale does not have a happy ending for everyone, but I am getting ahead of myself here. We are not supposed to figure that out until after it is too late.

I don’t know how the hell JK expects to pay to build new schools, hospitals, and roads, or to operate and maintain the ones we already have, while at the same time choking off the government’s sources of revenue needed to pay for it. Maybe unicorns and fairy dust… Then there’s the whole thing about fixing “rural crime”, which requires investment in policing, the courts, and the correctional system, investment paid for out of—wait for it—taxes (I’m not going to include dealing with root causes of crime, like addictions, mental health challenges and poverty, because so-con nutters like JK don’t believe in any of it). What’s he going to tell his base when his tax cuts lead to closure of rural RCMP detachments?

In his announcement, Jason Kenney argued that a lower corporate tax rate would lure businesses here from other provinces, and prosperity would abound. That may sound wonderful, until you think about the next step: other provinces will then feel pressure to lower their corporate tax rate as well, to prevent their corporations from leaving, and we will have a race to the bottom. If the other provinces do lower their corporate tax rate, we will not gain a competitive advantage, just less revenue to reduce the deficit with.

I happen to agree that a cut in corporate income tax from 12% to 8% is a bit extreme. I would say 12% to 10% over 4 years would be more realistic. For those that say it will reduce revenue let’s compare the third quarter update from 2014-2015 with a corporate tax of 10% to the third quarter update from 2018-2019 with a 12% corporate tax rate. In 2014-2015 the updated projection for corporate tax revenue was $5.495 billion( by the end of the third quarter they had already recieved over $4.2 billion). Move ahead to 2018-2019 and corporate tax revenue is projected to be $4.1 billion, $463 million less than projected in the budget. Now there is no doubt that the economy was doing better in 2014-2015 but one thing has been very consistent since the NDP raised the corporate tax rate and that is that revenue has never met projections! Enjoy your day.

Farmer Brown, you can’t compare 2014 to 2018. If we had a 12% corporate tax rate in 2014, we would have had significantly more revenue then. The difference in oil price is vast and is driving this. If the corporate tax rate were now 10%, our revenues would have been lower yet.

Another Climenhaga potpourri of useful information and enlightenment — well-argued and well-researched pushback on Kenney’s proposed tax cuts. Well done!

It appears Jason Kenney is taking us down the Donald J. Trump rabbit-hole with his flurry of recent election pronouncements, to wit:• Tax cuts for the rich
• Massive deregulation
• Healthcare cuts (frozen funding)
• Minimum wage cuts
• Tax cuts for big business
• More Charter schools
• Dictatorial leadership
• Dog-whistle politics
• Unbridled gaslighting

Who knew Kenney’s brave new world would be so Trumpian — Devin (MAGA) Dreeshen notwithstanding?

Gail, I think we are all ideologues to some extent. I like to back my ideas up with numbers. I did a bit more digging on actual and projected revenue from corporate and personal income tax in Alberta. With a little looking I found that for the 2014-2015 budget year the revenue from a corporate income tax of 10% was $5.796 billion. Now if we move ahead to the actual numbers for 2017-2018 at a 12% corporate tax rate we see revenue of $3.448 billion. Then of course we have the recent projection by the NDP government for 2018-2019 of $4.1 billion at the 12% corporate tax rate. The raising of the rate so far has shown no improvement of revenues but certainly shows how connected revenues are to economic health. Personal tax revenues show interesting results as well. The actual number for 2014-2015 was $11.042 billion, I believe at the time we still had the 10% rate straight through but I can certainly be corrected on that. Move ahead to the actual numbers for 2017-2018, the actual number is $10.775 billion, remember we now have the NDP progressive income tax topping out at 15%. Projections for 2018-2019 are for personal tax revenues of $12.137 billion, certainly an improvement over the previous year. Income tax revenues certainly fluctuate widely year to year and there appears to be little improvement from raising the rates. The strength of the economy appears to have a greater influence, as well as the price of a barrel of oil. Enjoy your day

Wait a second I thought Imperial Oil economist Mintz said a one percent corporate tax increase would cause 9,000 lost jobs. A favorite talking point during the last election by the PC and the Wildrose party. So a 4% cut provides 50,000 new jobs?
They really need to show their work on these numbers and if the name Mintz comes up again it is safe to call BS.

RE: Kenney Proposed Tax Cuts

Kenney has never learned lessons about corporate tax cuts. As we know from past tax cuts in Canada under Liberal and Conservative Governments, the corporations just bank the money rather than re-investing it as a collective whole. They just collectively sit on the cash rather than re-investing.

To reduce corporate tax rates when Alberta has near the lowest corporate taxes in North America is pretty much just going to stimulate a continental race to the bottom for corporate tax cuts. There are many Conservatives that want to eliminate corporate income taxes. Kenney is pushing that way which will lead to more poverty in Alberta and more environmental destruction which will lead to more health problems.

Re: Green Party of Alberta push for Sales Tax in Alberta

Any proposed highly regressive sales tax, which will harm the poor and struggling businesses, should be put to a referendum in Alberta. Albertans need democratic control as to how the government picks the pockets of the people. There are multiple ways to generate revenues for the government other than having a regressive sales tax. One of these ways includes non tax revenue generation as well.

The Green Party of Alberta (GPA) has a constitutionally entrenched Article (3.1c) where the party is suppose to support Participatory Democracy. It is failing to do so however, particularly in the case of wanting to autocratically impose a sales tax without first consulting the people on alternatives. The party is showing it is as undemocratic as all other parties in Alberta and the current party executive is not following the GPA constitution to prevent such undemocratic and anti-constitutional behaviors. This is harming the Greens chances of electing a MLA while maintaining a political group think mentality which does not create an environment for out of the box thinking when it comes to “fixing” Alberta’s debt problems that were created by the Conservatives and NDP. Alberta needs real participatory democracy, where people make the decisions rather than politicians, in order to truly unleash the Alberta Advantage.

RE: Alberta Party Leader Mandel Getting Off Breaking Election Rules

We have too much interference in laws not being enforced in Canada and the Mandel along with the SNC Lavalin scandals are just the tip of the ice berg. Numerous politicians in the past have faced election law breaking penalties like Alberta Party Leader Mandel, yet in this case the Alberta court system decided to let Mandel off unfairly. If this was Venezuela, there would be a constitutional crisis. This should be a wake up call to all Canadians that those who break laws are not being held accountable due to “interference”.

If the SNC Lavalin scandal did not involve a Justice Minister resigning, none of us would be aware of what is going on in our justice and political system. Now I know why all sorts of corporations, like VW who broke emission standards laws in Canada, do not get charged and the people instead pay for their crimes. All sorts of companies and people are not receiving the punishment they deserve when they break the laws of this country and it is time for this nonsense to stop otherwise the corruption will just get deeper and our society will just go further down the toilet from hell. What is occurring is poor leadership by example and this sends a message to kids that you can likely break the law if you have a white collar and not get charged.

To avoid such interference in those doing crime without doing the time, maybe courts should use Artificial Intelligence like IBM Watson to determine sentences to prevent judges from willy nilly enforcing laws- depending on their mood or bribes received. IBM Watson could be loaded up with all sorts of laws and precedents and spit out sentences faster than a judge could wack a gavel. Through a process of real participatory democracy, the people should decide whether IBM Watson or some other system assists in our court system to ensuring equality in our justice system.

It is time for “smart” courts of justice.

Make way for real democracy.

James you talk of a highly regressive sales tax. I did some quick research and looked at what some consider to be very successful social democracies, Norway and Finland. Norway had a corporate tax rate of 50% in 1982. Today they have a corporate tax rate of 24%. Today they have a VAT(sales tax) rate of 25%. Finland’s rates are very similar. Their 2019 corporate tax rate is 20%. They have a VAT of 24%. These countries have well funded social and education systems. My personal opinion is it is the citizens that benefit the most from well funded social and education systems and they should foot the bill through their taxes. The revenue from a sales tax provides a more dependable revenue stream than income taxes because how strong a countries economy is has a larger influence on income and therefore income taxes than on how much consumers spend which influence sales tax revenue. Albertan’s fail to realize that our refusal to accept a sales tax is really just hurting ourselves. Enjoy your day.

Keep in mind that the government of Norway takes about an 80% equity share in all oil and gas plays and they do have a very generous cradle to grave welfare state.

In my view it is actually corporations who benefit the most from a good welfare state. Their shareholders do not need to pay workers’ medical costs, they have access to an educated and healthy work force, prosperous customers, and of course they don’t have to worry very much about the angry poor murdering them. I think it is just so much better to live in an open community without the need for gun toting guards, don’t you?

BTW, if you account for technological productivity grains, the corporate tax rate should be closer to its 1950s level of 80%.

246,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"Liberals could have helped themselves and helped Canadians by going for full national pharmacare now, but … nope",2019-03-07 00:35:00,David Climenhaga,,"When Canadians heard Monday there was to be a big announcement on pharmacare yesterday, many of us concluded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s shell-shocked strategic brain trust was finally ready to start acting like a Natural Governing Party again, instead of like lemmings racing for a cliff.

It would have been a brilliant strategy to announce a full pharmacare program – the full-meal deal with no bones tossed to Big Pharma or Big Insurance, which have been begging for a fill-in-the-gaps approach that would keep their expensive and unfair but highly profitable stopgaps in place.


A lemming (Photo: Wikipedia).

It would have shifted the nation’s attention immediately away from the hostile media frenzy the protracted gong show before the House of Commons Justice Committee has become and turned it toward a popular and much needed national program on which a party and a prime minister could easily peg a successful re-election campaign.

It would have reminded voters that for all their flaws the Liberals were still basically a progressive political party willing occasionally to do things that are actually in the interests of Canadians, such as creating a national prescription drug plan that would save lives, ensure no one had to choose between life-saving medicine or feeding their kids, and stop the waste of multi-billions of tax dollars to boot.

It would have forced the Conservatives led by the increasingly screechy Andrew Scheer and in thrall to their cruel utopian market ideology to attack a program that plainly would benefit every single one of us unless we happened to be a Big Pharma or Big Insurance executive. Yes, even screwball market perfectionists would benefit if they had the misfortune to get sick and needed to set aside their nutty ideological pipe dreams to survive.

Instead, we got … recommendations.

Which means, of course, more time for Big Business, their ideological think tanks and the Conservatives to cook up ways to sabotage this still unrealized national good.

Progressive groups did their best with the interim report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, which recommended creation of a national pharmaceutical drug agency, a comprehensive evidence-based formulary, and suggested core principles for national pharmacare. Several good-hearted organizations put out news releases calling the development “promising.”

But Canadians don’t need promises. They need pharmacare. And they need it now.

And so do the Liberals, oddly enough. Desperately so, right now, one would think.

But I guess the party of Justin Trudeau has discovered, as the old stories go, that once you’ve sold your soul, it’s very hard to get it back.

  <p class=""p1"">When Canadians heard Monday there was to be a big announcement on pharmacare yesterday, many of us concluded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s shell-shocked strategic brain trust was finally ready to start acting like a Natural Governing Party again, instead of like lemmings racing for a cliff.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It would have been a brilliant strategy to announce a full pharmacare program – the full-meal deal with no bones tossed to Big Pharma or Big Insurance, which have been begging for a fill-in-the-gaps approach that would keep their expensive and unfair but highly profitable stopgaps in place.</p>

<p class=""p1"">It would have shifted the nation’s attention immediately away from the hostile media frenzy the protracted gong show before the House of Commons Justice Committee has become and turned it toward a popular and much needed national program on which a party and a prime minister could easily peg a successful re-election campaign.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It would have reminded voters that for all their flaws the Liberals were still basically a progressive political party willing occasionally to do things that are actually in the interests of Canadians, such as creating a national prescription drug plan that would save lives, ensure no one had to choose between life-saving medicine or feeding their kids, and stop the waste of multi-billions of tax dollars to boot.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It would have forced the Conservatives led by the increasingly screechy Andrew Scheer and in thrall to their cruel utopian market ideology to attack a program that plainly would benefit every single one of us unless we happened to be a Big Pharma or Big Insurance executive. Yes, even screwball market perfectionists would benefit if they had the misfortune to get sick and needed to set aside their nutty ideological pipe dreams to survive.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Instead, we got … <i>recommendations</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Which means, of course, more time for Big Business, their ideological think tanks and the Conservatives to cook up ways to sabotage this still unrealized national good.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Progressive groups did their best with the interim report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, which recommended creation of a national pharmaceutical drug agency, a comprehensive evidence-based formulary, and suggested core principles for national pharmacare. Several good-hearted organizations put out news releases calling the development “promising.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Canadians don’t need promises. They need pharmacare. And they need it now.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And so do the Liberals, oddly enough. Desperately so, right now, one would think.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But I guess the party of Justin Trudeau has discovered, as the old stories go, that once you’ve sold your soul, it’s very hard to get it back.</p>

I have mixed feelings about Liberals pharmacare idea. On the one hand it could be exactly what the country and they need. I think timing wise, it would probably be best to let the current bruhaha die down a bit before announcing it so it is not eclipsed by that. I think soon people will start to tire about talking about SNC Lavalin non stop and realize there are other important issue we need to get on with, so in the budget or shortly after that would probably be best.

On the other hand, we can remember all the Liberals promises on day care and what happened. I suppose we need to start somewhere, but they also need to start with something that is not too watered down or too ambitious to appeal to as many voters as possible. If it is not well thought out or too ambitious, it will just become another target for Conservatives and I don’t think the Liberals want that right now.

It never fails to boggle the mind how the Canadian electorate will vote for NDP-Lite, with promises of all these popular, helpful, progressive new programmes and policies, even though they’ll just get sunny ways conservatives instead of the humourless ScheerCon Conservatives, and not much will change for most ordinary Canadian families… when all they needed to do instead, was just vote for the genuine NDP and actually get those self-same progressive programmes & policies, but straight up instead of watered down to homeopathic proportions.

The extent to which the average Canadian border will inevitably vote against his or her own best interests remains to be plumbed to its fullest depths.

242,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Deficit hawks fall silent in Washington but screech in Alberta and Canada – what gives,2019-03-11 00:32:00,David Climenhaga,,"It’s starting to feel like spring, the days are longer, and the deficit hawks, apparently, have all flown north for the summer.

As a result, nowadays, the hawks’ angry shrieks are seldom heard in Washington!

“The federal budget deficit is ballooning on President Trump’s watch and few in Washington seem to care,” the Associated Press reported Saturday, the news service’s reporter not even trying to hide his sense of wonderment at this turn of events.

To the reporter’s credit, he was actually able to drum up a Washington deficit hawk shocked and appalled enough about this development to spend a few moments complaining before flocking off to wherever Republican Senators go on a weekend.

Here in Alberta, meanwhile, with an election looming, the unpleasant cacophony of the deficit hawks is almost deafening.

If the silence of the hawks in Washington is perplexing, the fact our Canadian Republican types – called conservatives on this side of the 49th Parallel owing to the fact our Dominion is not a republic – are singing a different song is also unusual.

There was a day when conservative political messaging was quite different in Canada than the United States, reflecting real cultural and historical differences between our countries. This remains the case on the left to a significant degree.


Vladimir Lenin, apparently an inspiration to the neoliberal right (Photo: Pavel Semyonovich Zhukov, 1870-1942, Public Domain).

But over the past 40 years or so, there has been a significant effort on the right to forge an international ideological consensus through promotion of institutions such as the worldwide network of utopian market fundamentalist “think tanks” and Astro-Turf groups, many funded by Washington-based organizations like the Atlas Network.

Our former prime minister, Stephen Harper plays a prominent role in this effort, and now heads the market fundamentalist Internationale based in Munich, Germany. This organization is called the International Democrat Union and, while it is certainly international, is only a union in the sense of, say, the Soviet Union, and its commitment to democratic principles is open to question.

Nevertheless, this approach has proved remarkably effective at creating a consistent international economic ideology on the right – which nowadays encompasses pretty well all the parties of the right, everywhere, plus some in the middle, even a few supposedly on the left.

Calling this doctrine neoliberalism may seem counterintuitive, as it’s neither new nor liberal, at least in the modern understanding of the latter term. But despite its flaws, it is probably the most precise term for this pervasive and pernicious ideology.

It must be observed that this ideological consistency is remarkably reminiscent of the now-moribund Communist movement of yore. If you read the musings of the admirers of Vladimir Lenin in this right-wing movement, people like the slovenly former Trump Administration chief ideologist Stephen K. Bannon, you will see this is quite intentional.

This is so striking, indeed, that one almost expects Mr. Harper to start numbering the IDU’s regular clambakes, starting with “the First Internationale,” or some such.

A key part of this consistent messaging is a supposed horror of deficits, which is universal and all encompassing on the political right … except when it’s not.

So if there is such a consensus on the right, how do we explain this remarkable divergence in the key talking points of the members of this international movement in Canada, especially Alberta, and in Washington?

The explanation is quite simple. It has been elucidated by a Nobel Prize winning economist, no less – although one, it must be admitted, whose views are not wholly in tune with the prevailing neoliberal ideological doctrine.

“Republicans spent the entire Obama Administration inveighing constantly about the dangers of debt, warning that America faced a looming crisis unless deficits were drastically reduced,” Paul Krugman wrote in his New York Times column soon after President Donald Trump’s inconveniently delayed Feb. 5 State of the Union message.

Any Canadian who is paying attention knows that the situation is exactly the same on this side of the border.

“Now that they’re in power, however,” Dr. Krugman continued, “and with the deficit surging thanks to a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich – they’ve totally dropped the subject.”

He quoted one of Mr. Trump’s senior officials on why the topic never came up in the SOTU: “Nobody cares.”

“Republicans never actually cared about debt,” Dr. Krugman explained. “They just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring President Obama’s agenda.”

The obsession “never had much basis in economic analysis,” he added. “Republicans rail against budget deficits when they’re out of power, then drop all concerns and send the deficit soaring once they are in a position to cut taxes. Then when it’s the Democrats’ turn, they’re expected to clean up the Republicans’ red ink rather than address their own priorities.”

This is what happened when Liberals and New Democrats won elections in Ottawa and Edmonton. Suddenly, deficits mattered again. It foretells exactly what will happen if Andrew Scheer or Jason Kenney come to power in the federal and Alberta elections expected soon. This is not just a pattern. It’s a strategy.

In Alberta, if Mr. Kenney manages to hang onto his party’s current substantial polling lead, our deficit will soar to unprecedented levels as a result of his planned program of tax cuts.

Of course, it will also become a convenient excuse to lay waste to public health care, education and the other valuable public social programs neoliberal ideology despises, but what commentary there is about the size of the debt and deficit will be shuffled off on the NDP or the Liberals.

As for the impact of cutting taxes on deficits and debt, all the usual suspects will fall strangely silent, just as they have in Washington. Screech? The deficit hawks won’t even tweet!

The Conservatives have at best a poor record at deficits. When Harper came into power Federally, along with Jason Kenney, they inherited a surplus from the Liberals, which quickly turned into a deficit and it remained that way for most of their 10 years. Of course now they are back to criticizing the Federal Liberals for running deficits, either showing a shameless hypocrisy or if they don’t like that, perhaps they can claim amnesia.

Likewise in Alberta, we have not been deficit free in Alberta for over 10 years. Over their long reign, the PC’s did have some good years and some bad years, but certainly this included a number of deficits. Lest we forget, the Saskatchewan Party next door that the UCP likes to hold up as a model is not running a surplus either, nor is their other favorite premier, Ontario PC leader Doug Ford. There is a budget coming soon in Ontario and I suspect it will be ugly, with a record amount of red ink. As is often the case the provinces who are actually in the best financial shape are those not run by the Conservatives or PC’s – BC and Quebec.

I suspect none of these facts will deter the UCP from continuing to natter on about deficits – Kenney does not seem the sort of a career politician to let the facts ever get in the way of his arguments, this does not surprise me. The more surprising thing is that some people fall for his bs.

Yeah.
So the right has been singularly focused on ‘winning’ for at least the last generation, perhaps since Regan/Thatcher/Mulroney.
Nothing else matters!
Say anything, do anything, or nothing – just win.
And when they do; not an intelligible governance plan articulated by any of them. Just loot the Treasury!

Today we have 2 existential crisis facing us. Both of which require political solutions.
1. Climate Change. It’s here and it will change everything but only for those left alive.
2. Fascism, Authoritarianism, Fundamentalism. Without a cohesive, rational and transparent strategy for liberal democracy around the world we are indeed a World In Disarray.

It’s been 75 years now since the world had to deal with such global crisis. Perhaps 80 million people were killed trying to make their point back then.
Unless we begin to aggressively pursue solutions to the above it’s likely that the casualties will be less this time around.

Conservative politicians exist to enrich themselves and give their campaign donors tax breaks while regressing us socially. Its christo-fascist plutocrats all the way down since before I was born. Why does anyone that isn’t a rich white Christian fanatic think that Kenney, a lifetime virgin because of his literalist religious ideals, would have any respect or concern for them? Kenney is Harper’s bitch: a voodoo economics/prosperity gospel shill. Is this province so greedy and stupid and ignorant of the past that it will buy policies that keep it as a failed Petro state?

As a conservative minded Albertan I am certainly concerned about fiscal responsibility for myself and my government. At a time when our government is running large deficits I certainly agree that it is counterintuitive to cut taxes. I also appreciate that we need to attract back private investment. Today’s economic environment both provincially and federally seems to involve a lot of subsidies to large corporations, is this different than a tax cut? A tax cut applies to all companies, subsidies to only a few. The Alberta NDP’s record on debt and their projected future debt isn’t so rosy either. According to their third quarter update by the end of 2023-2024 Alberta will have an accumulated debt of $94.8 billion. As part of this update they project a balanced budget based on $12.3 of non-renewable resource revenue up from $5.5 billion today. Does this sound possible? Then look at the interest we will pay on accumulated debt in 2023-2024, at 2.5% this amounts to $2.37 billion per year. Imagine if interest rates go up. This amounts to 58% of the $4.1 billion we collect this year in corporate tax. In my opinion it doesn’t matter who wins the next election it is a mess! Enjoy your day.

I’m torn between inappropriate amusement and total disgust, at our ability to willfully fail, when we’re given opportunities that only come once! Alberta is accidentally (according to geologists) situated over a poisoned chalice of riches. Much like Norway’s offshore. They and their 5 million citizens have amassed a Trillion (and growing at between 4 and 8% per year) dollar investment fund. They achieved this global superlative of economic prudence by emulating a premier of this province and his plan. They started pumping their revenue fifteen years after we did. All along they have paid 100% for their social programs and 100% for their military and foreign diplomatic presence. Arguable, their language is rather impossible! I guess that’s why Albertans just can’t get it!

The hack gap: how and why conservative nonsense dominates American politics

Matthew [email protected]@vox.com

excerpt: ‘something I’ve dubbed “the hack gap” over the years, and it’s one of the most fundamental asymmetries shaping American politics. While conservatives obsess over the (accurate) observation that the average straight news reporter has policy views that are closer to the Democratic Party than the Republican Party, the hack gap fundamentally does more to structure political discourse.

The hack gap explains why Clinton’s email server received more television news coverage than all policy issues combined in the 2016 election.’

excerpt: ‘The hack gap has two core pillars. One is the constellation of conservative media outlets — led by Fox News and other Rupert Murdoch properties like the Wall Street Journal editorial page, but also including Sinclair Broadcasting in local television, much of AM talk radio, and new media offerings such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller — that simply abjure anything resembling journalism in favor of propaganda.’

There once was a time, long ago—the 1970s & early 80s—when deficits were a real issue, because deficit financing of public spending drove interest rates sky-high and triggered double-digit inflation. I came of age during that time, so I well remember it. So, much of the focus of politics in the late 80s and early 90s was on balancing budgets, even if that meant heartless cuts to services ordinary people relied more on.

However, today things are different. For reasons that as a non-economist I don’t really understand, even the massive nearly trillion-dollar US government deficit doesn’t seem to be driving inflation or high interest rates. So, while Conservative politicians get into a swivet about deficits, the federal Liberals in particular seem to have nothing to worry about on that front—their recent unrelated problems notwithstanding—and in my view neither does the Alberta NDP, whose problems are not really about balancing the budget. Voters don’t seem to really care, and after all you can’t eat a balanced budget, or wear it, or drive a truck down it. We are also living through a period of record low and fairly static interest rates, and low inflation, so there’s no concern government spending is out of hand or unaffordable.

So, we have an incumbent NDP government that sees a slow, but sensible path to balancing the provincial budget, and resists the kind of radical changes that would make it happen any faster; and you have a Conservative party trying, without much success, to get people all in a tizzy about the deficit, when what they’re really worried about is will I have work next week or next month?

Maybe the UCP will own the next election, as everyone seems to think is a foregone conclusion. But, campaigns matter, and don’t count the Notley NDP out just yet.

You have missed another important way in which Neoliberals are like Communists. In addition to advocating a utopian system that has some merits but doesn’t quite work, as you rightly point out, they both claim the idealized world they pretend it will create is based on science. “Scientific socialism” and the “law of the market” are the same pseudo scientific claptrap, dressed up in slightly different clothes.

Back in the late ‘70s when I met for the first time a person, this one a student of economics at one of the universities in Southwestern Ontario, who was a member of the old Libertarian Party of Canada, the “Let’s Free Enterprise” guys, I made a similar observation after listening to his pitch. He didn’t follow and immediately launched into a lecture on what he referred to as the “economic pie” that ended with the assertion that, “There is no pie; there is no pie!” After I advised him that I hadn’t introduced the term into the discussion, he proceeded to browbeat me on socialistic ignorance of the marginal propensity of blah-blah-blah. When I asked him to define that term, I couldn’t follow him because he used it several times in his multi-paragraph explanation of its meaning. Then he got to the point. He was aware that my union and I personally had been involved recently in a job-action over issues of site contamination and work permit falsification that had caused a major project to be shut down. The lecture turned toward reality: if any other worker had been willing to continue under the conditions to which we had objected there should be no sets of social constructs preventing him from doing so; and that what had transpired was a costly violation of Market Law engendered by excessive regulation and made possible by restriction of individual worker rights.

If Mr. Trudeau is revealed as a tough guy who is not particularly nice to his MPs, under a mere veneer of sensitivity, Canadians, who have a history of liking tough leaders like the current PM’s Dear Ole Dad, may like him better.

It’s certainly true that the version of Mr. Trudeau now emerging from the wreckage of the SNC-Lavalin Affair shows him as not quite the warm and fuzzy high school drama teacher we were all so keen on when we were justifiably hell bent on getting rid of Stephen Harper. This is true even if Mr. Trudeau can still summon up a tear when circumstances warrant.

But the fact is, the recent record suggests Canadians don’t mind tough leaders. In fact, they may prefer them. Consider Mr. Harper himself, and Jean Chrétien, two of the more obvious electoral successes in recent Canadian political history.

Nor do Canadians seem to mind politicians switching their narrative from idealistic to tough – consider the old block himself, whence Justin Trudeau was chipped.


The younger Mr. Trudeau on the campaign trail, fall, 2015 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As a youth, I heard Pierre Trudeau speak before he had yet won the Liberal leadership. He sounded coolly intellectual and warmly idealistic, but he had not yet revealed the steel at his core. However, if any of us had really been paying attention we might have sensed it there.

What’s more, despite claims to the contrary, Canadian voters apparently don’t mind serial liars, an extreme lack of diplomacy or even an apparent degree of corruption in their politicians, as long as they give the impression of being tough enough. Consider the recent success of Doug Ford in Ontario and the apparent popularity of Jason Kenney here in Alberta, if the latest poll touted by the Calgary Herald, which acts as Mr. Kenney’s personal publicity department, is anything to go by.

As for leaders who are self evidently not so tough – Joe Clark, Kim Campbell and John Turner, the latter’s old-style male jockery notwithstanding, spring to mind – they seem not to have been so successful in the same epoch. (Brian Mulroney? I’m of two minds about him. More conniving than tough, methinks.)


Mr. Trudeau as he may soon appear to us (Photo: Duncan Cameron, Library and Archives Canada).

Consider the late Jim Prentice, premier of Alberta, who, among other things, didn’t appear to be as tough as the NDP’s Rachel Notley as election day neared in May 2015. Andrew Scheer, do you hear the wind whispering your name?

So don’t be too surprised if Canadians don’t mind all that much if Mr. Trudeau lets a new, steelier persona more like his late father’s emerge.

Right now, we are told, Mr. Trudeau’s personal popularity has taken a hit. But if I were a Liberal strategist, I would not panic about that, driven as it is by nearly hysterical Tweeting by Conservative operatives – the inspiration for which Mr. Scheer’s Conservative Party strategic advisors take from their Trumpian Republican mentors south of the imaginary line, and perhaps others.

More than one side can Tweet, after all, and having the National Post and Rebel Media in his corner is probably worth less to Mr. Scheer than he imagines. I guess if things get desperate for him, there’s always the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg.

But if I were the Liberals, I’d wait to see how the public adapts to the emerging new narrative, reasonably confident things would work out just fine for their guy’s electoral chances next fall. If necessary they can remind them what Senator Patrick Brazeau discovered about Mr. Trudeau’s right hook.

So don’t be surprised if we soon hear Mr. Trudeau uttering, as another tough old pol once did: “Just watch me!”","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

There is a dichotomy in democracies. We say we want leaders who listen and care, but more often than not we vote for the ones who have clear ideas of what they want and come across as strong leaders.

I remember when Jean Chretien grabbed the protestor who apparently was getting too close to him. The pundits thought the voters would be angry at him, but if anything it boosted his street cred. Of course Justin Trudeau had his own experience with this, they called Elbowgate.

I think when the dust settles, Lavscam will turn out to be overwrought. Justin does not go around saying “just watch me” like his dad did, his approach is more subtle and understated, but he has at various times been clear about the boundaries of his flexibility. He also plays for the long term, not the short term and I wouldn’t be surprised if he is letting his political opponents exhaust themselves by throwing all their punches now and waiting for the right moment to strike back, just as he did with Senator Brazeau.

I think Scheer and the Conservatives over played their hand by demanding Trudeau resign. People may not be that happy about Lavscam, but it is an abstract matter that has little to do with the day to day issues that concern most people. In hindsight that moment might turn out to be when Scheer and the Conservatives jumped the shark.

The throat grab certainly boosted Chertien’s credibility with me. Some violent punk slips past the dozing RCMP security and gets right in the face of the Prime Minister, an older man. He’s got a right to defend himself, and any sensible person with a set would do the same. The response was proportionate and appropriate.

I think you’ve got something there. The people that I know who disparage Justin most vehemently seem also to of the cut who are most in awe of guys who try to come across as though they’re tough or something. I’ve often thought of it as a reflex expressed in response to his generally good manners, often characterized by references to the drama-teacher and silver-spoon narratives. “He’s weak; he’s a pansy. Tough guys like me don’t like pansies.” The phony-tough never seem to realize that real tough guys don’t generally make it a habit of trashing the weaker because they know they’re not a threat. But the act is what they’re buying, and bullying and bag-licking are inextricably interwoven in the Canadian male psyche. Maybe the women aren’t any better.

They’re critical of him for the wrong reasons. Should he decide to adopt a tougher facade and portray the character that a lot of them are seeking in a leader, I expect that many of them will fall for it. And I’ll bet that he knows that too. (Just don’t pick fights with girls. Now he knows that one too.)

The fascist party are of course saying Trudeau should resign over a scandal that is trivial compared to the shit Harper pulled with Mike “Puffy” Duffy. Entitled cons will give themselves millions of taxpayer dollars to buy more luxuries and stock options but if Liberals game the system to try to keep a major firm in their ridings from imploding every Postmedia owned propaganda rag will attack and call for the death of the liberal party.
Conservatism is fascism. When cons slime their way into office they engage in completely self serving rule breaking and see nothing wrong with it. Wealth and whiteness equal infallibility to the conservative party.

I think you might be right, DJC—and what’s probably depressing JT’s numbers is that he’s looking too conciliatory. If he fired both rogue ministers out the door his numbers’d probably improve. It might seem perverse, but citizens like toughness because it guarantees the next episode will be worth watching (we are in the video age, in its literal sense, and have yet to conquer what we came upon over sixty years ago—visual entertainment in a jiffy); this is especially true during electoral contests (as opposed to parliamentary ones which aren’t so much ‘for-keeps’ and require the artifice of QP to make it the least bit watchable).

I did see PET in a state of fear, once—I was actually shaking his hand as he stepped out of his limo which was being chased by a mob of tomato-throwing protesters (I was carrying batteries for my news-cameraman father). But most came to know PET as irreverent and feisty—even tough (“just watch me.” I remember that so well—my neighbours and friends in Quebec City just absolutely hated him for that—and he absolutely loved it, I’m sure).

I disagree that Harper succeeded by way of his tough-guy antics; he was continually knocked about by one tougher Mulcair in parliament’s QP primetime —which sure didn’t help the NDP on Election Day (that difference between parliament and elections, again). Perhaps if Harper had gotten tough against racism he might have avoided his crucial, election fumble, the niqab ploy; but by trying to look tough for his base he seriously undermined his attempt to bore voters to death with one of the longest election campaign periods in modern history. A missed punch saps more energy than a landed one.

But I saw my MLA and newly-elected leader of the BC NDP be laughed out of contention for a rookie case of stage fright in front of news media, way back. Not tough enough, the Socred-friendly press peppered. Later I saw BC NDP leader Carole James shrink from finishing Premier Gordon Campbell off when his HST lie had him squirming on the floor (figuratively: he actually had a 9% approval rating —lower than the runner-up, Richard Nixon)—and then try to get tough, except against her own caucus members whose constituents were complaining about her passivity during this easy dirking opportunity, and that nearly tore the party apart when it should have been getting its trophy pic taken over the slain dragon.

Then I saw my guy John Horgan suffer a whisper campaign on the convention floor during the subsequent leadership contest to replace the bounced Ms James: he was said to have an uncontrollable temper (this thinly-veiled prejudice against people of Irish ancestry was enough to make a fellow Gael like me lose my cool and smash some china). He lost to Adrian Dix who went on to prove that, while being reasonably pacific during the parliamentary phase of politics, his “positive politcs” edict that prohibited any of his candidates to say anything negative about our rival was absolutely idiotic during the campaign phase. (My guy was acclaimed after Dix blew a 20-point lead against the bubbleheaded Christy Clark and resigned during his abject concession speech; and since Dix has subsequently made a fine minister of health, all is forgiven—except lack of toughness during campaigns can never be, ever.)

One more BC example: when then-premier Christy perfunctorily took a pre-campaign swipe at the new NDP leader by accusing his party of hacking her party’s website—something a James or a Dix would not deign to respond to—Horgan had a lawsuit lined up so fast it scared Christy into totally uncharacteristic civility for the remainder of the campaign (she barely won a minority, then lost it in the first vote in the Assembly against the two tough-guys, Horgan and Weaver of the Greens). The lesson was that if you get punched, punch back, and if you punch back you won’t likely get punched anymore.

This is apropos because we are currently in virtual election campaign mode, just seven months to go. My squeeze lives in Jody’s riding and doesn’t think she could win it as an Independent —but that it’ll probably go Liberal anyway, as it has done for a long time, whomever runs there. JT could fire her and not lose this riding—while most of the other Liberal ridings won in BC last time on promises of reconciliation and environmentalism will be lost to—to—to—uh, somebody (Cons, NDP, Greens?…even Bernier’s People’s Party won 11% in the recent by-election Jagmeet won) mostly because of TMX which voters in the vote-rich Vancouver region absolutely hate.

I think Scheer is blowing his own advantages by endorsing neo-nazis and ramping his anti-JT rhetoric up to levels generally regarded as lame and ridiculous. We’ve yet to see how tough Jagmeet will be (I hadn’t seen a Kirpan but heard lots of thinly-veiled racist comments about wearing religious signifiers in parliament— which he’s yet to attend, turban and all—but I’m betting he can be tough—if the pacifist ideologues in Dipperland don’t mind, of course). Is Elizabeth May tough? You know it! Bernier? Maybe with la Meute standing behind him, for whatever good that’ll do him—he’s not bright enough to discern.

So how does JT stack up? I think his quest for gravitas started early with his issuance of permits to accelerate the construction of the Site-C damn in BC, even as Treaty 8 Nations had filed Federal Court papers to seek injunction. I think he was trying to assuage fears that he was cowtowing to First Nations, his reconciliation campaign rhetoric, and all; likewise his TMX push which, as we know, hasn’t bought him much thanks in Alberta, the province which will most bebenfit from this policy—but it was rather a bid for national gravitas, not regional acceptance (although I wonder if he might have been trying to also reconcile Alberta with Ottawa after his father so blithely dismissed the province’s objection to the National Energy Program. Rookie naivety, perhaps? I dunno—sure hasn’t got him much).

So, all of this notwithstanding, the measure of JT’s toughness will be made, it looks like—if nothing else pops up, upon his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Or, should I say, how he handles the two rogue ministers? It seems there must have been some conspiracy between the two, which is why I think Philpott resigned: to avoid cabinet cross-examination that might prove her culpability, specifically that she egged Jody on to act like a tough-guy. Perhaps JT is prudently awaiting further discoveries in this respect—like, who else might be involved—before bringing the hammer down. He’s the leader, he has to do something.

And cranking up the tough-guy aspect on this or any issue probably won’t hurt him one bit. I agree: it’s more likely to help.

Be careful what you wish for is right on! I don’t support either Liberals or Conservatives but even though it now appears Trudeau to be much less than advertised, he is still the lesser of two bad choices and I think Canadians prefer him and the Liberal brand to that of the austerity loving Cons.

Rachel Notley is premier of Alberta not because Albertans suddenly turned to the NDP in 2015. They turned against the austerity that Jim Prentice was going to inflict on them through his proposed 2015 budget instead of looking in the mirror and seeing themselves as the creators of Alberta’s economic problems. Prentice mistake was in telling voters before an election. And they might yet come to realize what’s in store for them after a UCP victory at the polls this year.

Pogo: of course Albertans want that, and they want it good and hard. They know they have been bad little boys and girlies and fiddled away another, and probably the last oil boom we will ever see. They also know deep in their self-centered little hearts that like big tobacco, big oil will soon be faced with bankruptcy. So bring on the whips and leather, its retribution time for the sinners.

240,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,What would Green Party of Canada Leader Elizabeth May do in Rachel Notley’s shoes? Not the same thing as Alberta’s premier,2019-03-13 01:08:00,David Climenhaga,,"What would have Elizabeth May have done in Rachel Notley’s shoes?

The leader of the Green Party of Canada says she would have summoned up the memory of Peter Lougheed, founder of Alberta’s 44-year Progressive Conservative Dynasty, but not the way the province’s first NDP premier has.


Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“I think that Albertans are reasonable,” Ms. May said during a short, 15-minute interview before she gave a talk with students and faculty at The King’s University in Edmonton Friday. “If you present the facts, and say, ‘Look, we had this plan from Peter Lougheed, let’s revisit it,” she argued, Albertans and other Canadians could find common ground.

Ms. Notley took a different road, with which the member of Parliament for Saanich and the Islands disagrees profoundly, describing Alberta’s approach “an abdication of responsibility.”

To the right of Ralph Klein on oil?

“If I had been her advisor, and I certainly tried to communicate this to her, given the political landscape, I would have sought out reclaiming the moral high ground of Peter Lougheed,” Ms. May told me. “I would have distanced myself from trying to be to the right of Ralph Klein on oil and gas, which is where I think she’s placed herself.”

Premier Notley, in the Green Party leader’s view, should have asked Albertans to look back at what Mr. Lougheed advised, to wit, developing processing infrastructure in Alberta. “Let’s look at taking a business case to the rest of Canada that we’d like to see them stop importing all foreign oil, and use Canadian product,” she said.

She recalled how, the only time she met Alberta’s premier, she told her: “You should brand it Fort Mac Strong and sell it across Canada as a branded Alberta product. And I don’t think there’s a Canadian who wouldn’t prefer, as long as we are using fossil fuels, to use Fort Mac Strong than Saudi or Nigerian.”

No expansion of the oilsands

“We could say, well, on a declining basis, in exchange for no expansion of the oil sands, this is a good way to go forward. And I think she could have sold that.” But “it’s too late now,” Ms. May lamented.


Cheryle Chagnon-Greyeyes, leader of the Green Party of Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Well, maybe Albertans would have listened, maybe not. But they certainly deserve to hear what Ms. May has to say. She may only lead a Parliamentary caucus of one, but she speaks for many more Canadians – leastways, outside Alberta, and this debate isn’t going away.

So it should concern Albertans that Ms. May’s two days in our province – Thursday in Calgary and Friday in Edmonton, with a long bus ride in between because that was the lowest-carbon travel option – were all but ignored by mainstream media. This has certainly not been the case elsewhere on her cross-Canada “community matters tour.”

In Alberta Ms. May was accompanied by Cheryle Chagnon-Greyeyes, leader of the provincial Green Party. And, yes, despite heavy snow last Friday, they showed up at the King’s campus in a small electric car.

The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion

Like most serious environmentalists, Ms. May puts carbon emissions and climate change at the heart of the debate over the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, although she is highly critical of economic arguments for the project.

Neither the Alberta NDP nor Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals really have a carbon reduction plan, she asserted. “She has a carbon expansion policy,” Ms. May said of Premier Notley. “The goal of the Alberta government is to increase greenhouse gases. She wants to go to 100 megatonnes of carbon a year, from 70 megatonnes of carbon a year.”

“The cap is way above where we are right now, and we’re in a climate emergency,” she stated. “We can’t afford to expand greenhouse gases!”

But what about other aspects of Alberta’s carbon reduction plan? “Well, ‘We’re going to go off coal for Alberta’s electricity,’” she said, paraphrasing part of the Alberta Government’s position. “Which would be fantastic if we were going to 100-per-cent renewables. But she wants to go to fracked natural gas, burned in the same plants that were once burning coal. Which means it will be inefficient. … So, in the end, there won’t be much reduction.”

Selling out the climate?

“To me it was a political trade-off, but not one that was relevant to climate science,” Ms. May said. “That’s a condemnation of both Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley for being willing to sell out climate in the interests of a papered-over political win.”


British Columbia Premier John Horgan (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As for the economic case made by the two governments for the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, Ms. May was scornful. “The National Energy Board … said that on the list of issues (it) was supposed to investigate during this hearing, jobs and the economy weren’t included. Then how on earth can it be that the National Energy Board tells the Trudeau administration, as they did in the first instance and now the second instance, ‘We’ve looked at all these harms that will occur, but the benefits for the economy outweigh the harms’?”

“I’m very happy if I can fight the … pipeline solely on the basis of economics, because it loses on the economics,” she stated.

A ‘targeted attack’ on the people of B.C.

Ms. May is angered by the Alberta NDP’s $23-million national advertising campaign. “Rachel Notley’s ad campaign, which we now know from access to information requests was premised on the idea of getting people to be angry at B.C., it was a very targeted attack at the people of British Columbia and our government.”

She praised B.C.’s NDP premier, John Horgan, for not responding in kind. But, she added, “I really regret that he hasn’t taken on the lies in the ad campaign, clearly, so that people can see that they’re lies.”

Did she have an example of a lie? Consider the claim Canada is, or at least was, losing $80 million a day because of the price differential between Alberta crude and Texas oil. “That’s not true! And it doesn’t take more than 15 minutes of Google searches for economists who’ve crunched the numbers to know that isn’t true.” Claims the pipeline expansion will generate permanent jobs? She calls them “bogus.”

Faint sympathy for Rachel Notley

So does Ms. May have any sympathy for Premier Notley’s political predicament? “Yes. But I think she’d done the absolutely worst thing for her own self, strategically. I don’t think the NDP can win an election in Alberta by being more pro-oil than Jason Kenney. It’s a political miscalculation.” She continued, with a certain tone: “Do I feel sorry for her? Sure. I’m a charitable person. But she’s done something that is essentially unforgivable in that she is fighting, hard, to eliminate a viable future for our children. And that is not acceptable. She has to know better.”


Premier Peter Lougheed, founder of Alberta’s Conservative Dynasty (Photo: Provincial Archives of Alberta).

Opponents of the NDP will take Ms. May’s comments as more evidence the NDP’s efforts to win “social license” for expansion of Alberta’s oil industry have failed. As has been said here before, though, the opposite is probably true.

But as angry rhetoric toward other parts of Canada escalates among both Alberta New Democrats and their Conservative challengers, this inter-provincial dispute may get harder, not easier, to resolve. Ms. May characterized Ms. Notley’s remarks about British Columbia as “vicious” and “divisive.”

“Of course she does better things on the social justice side of the ledger for Albertans,” Ms. May observed. “But on climate change, she’s led the charge toward extinction. And it’s not a good record.”

And don’t count on this approach to pipeline building ever being effective on the West Coast, the Green leader added. “Opposition in British Columbia isn’t going away.”

Greens in the next Parliament

Nor is the Green Party of Canada, she vowed. Indeed, with a little vote-splitting from Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, the Greens could end up able “to exercise a balance of responsibility in Parliament,” she mused.

“We’re going to have lots of seats,” she predicted. “I’m more than happy to work with New Democrats, or Liberals, or responsible Conservatives. Wherever we find people who want to think about the issues, and come to a consensus of what do we need to do now really.”

“Let’s take this seriously and find the solutions that advance the interests of Albertans, and the interests of British Columbians, and of people from Ontario,” she concludes. “We’re a country, not warring factions.”

  <p class=""p1"">What would have Elizabeth May have done in Rachel Notley’s shoes?</p>
<p class=""p1"">The leader of the Green Party of Canada says she would have summoned up the memory of Peter Lougheed, founder of Alberta’s 44-year Progressive Conservative Dynasty, but not the way the province’s first NDP premier has.</p>

Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">“I think that Albertans are reasonable,” Ms. May said during a short, 15-minute interview before she gave a talk with students and faculty at The King’s University in Edmonton Friday. “If you present the facts, and say, ‘Look, we had this plan from Peter Lougheed, let’s revisit it,” she argued, Albertans and other Canadians could find common ground.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ms. Notley took a different road, with which the member of Parliament for Saanich and the Islands disagrees profoundly, describing Alberta’s approach “an abdication of responsibility.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>To the right of Ralph Klein on oil?</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">“If I had been her advisor, and I certainly tried to communicate this to her, given the political landscape, I would have sought out reclaiming the moral high ground of Peter Lougheed,” Ms. May told me. “I would have distanced myself from trying to be to the right of Ralph Klein on oil and gas, which is where I think she’s placed herself.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Premier Notley, in the Green Party leader’s view, should have asked Albertans to look back at what Mr. Lougheed advised, to wit, developing processing infrastructure in Alberta. “Let’s look at taking a business case to the rest of Canada that we’d like to see them stop importing all foreign oil, and use Canadian product,” she said.</p>
<p class=""p1"">She recalled how, the only time she met Alberta’s premier, she told her: “You should brand it <i>Fort Mac Strong</i> and sell it across Canada as a branded Alberta product. And I don’t think there’s a Canadian who wouldn’t prefer, as long as we are using fossil fuels, to use <i>Fort Mac Strong</i> than Saudi or Nigerian.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>No expansion of the oilsands</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">“We could say, well, on a declining basis, in exchange for no expansion of the oil sands, this is a good way to go forward. And I think she could have sold that.” But “it’s too late now,” Ms. May lamented.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_29799"" style=""width: 279px;""><img width=""269"" height=""450"" class="" wp-image-29799"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-29799"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greyeyes-179x300.jpeg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greyeyes-179x300.jpeg 179w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greyeyes.jpeg 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-29799"">Cheryle Chagnon-Greyeyes, leader of the Green Party of Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Well, maybe Albertans would have listened, maybe not. But they certainly deserve to hear what Ms. May has to say. She may only lead a Parliamentary caucus of one, but she speaks for many more Canadians – leastways, outside Alberta, and this debate isn’t going away.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So it should concern Albertans that Ms. May’s two days in our province – Thursday in Calgary and Friday in Edmonton, with a long bus ride in between because that was the lowest-carbon travel option – were all but ignored by mainstream media. This has certainly not been the case elsewhere on her cross-Canada “community matters tour.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Alberta Ms. May was accompanied by Cheryle Chagnon-Greyeyes, leader of the provincial Green Party. And, yes, despite heavy snow last Friday, they showed up at the King’s campus in a small electric car.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Like most serious environmentalists, Ms. May puts carbon emissions and climate change at the heart of the debate over the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, although she is highly critical of economic arguments for the project.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Neither the Alberta NDP nor Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals really have a carbon reduction plan, she asserted. “She has a carbon <i>expansion</i> policy,” Ms. May said of Premier Notley. “The goal of the Alberta government is to <i>increase</i> greenhouse gases. She wants to go to 100 megatonnes of carbon a year, from 70 megatonnes of carbon a year.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“The cap is way above where we are right now, and we’re in a climate emergency,” she stated. “We can’t afford to expand greenhouse gases!”</p>
<p class=""p1"">But what about other aspects of Alberta’s carbon reduction plan? “Well, ‘We’re going to go off coal for Alberta’s electricity,’” she said, paraphrasing part of the Alberta Government’s position. “Which would be fantastic if we were going to 100-per-cent renewables. But she wants to go to fracked natural gas, burned in the same plants that were once burning coal. Which means it will be inefficient. … So, in the end, there won’t be much reduction.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Selling out the climate?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">“To me it was a political trade-off, but not one that was relevant to climate science,” Ms. May said. “That’s a condemnation of both Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley for being willing to sell out climate in the interests of a papered-over political win.”</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" id=""attachment_29798"" style=""width: 275px;""><img width=""265"" height=""421"" class="" wp-image-29798"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-29798"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Horgan-1-189x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Horgan-1-189x300.jpg 189w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Horgan-1.jpg 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-29798"">British Columbia Premier John Horgan (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">As for the economic case made by the two governments for the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, Ms. May was scornful. “The National Energy Board … said that on the list of issues (it) was supposed to investigate during this hearing, jobs and the economy weren’t included. Then how on earth can it be that the National Energy Board tells the Trudeau administration, as they did in the first instance and now the second instance, ‘We’ve looked at all these harms that will occur, but the benefits for the economy outweigh the harms’?”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I’m very happy if I can fight the … pipeline solely on the basis of economics, because it loses on the economics,” she stated.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>A ‘targeted attack’ on the people of B.C.</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Ms. May is angered by the Alberta NDP’s $23-million national advertising campaign. “Rachel Notley’s ad campaign, which we now know from access to information requests was premised on the idea of getting people to be angry at B.C., it was a very targeted attack at the people of British Columbia and our government.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">She praised B.C.’s NDP premier, John Horgan, for not responding in kind. But, she added, “I really regret that he hasn’t taken on the lies in the ad campaign, clearly, so that people can see that they’re lies.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Did she have an example of a lie? Consider the claim Canada is, or at least was, losing $80 million a day because of the price differential between Alberta crude and Texas oil. “<i>That’s not true! </i>And it doesn’t take more than 15 minutes of Google searches for economists who’ve crunched the numbers to know that isn’t true.” Claims the pipeline expansion will generate permanent jobs? She calls them “bogus.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Faint sympathy for Rachel Notley</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">So does Ms. May have any sympathy for Premier Notley’s political predicament? “Yes. But I think she’d done the absolutely worst thing for her own self, strategically. I don’t think the NDP can win an election in Alberta by being more pro-oil than Jason Kenney. It’s a political miscalculation.” She continued, with a certain tone: “Do I feel sorry for her? Sure. I’m a <i>charitable</i> person. But she’s done something that is essentially unforgivable in that she is fighting, hard, to eliminate a viable future for our children. And that is not acceptable. She has to know better.”</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_29809"" style=""width: 293px;""><img width=""283"" height=""391"" class="" wp-image-29809"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-29809"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/PL-217x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/PL-217x300.jpg 217w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/PL.jpg 600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-29809"">Premier Peter Lougheed, founder of Alberta’s Conservative Dynasty (Photo: Provincial Archives of Alberta).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Opponents of the NDP will take Ms. May’s comments as more evidence the NDP’s efforts to win “social license” for expansion of Alberta’s oil industry have failed. As has been said here before, though, the opposite is probably true.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But as angry rhetoric toward other parts of Canada escalates among both Alberta New Democrats and their Conservative challengers, this inter-provincial dispute may get harder, not easier, to resolve. Ms. May characterized Ms. Notley’s remarks about British Columbia as “vicious” and “divisive.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Of course she does better things on the social justice side of the ledger for Albertans,” Ms. May observed. “But on climate change, she’s led the charge toward extinction. And it’s not a good record.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">And don’t count on this approach to pipeline building ever being effective on the West Coast, the Green leader added. “Opposition in British Columbia isn’t going away.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Greens in the next Parliament</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Nor is the Green Party of Canada, she vowed. Indeed, with a little vote-splitting from Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, the Greens could end up able “to exercise a balance of responsibility in Parliament,” she mused.</p>

“Opponents of the NDP will take Ms. May’s comments as more evidence the NDP’s efforts to win ‘social license’ for expansion of Alberta’s oil industry have failed.”

What about SCIENTIFIC license?
No mainstream climate scientist or scientific institution supports fossil fuel expansion.
In opposition, the AB NDP were the only voice of sanity on climate and energy. Notley has eliminated that option.

Now we have zero oil industry critics in the AB Legislature. And there won’t be any after 2019. Banished to opposition benches, the NDP will be able to say nothing about oilsands expansion, oil & gas pollution, and climate inaction — because they sided with Big Oil in office.
We no longer have a mainstream party that champions science.
We no longer have a progressive party in the NDP.
The AB NDP took away our last hope for real action on climate in AB.

Notley has done irreparable damage to the AB NDP’s progressive brand. For what? A landslide defeat this May.

Elizabeth May: “The cap is way above where we are right now, and we’re in a climate emergency. We can’t afford to expand greenhouse gases!”

The Int’l Energy Agency agrees:
“There is already no more room to increase the amount of pollution that humans add each year to the atmosphere. All of the cars, trucks, power plants, factories and other facilities that have already been built around the world will eat up the rest of the planet’s so-called “carbon budget”
“A full 95% of the planet’s remaining carbon budget will be eaten up by existing infrastructure.
“‘We have no room to maneuver, in other words. If we want to be in line with the Paris target, we wouldn’t build any non-zero carbon plants, no new cars, no new factories…'”

Elizabeth May: “That’s a condemnation of both Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley for being willing to sell out climate in the interests of a papered-over political win.”

The plan to fail was hatched by Big Oil and Canada’s business community years before Trudeau and Notley came to office.
In his book, “The Big Stall: How Big Oil and Think Tanks are Blocking Action on Climate Change in Canada”, Donald Gutstein details how neoliberal “progressive” politicians like Trudeau and Notley subverted the climate change agenda and enabled Big Oil’s “predatory delay”:“The Rise and Fall of Trudeau’s ‘Grand Bargain’ on Climate” (The Tyee, 14 Nov 2018)

Unconscionably, several big ENGOs signed on to AB’s plan to fail. Some, like Tzeporah Berman, have since backed away, but others like Pembina’s Ed Whittingham continue to defend the deal. (The NDP just appointed him to the Alberta Energy Regulator board, lighting conspiracy theorist Vivian Krause’s hair on fire.)

Our house is on fire. The only rational response is to put the fire out. Notley and Trudeau are fuelling the flames!

Just how many seats do the Greens and Elizabeth May have in Alberta, or in any province other than BC actually? While I do take her fairly seriously, I don’t disagree with some of what she is saying and I think she is a credible representative of her party, but her party and views are not the political mainstream or even close. Maybe that will change in the future, or maybe not.

In any event it is easy for her to put forth certain ideas because she has no seats in Alberta to lose or Alberta MP’s to give her feedback. At least to her credit, she is not one of those celebrity fly over types that helicopter in to Fort McMurray take some video of oilsands operations, proclaim how terrible it is and then fly back to where ever it is they came from without talking to the people whose livelihood depends on these operations. Its good that she has visited Calgary and Edmonton recently, but I hope she would stop in a few more places along the way in Alberta, like some of those communities that are dependent on the energy industry. Would it change her mind? I doubt it, but perhaps it would broaden her perspective a bit, which might be a good thing because the Greens have a very black and white view of things when it comes to the environment and the energy industry. The world does not so easily fit into such preconceived notions.

If the next Parliament unfolds the way Ms. May hopes and dreams, she wouldn’t need many to hold the balance of power, or, as she put it, the balance of responsibility. And it wouldn’t really matter if they all came from one region, say, Vancouver island. Personally, I think that is unlikely in the present scheme of things, which, as we have seen, the perennial winners have no desire to change – for obvious reasons. Still, there is more than one way to skin a cat, and one of them is by infiltration of another party – as utopian market fundamentalists came to possess the conservative parties of yore, which once upon a time in Canada were actually conservative in the plain meaning of that word. Change is coming on this front because survival requires it. Will it be too late? Maybe. DJC

David:
I wish I could hold out more hope for the efficacy of the infiltration strategy. My own observation of, and experience in, the BC NDP over the past ~ 30 years is that members/activists of a greenish tendency are consistently marginalized and kept pretty harmless, although they get just enough of a trickle of symbolic nods to keep a few in the fold. But there never are enough of them to create a critical mass that exerts an effective veto over policy in that domain. In contrast, it’s instructive to see how quickly the rise of transgender activism has solidified into an internal constituency (also in major unions and labour federations) whose recognition is now part of the dominant orthodoxy.

Why the difference? People whose main impetus for activism is environmental concern – now focused predominantly on the climate crisis – often come at this independently of the recruitment pathways that have traditionally brought trade unionists, feminists, and many other flavors of social justice activists into social democratic parties. Coming from diverse backgrounds which include strong representation from non-ideological middle-class do-goodism and those with hardcore training in environmental science, there’s generally a pretty weak matching to the traditional ideological spectrum. So that’s why we find such a weird coexistence of flaky libertarianism and ecosocialist tendencies expressed in existing “Green” parties. And it’s why only a fairly small minority of the overall population of green-priority voters and activists will ever commit themselves to a particular political outlet.

Some of the residual rump of greenish activists in the BC NDP initially saw the Green-NDP power-sharing agreement as being more promising than it has turned out be. Their hope was that this would lever stronger stands than the NDP would otherwise adopt on its own. However, the ascendancy of the “Brown” tendency under Horgan (i.e. continuing strong influence from the building trade unions despite reforms to political fundraising), combined with the continuing influence of the Carol James-style of militant timidity, meant that Site C and LNG development were probably inevitable. And despite (or perhaps because of) Andrew Weaver’s high regard for his own political skills, he was simply outsmarted when the confidence and supply agreement was drawn up. With the dramatic collapse of the Green vote in the recent Nanaimo byelection, he is now greatly weakened AND the internal greenish rump inside the NDP can’t argue convincingly that stronger policy stands are needed to prevent vote bleeding to the Greens. (I can imagine a Provincial Secretary asking, “And how many divisions do the Greens have?”)

All in all, not a pretty picture. But at least it’s not quite as bleak as the prospects in Alberta. As one of your other commenters always says, “enjoy your day”.

“… the Greens have a very black and white view of things when it comes to the environment and the energy industry. The world does not so easily fit into such preconceived notions.”

Unfortunately, planet Earth is not open to compromise. The laws of physics are not open for debate. The science is black and white. The climate does not care one whit about human politics.
It’s up to us to adapt to nature’s realities and limits, not the other way around.
In face of climate change, Albertans who insist on pipelines (now on both sides of the spectrum) are like small children who stamp their feet: “But I want to!”
Either we change the way we live, or the Earth will change it for us.

Hi David… “The Greens have a very black and white view of things..” especially climate science. Your comments suggest the social science concerns would broaden their perspective, perhaps make their climate policies more acceptable. The physical sciences underlying climate change, like physics and chemistry, are not influenced by social upheaval. It is a “black and white “ kind of thing, and the physical sciences are paramount. As E.O.Wilson said, “All biological processes are obedient to physics and chemistry .”

The world is ultimately governed by the physical sciences; policies intended to address climate change have to reflect this hard truth.

Alberta currently has no Green MP’s. There are several very viable potential candidates who could win seats.

As to the results of the next election, I anticipate that Ms. May will not sit alone. The East Coast will elect several MP’s. Ontario and Quebec have the potential to put Greens in office. Manitoba has several potential candidates who can win.

The Greens have not folded into big business control. They do not wish to ‘buy jobs’ as other parties have done. Yes, you are correct in saying that the Greens are ‘not mainstream’. This means that they would do things a bit differently. Energy diversification is one of those. Refining of petroleum in the Province is one aspect that cannot be ignored. Permanent jobs result with higher pay scales to help maintain the Alberta economy.

You hear about pipelines and how the Greens are against them. Not quite the case. Greens would prefer that pipelines carry less damaging products than diluted bitumen. Specifically, refined products.

Should you have the desire to do so, you will find that the Greens are not a ‘one trick pony’, and have developed policy that encompasses all parts of our economy. Sustainability is the key word in the Green Party plans.

“… or responsible Conservatives” ??? no such an animal in these parts!

It’s more than a little interesting to hear from someone outside of and away from the nexus of the CAPP campus and the ‘Ledge. The utter lack of truth-telling and facts coupled with the preponderance of partisan one-upmanship that passes for political insight is well know by now around these here parts. May’s comments are a bit like the child pointing out that the King is, in fact, naked, unclothed!
Albertans, in general and Notley, in particular do not have a leg to stand on when it comes to environmental and petroleum policy. They have, collectively, missed the next train to the future.
There is no future in petroleum, as premised by the glories of the past. Even Norway is weaning itself away from a reliance on petroleum – and if there is any jurisdiction in the world that Alberta should be paying attention to now, it’s Norway. Not least because it is, in fact, a world-class energy economy, unlike so many of the empty boasts by so many Albertan blow-hards. There will be petroleum in our future but it will not be anything like the past; many less people, much more regulation, more like a utility, less independent entrepreneur.
There is no such thing as social license either. It’s just an in-group, us versus them bunch of clap-trap. It’s a regionalist and classist prejudice foisted on an ignorant, fearful and largely unthinking population by a cabal of a few wealthy petro-corp shareholders, some nakedly covetous political aspirants and a pliant and corrupt media.
A few unhealthy sociopaths had a good thing going during the idiocy of the Klien era and they don’t want to give it up. Who can blame ’em? But that does not translate into viable socio-economic policy for a province or a country or a path forward into a 21rst Century future

Premier Rachel Notley’s strategy has been to seed policies which take more years than a single term of government to fruit while, at the same time, tending to the garden of public enterprise and services during a drought of petroleum revenues. The voters who elected her, however, were much more tactical and may turn as many ways and as many times as they want during a single term of government. Last election their prime motivation was to turn a tired government of forty-odd years out of office (it’d been stumbling for a decade and evaporated completely after the NDP’s upset victory). It might well have been that many voters didn’t give much thought to what an NDP government would do but, rather, figured it couldn’t do much worse than the one they just rejected and could be gotten rid of before any granny-state policies could come into fruition, after which a reformed party of the right could then be (“re~”) elected.

In the equivocal way of the right these days, voters can parry with the fact that the party of the right in Alberta contention right now is not really a conservative party they might expect it to be by countering that neither is the NDP what they expected it to be. There, thinking process of your average voter done!

What voters who are likely to vote UCP expect is a pipeline to the West Coast and expansion of bitumen mining. Thus, if there’s any hope of Notley winning a second term—as her strategy demands—she has to get a pipeline together and expand bitumen mining in order to capture enough of voters of practical, as opposed to ideological, partisanship—that is, tactical, fairweather partisanship. Having substantially done the preparation—to an extent unprecedented by any conservative government—she has to present her party to voters as the little engine that could: “I think-we-can; I-think-we-can; I-think-we-can…” while pointing eagerly to measures already accomplished— again, not insubstantial, and superlative to anything hitherto.

To any voters not mentally paralyzed by chauvinism—and the PC’s defeat means there must be some, at least sometimes—their attention, if gotten, must turn thence from those accomplishments to the question of the NDP’s ostensible, longterm commitment to the bitumen industry. They might even be pleasantly surprised, for the moment, but be as easily swayed to UCP cynicism that, no matter what the parked-vote NDP says or does it’s simply a trick to sneak in higher taxes (in Alberta the traditional sales-tax bogeyman is now joined with the carbon tax), promote gay lifestyles and abortions and generally botch up even a reasonable plan for the bitumen industry.

One has to wonder if the NDP could have captured the default vote if it had promised anything other than the status quo position on bitumen mining and dilbit pipelines. Once it did win that default vote, what could Notley possibly do but compete directly with Jason KeKKenny’s UCP for the blue-ribbon, Biggest Bitumen Booster prize? Was there any other strategy for her but winning more than one mandate?

I have my sympathies for Ms Notley’s predicamnet. But it stops at the targeted vitriol towards BC. If she’s decided to parry with KeKKenny for the same turf, she should have targeted him instead. He might criticize spending public dollars for the demonization propaganda—but only hypocritically because it tops what his party has to spend doing exactly what he’d like to do if he held the public purse strings. To his mind, that’s “unfair” and of course, if he ever does win power, it’ll justify righteous revenge by spending even more on the same thing and demonizing everything that could possibly be connected to the NDP. (Don’t worry, there won’t be any pipeline built before the next Alberta election likely this spring and, if Kekkenney wins, he’ll claim the credit for whatever part of it looks successful and blame JT and Notley for what doesn’t.) Naturally, KeKKenney would pay for this kind of self-serving stuff by cutting social services—at least Ms Notley contrast with him in this respect.

So the NDP can only win by winning the next election: as mentioned above, an NDP Opposition wouldn’t have an environmental leg to stand on when criticizing UCP pipeline and bitumen mining expansion.

Does Notley have to worry about the Greens? After burning environmental bridges behind her, I should think so, but probably not so much from the Alberta Greens, rather from BC federal Greens where Ms May’s riding is and to which one provincial Green seat attached geographically, then two more, contiguously, all on the Island, which now hold the balance of power in the BC Assembly. With opposition to TMX so strong on the Coast, I expect the federal Greens will continue to prosper there. Hey, they could double their seats!

And lets remember that the BC NDP minority government the BC Greens support has disappointed and angered Dipper environmentalists with respect LNG pipelines, the Site-C dam, fish-farm policy and other things. Given that stiffening opposition to TMX and shipping dilbit through inside waters is of primary concern to Albertans, it’s worth their consideration whether the Greens continue to ascend provincially in BC. It’s too early yet to speculate about the next BC election scheduled for Spring, 2021: we have Albertan, Canadian and American elections in the interim, all of which will feature strengthening environmental concerns, and none of which will jive with Notley’s bitumen expansionism.

You just gotta feel a little bit sorry for Ms Notley.

Just a little bit.

Her primal misjudgment was imagining that her election was anything other than a lucky, one-time combination of voter fatigue with the old PCs AND a split on the right.

She would have done well to remember how Dave Barrett assessed his unexpected good fortune in 1972, asking at his first Cabinet meeting, “Are we here for a good time, or a long time?”

Yes, give her credit for several overdue modernizations of public services that briefly returned AB to the orbit of Canadian norms, instead of the Kuiper belt of market fundamentalism.

But such missed opportunities! There were so many rocks left unturned, where multiple public inquiries could have effectively armed them for their inevitable resumption of Opposition duties: the inner workings of AB’s captured energy regulator, the true debt of contaminated sites with abandoned wells, the real magnitude of hidden subsidies to the oil industry — just for starters.

Such a pity to have squandered this one chance!

Do you suppose she might be keeping some of this powder dry for the upcoming contest?

I know in BC the Green-Dippers have been advised to use the treasure trove of BC Liberal perfidy now in their possession to discredit their predecessor and (still) main rival in good time for the next election in 2021. They’ve been rolling some of it out more often these days, but it’s a process that takes time to sink through the boney protective cranial armour of the average voter—so I’m glad they’ve begun now, not later.

But it does seem too late for the Alberta NDP to do that except in the hoopla of campaign. It’s a big mistake, in my view. As you say, there’s just so much more it could have done—but didn’t—at least not yet.

“… what could Notley possibly do …”

Excellent question but rather than skip over it, lets examine a wee bit.
There will be a future, not too many years hence, in which Alberta has a productive economy. That economy will have very little in common with the economy of the last couple decades. There will be petroleum; there will always be petroleum! But the petro-industry that Kenney and Notley are promising simply will not exist.

It cannot. The whole of the rest of the world is moving away from fossil fuels. Science and just plain reality is telling us, the whole of humanity, that if we don’t stop, cease, quit petroleum use immediately our existing global economy will cease to exist eventually.
So, the petro-industry as we know it is done for.

What then is next? Do we crawl in a hole and eat worms? I think not.
What Notley could possibly do, is begin the conversation and exploration of what a future economy could look like. Regardless of the specifics of future economic prosperity we know there are some general prerequisites, like education, infrastructure, plentiful usable power, safe environments and clean water. There is more than enough in these to keep 4 million Albertan’s occupied.
As to her electoral success, I believe the nod is always going to go to the candidate who is looking ahead to a brighter future than the one who is reaching back to burnish a historic artifact.

Rachel Notley, premier of Alberta, personally popular but leading a New Democratic Party that has trailed its conservative rival in recent polls, called an election this morning. Albertans will go to the polls on April 16, in accordance with the province’s fixed-election-period law bequeathed by the now departed Progressive Conservative Party.

A day after her government’s Throne Speech in the Legislature, Premier Notley chose to make her election announcement in Calgary, which most political observers agree will be the key battleground in the election contest to come.

Premier Notley’s message was one of hope and optimism, but also of stark contrast with the United Conservative Party and its leader, former Harper Government Cabinet minister Jason Kenney, at this moment mired in a string of controversies including the way he secured his 2017 victory as the leader of the UCP, his living expenses as a federal MP, and the kinds of candidates his party attracts, one of whom quit the race last night after being exposed as holding white supremacist views.

Standing before a cheering crowd, diverse in every way, in the National Music Centre in Calgary, streamed on social media throughout the province, Ms. Notley was at her best – charismatic, warm and yet coolly focused.

She asked the crowd, and the province: “Are you ready to fight for an Alberta where we bring people together, not keep them apart?”

She is the story now, the medium through which the hopes of progressive, honest government in Alberta flow.

I don’t know if anyone still quotes Marshall McLuhan, the Edmonton-born philosopher of media who coined the phrase at the top of this story, but to me this was a truly McLuhanesque moment in Canadian politics.

Hopefully, Albertans will be reminded of the reasons why they voted for the NDP in 2015. It appears that the those reasons would remain as equally valid in 2019, if now not more so given Kenney’s blatant lying and backroom cronyism. Albertans need to be reminded at every step of this election period. We didn’t want this culture in 2015, and we certainly don’t need it in 2019!

I was thinking it would be a May election, but mid April is probably better for many people, including students and farmers. It will also hopefully be warm enough for the candidates going door to door. If there should be any law about elections in Alberta, November to March dates should probably be excluded – trying to pound or place those signs into the very frozen snow covered ground seems a bit much. In any event, I expect it will be an exciting campaign and will go quickly – 28 days flies when you are involved with it.

I don’t think people quote McLuhan as much as they used to, but he was very insightful for his time and had a good point. As Albertans we can sort of claim him as our own, proof that thoughtful and forward thinking people can and do come from here. I would suggest in this case the location is also the message. Maybe Kenney was trying to replicate Scheer’s success(?) with the yellow jacket truckers by picking Nisku, or maybe it was convenience to be close to airport to fly off somewhere else, probably to some smaller place where the media can not easily follow him to ask him more pesky questions about illegal campaign donations and all that. He does tend to try disappear at times of controversy, which could make for an interesting approach to campaigning.

“One of the biggest issues will be the question of how much of current revenue from non-renewable resources should be saved and how those savings should be invested … so that, if the day ever comes that oil and gas isn’t as significant as it is now, there’s something to replace it.”


Nothing but denial and belligerence from UCP Leader Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If you thought Rachel Notley, you would be wrong.

The answer is Preston Manning, once upon a time the godfather of the Canadian right. He was speaking back in 2006 in an interview with Canadian Business Magazine.

Later in the same interview, he noted “there is a growing concern about environmental conservation and I think the question is not whether you make a major effort to improve environmental quality and environmental conservation but how is it to be done? Do you rely increasingly on government regulation and intervention or do you rely more on the marketplace?”

In other words, something like the carbon tax Jason Kenney has promised to eliminate in Alberta if he is elected in two weeks and that Andrew Scheer vows to destroy if he becomes prime minister next fall, or the cap-and-trade system in Ontario that Premier Doug Ford has already torn up and tossed away.


Toronto City Councillor Mike Layton (Photo: Twitter).

Mr. Manning has spoken about this a lot over the past 20 years, although for some reason he is awfully quiet lately. He may or may not have seen that the environmental impact of unchecked capitalism threatened the survival of the planet, but he certainly figured out that a deteriorating planetary environment presents an existential threat to capitalism.

He may also have worried that a cynical new generation of Canadian right-wing politicians would not be able to resist picking the low hanging fruit offered by new taxes and higher prices, which are always unpopular at first but are key parts of the market-oriented solutions Mr. Manning had in mind.

Think about it. Mr. Manning was probably in a better position than most of us to know just what people like Messrs. Kenney, Ford and Scheer were thinking.

If Mr. Manning’s musings sounded like blue-sky rambling 13 years ago, you would think it would have a good deal more credibility on the right now in a week when we have been told that Canada’s climate is warming at double the rate of the rest of the world.

Officials from Environment and Climate Change Canada published the results of their research yesterday, and the news was not encouraging. Their report said Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet, northern Canada at almost three times the global rate.


Calgary corporate lawyer Colin Feasby (Photo: Osler law firm).

And remember, this is based on actual observation, not computer models of what might happen in the future – which are easier for climate-change deniers to cast doubt upon.

But instead of a serious attempt to by the right to offer alternative solutions to climate change, we get a clown car of climate change denial and juvenile belligerence like Mr. Kenney’s attack on the modest reforms enacted by the governments of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The UCP leader apparently wants to roll it all back and sue anyone who says anything different. He’s even promised to pull the plug on the NDP’s investment in renewable energy – which might even get him off Mr. Manning’s Christmas card list!

Meanwhile, whatever voters in Alberta decide to do in two weeks, the world is waking up to what’s happening to the planet and looking for solutions. As things grow worse, those solutions will grow more forceful.

Mr. Kenney was taking credit recently for getting Toronto City Council to drop Councillor Mike Layton’s call for Canada’s largest city to explore legal ways to seek compensation for the costs of global climate change from major contributors to global climate change.

This was baloney, of course, since city councillors frequently bring up ideas like this and they’re inevitably kicked to the curb a few times before they become part of the mainstream.


British journalist and environmentalist George Monbiot (Photo: ITV.com).

But you can count on it that this strategy will be back from cities likely to be impacted by global climate change – New York on the Atlantic, and Vancouver on the Pacific, for just two examples. All the “war rooms” in the world aren’t going to make this go away when the waters start to rise and the forests start to burn, as the findings of the Environment Canada report suggest they will soon.

Some go even farther. Last month, journalist George Monbiot published a column in the Guardian calling for the perpetrators of grave environmental harm to be hauled before an international court and charged with ecocide.

Such an approach, Mr. Monbiot wrote, could “do for all life on Earth what the criminalization of genocide has done for vulnerable minorities: provide protection where none existed before.”

This may sound crazy now, but give it another 13 years and see what folks think.

“Climate change is real and denial is not an option for energy industry players or the lawyers who represent them,” wrote Calgary-based corporate lawyer Colin Feasby, Calgary managing partner of the Osler law firm, in December.

“The energy industry is moving quickly on climate change and most sophisticated participants are in favor of market-based policies to reduce emissions,” he explained. “Many enterprises have already accounted for the risk of climate change litigation both in their public disclosure and in the conduct of their business. Some leading industry players have adopted public policy positions that promote the reduction of emissions, such as Exxon’s championing of carbon taxation and Shell’s advocacy of renewable energy solutions.”

Indeed, that’s undoubtedly why Royal Dutch Shell yesterday revealed it is urging Canada’s energy lobby groups to grow up and stop bucking carbon taxes, else it will pull its support and participation.

But what do we get from Mr. Kenney and his modern Canadian Conservative crowd? Denial and childish threats, plus promises to turn back the clock and make the world like it.

That is one approach that is not going to work! You can take that to the bank","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

No worries. Kenney and Schneer have marvellous climate plans that won’t cost anything or involve any government action. They just can’t tell us what’s in them before they are elected.

The 3 minute video from U of Ottawa in the article “A slippery slope: How climate change is reshaping the Arctic landscape” is worth a look. It includes a timelapse of a slump in action (18 days in 13 seconds).

I believe that one of the challenges for some right wing political groups is the focus that a minority of their members place on conservative social issues. It turns many people off. In some instances it can tear a right wing political party apart. Just think back to how the social conservatives in the former Wild Rose Party undermined Danielle Smith.

Kenney is currently challenges with the acceptability of some of his socially far right candidates. If elected, I believe that Kenney will has many challenges within his party over this issue as he will have with the Opposition. His challenge is simple. His UCP party membership has a much higher percentage of social conservatives than does the province as a whole. Most especially the key area of Edmonton and Calgary.

I have always wondered about some of the old comments Mr. Manning made, they sounded nice perhaps even sincere and thoughtful, beyond the usual Conservative lip service to the environment which is yes, we love it, but no we won’t really do anything about it except talk a lot about vague plans that never seem to accomplish anything. Perhaps Mr. Manning was wearing his statesman’s hat at the time he said them, which fit him well given his position, before he decided he still wanted to be a political operative again, which hasn’t worked out so well for him at times. In any event it does illustrate the current dilemma for Conservatives. As voters become increasingly concerned about the environment, all Conservatives can seem to do is double down in their fight against the carbon tax. We know what they are against, but what is not so clear is what they are for.

I suppose they hope the fight against the carbon tax will score them some cheap political points in the short term and perhaps they just can’t stand agreeing with the Liberals and the NDP, even though some of the earliest advocates of a carbon tax were conservatives like Mr. Manning. Those advocates rightly pointed out it is a more efficient way to provide an incentive to reduce energy use and rather than forcing choices on consumers, it allows them the flexibility to make their own choices as to how they get there. It is also the most direct and transparent approach. I am yet not sure what scheme the Federal Conservatives and the UCP will come up with to reduce carbon use, it will probably be a hidden indirect tax that is not as effective, but perhaps easier to sell politically as consumers are not as aware they are paying more. Maybe they will beat the miracle carbon capture nearly dead horse (or should I say unicorn) once again, the one Alberta’s previous government spent 2 billion dollars on with not much to show – technically feasible perhaps, economically not so much. The Federal Conservatives have been talking about their soon to be announced plan for almost a year now, with an election soon approaching they still seem to have nothing. Here in Alberta where we are already having an election, the UCP seems to now finally have a bunch of policies on other things, but a clear solid alternative carbon reduction plan, not so much.

Maybe Mr. Manning should go back to being a statesman for now. At some point the ridiculousness of Scheer and Kenney’s climate change plans (or lack thereof) will become even more obvious and the Conservatives may become completely discredited on this issue. At that time, their only option may to be to dust off Mr. Manning’s old statements and pretend the whole Scheer/Ford/Kenney anti-carbon tax crusade did not happen.

The conservative approach is puzzling, but if you grant that reality is what you believe it is, things become much clearer. I think that what we’re seeing here is a regressive slide on the part of the right, to the acceptance of an ideology-based approach to, not only political issues, but science, art, and for all I know engineering. Facts are accepted or rejected according to whether or not the support the ideology.
This might sound like the triumphant discovery of the obvious to many who post here, but it still stonkers me. How can a political side that, forty years ago, was conceded to be realists even by their political opponents, become such ardent post-modernists?

Justin Trudeau’s recently applied federal carbon tax in 4 provinces will according to the Liberal’s rebate consumers more money than they spend in carbon tax. If I said to you that I would rebate all the taxes you payed on cigarettes would this inspire you to quit?

One problem I have with a carbon tax is it is supposed to inspire us to use a less C02 emitting alternative. Look at heating your house. A gigajoule of natural gas delivered to my house costs $5.46 + $1.517 of carbon tax at the present $30 a tonne rate for a total of $6.98 per gigajoule. A gigajoule of natural gas is the equivelent amount of energy as 277 kwh of electricity. If you average my electrical bill over the year I pay just over $.19 a kwh. So for me to purchase the equivelent energy of 1 gigajoule of natural gas as electricity would cost me $52.63. A cost increase of over 750%. Does this sound feasible? I am certainly all for energy efficiency but unless you can produce and deliver electricity to my house for around 3 cents a kwh there really is no alternative in Alberta to heating with natural gas. Enjoy your day.

215,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Rachel Notley and Jason Kenney escape relatively unscathed in Alberta election leaders’ debate,2019-04-05 02:04:00,David Climenhaga,,"Last night’s Alberta election leaders’ debate was an unedifying experience, as these things often are.

If anyone except hard-core political junkies kept their hands off the remote, I’d be surprised.


CTV Calgary broadcaster Tara Nelson, moderator of last night’s leaders’ debate (Photo: Twitter).

Debate stuck to talking points we’ve heard before, the broadcast aired at a weird hour when many viewers were still coming home from work, the format made the discussion difficult to follow, moderator Tara Nelson often shouted over participants as she struggled to maintain order, and the panel of four journos asked pedestrian questions. It was cacophonous and irritating.

Worse, there were no epic body slams in which one debater got smashed to the mat by another one, no “math is hard” moment as in 2015. And, let’s admit it, that’s what we’re all hoping for when we sit down to watch one of these things.

The lack of a decisive moment in this debate may be a good thing for the leaders of the two major parties, Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat, and Opposition Leader Jason Kenney of the United Conservative Party. No one enjoyed a knockout, but no one got knocked out either. Supporters of both parties can call their leader the winner, and will.

Ms. Notley and Mr. Kenney used strong language to emphasize key points of their campaigns.

Ms. Notley called Mr. Kenney an electoral cheat surrounded by extremist candidates, weak on the environment and health care, and a flop on the pipeline file the whole time he was in Ottawa.

Mr. Kenney called Ms. Notley a tax-and-spend politician, too close to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, ineffective on job creation, and a flop on the pipeline file the whole time she’s been premier.

Ms. Notley sounded as if she was battling a cold. Mr. Kenney sounded as if he were aiming for glib piety and falling short, like a driver with a guilty secret in the trunk trying to talk his way out of a late-night traffic stop.

Whenever either one of them tried to respond to a jab, it seemed as if Ms. Nelson interrupted and asked someone else to speak.

The closest thing to a memorable moment came in the low-stakes side battle between Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel and Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan as they fought it out for a distant third place.

Mr. Khan, a lawyer, accused the Alberta Party of being in favour of privatized medicine. He said he heard it in the radio. Mr. Mandel denied it and said Mr. Khan must have been “smoking things that you shouldn’t have been smoking.”

This was mildly entertaining, but not exactly the stuff of high political drama.

Despite having to deflect a few shots for his past record as a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, Mr. Mandel, a former mayor of Edmonton, was relaxed and in control as only someone can be who knows the stakes are just incredibly low. Everyone else has more to lose, arguably, in the April 16 election, which is presumably why they seemed more edgy.

Maybe what this debate needed was a shot of Derek Fildebrandt, who never should have been shut out on the spurious grounds used to eliminate him – that his Freedom Conservative Party didn’t run any candidates in 2015. (Note to the “media consortium” that cooked up this single 2019 TV debate: neither did the United Conservative Party.)

Impact? I’d say relatively little.

Pity. There really should be a second debate before we all troop to the polls.

I suppose the debate might have been useful for undecided voters just tuning into the election. At times most of the various leaders did somewhat articulate some of their positions. Yes, the start time was odd and at times it was hard to follow what was being said as the speakers were often being cut off in midstream or being talked over. The format or imoderation of it was not the best.

I doubt this was ever going to have a knock out moment, both Mr. Kenney and Premier Notley are very expwrienced speakers. It did give a chance, maybe the only one, for both the Albera Party and Alberta Liberals to get their messages across and both came across as capable. There was a bit of a secondary battle between Mr. Khan and Mr. Mandel. I think Mr. Mandel may have had the advantage, as he can better appeal to fiscal Conservatives tired of the UCP’s apparent obsession with social conservative issues and their various leadership vote scandals. Mandel also came across as wiser and cooler headed in comparison to Kenney who often pushed emotional hot buttons a bit too much.

I don’t think there was any clear winner and didn’t expect there to be. I think the rest of the election campaign will be a gruelling one and the result will come down to the efforts made in the rest of the campaign. In this regard it reminds me of another provincial campaign not so long ago, but not the 2015 one in which the debate did matter more. It is too bad Mr. Fildebrandt was not there, he would have probably made it a much more interesting debate.

Using a hockey analogy, they played to a 3-3 tie in a sloppy, scrappy contest. It would have been more satisfying if they had overtime to decide a winner, if only to satisfy the blood lust of one side or the other.

If you’re scoring this snooze-fest, give the media panel a big fat “F” for frustration.

Spot on remark Mr. Climenhaga about the journalists and their tepid, perfunctory questioning. No one was prepared to challenge Jason Kenney on his party’s insidious leadership campaign or the plethora of ongoing UCP bozo eruptions that have marred his party since the day of its founding convention. And…where was the Edmonton/Calgary Star? Yes, as polarizing as he is, Derek Fildebrandt should have been invited to participate.

The format was something from the past. In our post-modern world we should have seen more time on each policy subject. To me it seemed they were all (yes even master Jason Kenney) vying for the middle. That mushy mess that has produced a province that could a’ should’a’, but didn’t! Yes! We’ve pissed it all away! Not once, not twice, but three times thanks to “conservative” dogma! Now what? More conservative dogma? I’m too old, but my children don’t deserve this! Bury me in the slag piles of Sudbury! I admit to being a mining engineer! I don’t admit to being stupid! Vote NDP! Vote Notely!

Pretty boring show considering all the material available, yes should have invited Derek Fildebrandt.

So they are all going to build pipelines, Kenney didn’t get any built in his time in Ottawa, Notley hasn’t build any in her time as premier, Khan has actually built a pipeline but it was just a summer job, and Mandel forgot his bow tie. Did I miss anything important?

I agree a second debate is needed, if for no other reason than Mandel can find his bow tie. It’s like Churchill without a cigar, Lincoln without his hat, or Stockwell without his wet suit. It just seems unnatural, okay maybe not the last one.

Alberta population growth plus inflation is expected to be 3 .5% in 2018-19. That’s 14% by 2023. Kenney says he can cap the budget and hand out big tax cuts without cutting services. His plan to do this? Hire consultants to do audits.

I wish one of the candidates had called him on this. Math is hard.

I agree with David C and the others about the effect of this debate on the outcome of the election. Rachel did her best to make the distinctions between Kenney and herself while Kenney managed to do well enough to not sound very extreme – even though there are many positions in the UCP that seem pretty extreme. The strategy from here is to see which base is more motivated, the UCP or the NDP. The other leaders did okay but they probably didn’t win many new voters. Their parties won’t make much of a difference on this election and it will be interesting to see what their future is.

“Cacophonous?” “Talking over each other?” Really?

Coming from BC where leaders’ debates usually consist of each “debater” grinding their mouths into gear and flooring it for the entire torture session, I found this Alberta exercise as orderly as a debaters’ club of the high school variety—that is, respectful, bloodless, toothless and fairly dull. You can’t do that in BC else you blow a 20-point lead and default to a lousier, if louder, contestant.

Political audiences usually want interruptions to their mostly non political lives to be rewarded with some blood and teeth on the floor—it hardly matters whose. Incoherence hardly matters when utterances made while strapped to a stretcher are drowned out by the din of applause. Politicians on campaign must parry or lose.

One had to look and listen pretty closely to discover anything approaching a knock-out punch during the debate—although Ms Notley almost tangled KeKKenney up in a tried and true combo: she took exception to KeKKenney’s gross exaggeration of her taxation plank—but he didn’t take the bait and might have tricked her into a “math is hard” rejoinder; but she was too smart for that. Neither was there a “Deplorables” moment. No points scored, either way.

Of course Mr Fildebrandt should have been there: he could have been the ‘F’ to KeKKenney’s ‘U.’

213,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,An election’s coming and the PM’s treading water – where’s a Russian to blame now that we need one,2019-04-07 01:20:00,David Climenhaga,,"It was a year ago Friday that the government of Canada declared Kirill Kalinin and three other Russian diplomats persona non grata and sent them packing for using, in the words of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “their diplomatic status to undermine Canada’s security or interfere in our democracy.”

Nobody bothered to commemorate the expulsion on the anniversary except the former First Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Canada himself.


Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

With Jody Wilson-Reybould, Jane Philpott, and Mr. Trudeau’s troubles to write about, the Ottawa Press Gallery had bigger fish to fry than bothering to rehash the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats from Western countries in response to the poisonings of Russian expatriate Sergei Skripal and his visiting daughter Yulia in the U.K., which remain unsolved and controversial.

However, Mr. Kalinin reposted a couple of year-old Canadian news stories about his expulsion on his Facebook page from Moscow, where he now mans the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Canada Desk.

If you’re a Canadian diplomat in Russia, I guess Mr. Kalinin is now the guy you have to call if you want to get anything approved. That must be awkward!

Mr. Kalinin got into trouble in Canada because he turned out to be a deft hand at social media and tweeted, among many things, an embarrassing factoid about Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s family history, the fact her Ukrainian grandfather Michael Chomiak collaborated with the Nazis in Eastern Europe during World War II.

This may have been what Mr. Trudeau had in mind when he said last year that the interference in our democracy took the form of “efforts by Russian propagandists to discredit our Minister of Foreign Affairs in various ways through social media and by sharing scurrilous stories about her.”

The trouble was, as David Pugliese of the National Post observed, the scurrilous story was true. “It soon became clear that Chomiak had indeed worked with the Nazis, editing an anti-Semitic newspaper in Poland,” Mr. Pugliese wrote. “Photos showed him partying with senior Nazi leaders and files from the newspaper revealed pro-Nazi propaganda and cartoons aimed at denigrating Jews.”

Since Postmedia is something like present-day Canada’s equivalent of Soviet-era official newspapers Izvestia and Pravda combined, this officially makes Mr. Pugliese’s report both the news and the truth, does it not?


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Reybould as portrayed by an anonymous Edmonton street artist (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Regardless, perhaps the reappearance of last year’s stories reminded the beleaguered Trudeaucrats in Ottawa – facing a more difficult fall election than they’d anticipated at this time last year thanks to their own ineptitude – that sometimes it’s handy to have someone like Mr. Kalinin nearby to kick around.

“Our judgment is interference is very likely and we think there has probably already been efforts by malign foreign actors to disrupt our democracy,” Ms. Freeland told a meeting in France of foreign ministers from the nations with the world’s seven largest “advanced” economies, also on Friday.

Of course, if the Liberals manage to lose this fall’s election to a hapless goof like Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer with or without Mr. Trudeau at the helm, it will be pretty hard to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Mr. Kalinin, or any of the other usual Russian suspects for the debacle.

No, it’ll be obvious that this time the Liberals managed to mess things up all by their own sweet selves.

Well, Ms. Freeland – who might very well be a leading candidate to replace Mr. Trudeau if it comes to that – accomplished one thing by kicking Mr. Kalinin out of the country. The Russian Embassy’s social media efforts have pretty well gone to hell in a handbasket since he departed.

This puts paid to the theory last year’s brouhaha was ginned up by an robotic army of Russian trolls using Huawei G5 routers, or whatever, if you ask me.

Just the same, Ms. Freeland also suggested such efforts aren’t just about getting a particular party or candidate to win. “The effort is to make our societies more polarized and to make us, as citizens of democracies, more cynical about the very idea that democracy exists and that it can work.”

OK, but it seems to me that the Conservative Party of Canada and its provincial chapters, not Moscow, are the ones doing the heavy lifting on that front.

Regardless of that, Ms. Freeland assured her G7 counterparts the government is setting up a “critical election protocol,” including five powerful Ottawa mandarins, to decide if any foreign interference in October’s federal election is serious enough to alert the public in mid-campaign. (This would not include, presumably, influence by paid electoral consultants and contractors from the foreign republic immediately south of the 49th Parallel.)

<p class=""p1"">OK, but it seems to me that the Conservative Party of Canada and its provincial chapters, not Moscow, are the ones doing the heavy lifting on that front.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Regardless of that, Ms. Freeland assured her G7 counterparts the government is setting up a “critical election protocol,” including five powerful Ottawa mandarins, to decide if any foreign interference in October’s federal election is serious enough to alert the public in mid-campaign.

I assume she will be on a plane from there to a Lima group meeting to see how Guaido is doing, no interference there of course. May need some humanitarian bombing in time for the election to show how tough the Liberals are?

Perhaps if Kenney isn’t too busy trying to extinguish the lake of fire he can help out as the government he was part of did such an excellent job in Libya.

Do they think the Canadian public is that stupid to not see through this crap?

An even bigger scandal was Canada’s participation in the NATO bombing campaign in 2011 which helped overthrow Ghaddafi in Libya, in effect bringing to end one of the few prosperous stable countries in Africa and turning it into a chaotic mess. The latest news out of Libya now is that it’s on the verge of a full blown civil war.

We don’t mind so much when we spread death and destruction in distant lands. But when we find out our business people are paying bribes everyone is like OMG!

Freeland is pro-fascist as exemplified by Canada’s stance on insurgencies in the Ukraine, Brazil, and Venezuela. Anything that’s Right is right. Anything that’s Left is wrong.
If the combined incompetence of Trudeau and Singh result in Scheer as PM and Freeland as Liberal leader, God help us all.

I think freedom of the press was rather low on the Nazi’s list of priorities, so if you were in occupied Poland you probably had three choices, get out, play nice with them or die. I suppose we can be critical of Mr. Chomiak, but that was the world he faced, a much more difficult one than we do, so should we be judging him too harshly and what really does this have to do with his granddaughter?

I suppose memories in Europe are long and World War II was both traumatic and a great victory for the Soviet Union, but it no longer exists. Perhaps it would be better now to look to the future than dwell on the ills of the past.

Canada as a young country is perhaps freer of these historical conlicts and how they can keep nations mired in an unproductive reliving of the past, but we have our own recurring conflicts and problems. One is the upcoming election grudge match between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

Last time much to their chagrin “just not ready” did not work as well for the Conservatived as their character assasination of the two previous Liberal leaders. Therefore you might think they would try something else this time, but they seem to be doubling down with “we told you so”.

Maybe it will work or maybe not, but I suppose if they make the election about Trudeau’s character, it might distract the voters away from say their lack of a climate change strategy or some of their other quetionable policies. It is a distraction worthy of Trump or Putin. I wonder if they will also start going on about Nazi sympathizers in the PM’s family past. I wouldn’t be surprised if they did.

“Of course, if the Liberals manage to lose this fall’s election to a hapless goof like Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer with or without Mr. Trudeau at the helm, it will be pretty hard to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Mr. Kalinin, or any of the other usual Russian suspects for the debacle.”

There seemed to be something to wind everyone up as we enter the final stretch of a provincial election both sides have characterized as an epochal event sure to seal the fate of the province if it goes the wrong way.

This may have been only the anger-magnifying tendency of social media, or the “friends” and “followers” I have accumulated over the years, but I can’t ever recall seeing so many people on both sides of a political division so wound up.


Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

There is a fringe of the Alberta right that has always been furious about pretty well everything, of course. They were enraged by the NDP’s surprise victory in May 2015 and they have been enraged about it ever since. Their fury was ratcheted up even more when Premier Rachel Notley didn’t just roll over and concede victory to the Opposition but fought back with an aggressive campaign of her own.

Still, most Albertans have been capable over the years of engaging in civil discourse when it comes to politics. This was not so evident last night, with only four more sleeps till voting day. The proximate cause, I think, was two things:
One is the sense among supporters of the NDP Government that weeks of bozo eruptions by United Conservative Party candidates and evidence of sketchy ethical practices and possibly outright illegalities by UCP activists associated with Leader Jason Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign have had little impact on the Opposition party’s strong lead in public opinion.

The other was the news story yesterday that RCMP officers with a search warrant had swooped in late Thursday on the Calgary auto-repair business of Peter Singh, the UCP’s candidate in Calgary-East, and removed a computer hard drive, “other electronic devices,” and a suitcase.


Screenshot of CTV broadcast of police inside Mr. Singh’s business.

The Mounties were tight lipped about the nature of the investigation. Mr. Singh, apparently, was nowhere to be found, although he said in a written statement the police had returned his computer. When a reporter tried to question Mr. Kenney about it, an aide pushed the door shut in her face. The details are murky. Conspiracy theories abound, especially on the right.

Last year the Calgary Herald reported allegations Mr. Singh “used at least one local resident’s credit card to advance his nomination campaign.”

According to the CBC, the UCP had earlier investigated allegations of bribery and fraud related to Mr. Singh’s nomination, but found no proof and cleared him.

Meanwhile, advance polls have been setting records. With well over 400,000 votes cast, turnout has been significantly higher in the first three days of advance polling than in all advance polls in 2015, when 162,000 advance ballots were cast. About 2.6 million Albertans are registered to vote. Today is the last day for advance polling.

Political scientists say this may not mean much – it’s easier this time to cast an advance ballot, thanks to new voting rules. But it is one more factor winding politically engaged Albertans up.

I suspect this is a sign of things to come, and not just in Alberta. We have already seen like things happen in the United States, driven by the Trump Republicans but embraced by their Democratic Party rivals.

Since anger and an appeal to the worst instincts of the base worked for the Republicans, you can count on it that their Conservative brethren in Alberta and Canada are not just paying close attention, but dealing with the same consultants.

Political parties on the centre and left, such as there is a left in Canada any more, will have no choice but to respond in kind, and so they will.

Indeed, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, anxious to recover from his own self-inflicted political wounds, appeared to be testing an aggressive campaign strategy of his own on Thursday, lumping federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in with alt-right conspiracy theorists, racists and religious bigots","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

It is a sad day when when you can’t even talk politics without the threat of physical violence which unfortunately is where we are headed or already at. I would have liked to see the NDP concentrate more on the economy and let Kenney’s personal record and character speak for itself. From his humble beginnings as a Saskatchewan Liberal to his transition as a hero of the social conservatives it’s all been out there for quite a long time.

Why didn’t they compare his talk on deficits with the facts of the numbers racked up by governments he was a part of? They took Canada from a $10 Billion surplus to a $60 billion deficit in 2 years. So tough economic times only require government to run deficits when it’s a conservative government? We know that the “surplus” in Harper’s final year was an accounting trick. Check how the $2 billion in GM stock was accounted for on that one.

Personally I hope Albertans don’t hand any party a majority government, make them work together. It will be a terrible thing if we degrade into out right tribalism as they have south of the border.

A sentence or two containing the words “RCMP raid … UCP candidate and fraudulent voting” has got to be one of the worst nightmares for the UCP just days before the election. Will this become the straw that breaks the camels back? It might.

Allegations of questionable candidate statements and behavior have been piling up even before the election was called. In fact, the day before the election was called I believe there was a story about the illegal donations side of the kamikaze candidate story. Perhaps then it is fitting the campaign ends on a similar note. According to polls, if you believe them, the UCP has maintained a lead throughout, but that lead according to several polls has diminished considerably. I get the sense some UCP supporters already have had some reservations from all the previous bad headlines about UCP behavior. It wouldn’t be surprising if some of those with such reservations will either vote for another party or stay at home.

I have the sense this election will be closer than is being predicted in most polls and I think turn out may be crucial to what the end outcome will be. It is very interesting there is a high turnout at advance polls this time. It may in part be due to the more flexible rules around where one can vote in advance polls, but perhaps there may be more to it than that.

The high voter turnout at advanced polls is certainly interesting. Myself I voted yesterday because I had time. Tuesday , right now looks like a busy day for me, so it was purely convenience. As for Justin Trudeau attacking supporters of Scheer and calling them racists and religious bigots, does anybody really believe this improves your support? Look at his proposed changes to the asylum laws that were included in the Liberal’s new budget bill. The conservatives have been pressing the Liberal’s on this issue ever since Trudeau’s welcome to Canada tweet. He has been calling the conservatives racist all along on the border issue and then he quietly hides changes in the budget bill. Name calling just hides a lack of true intelligence and policy. Enjoy your day.

Not sure if anger and an appeal to base instincts has “worked” for the Republicans. Their candidate didn’t win the popular vote—probably by cheating, too—a significant proportion of tRump voters were actually voting against Hillary, and some unknown (unconfessed) proportion expected Trump would switch from campaign to presidential mode if he won; tRump has destroyed his own Republican Party with demagoguery.

No doubt the Canadian neo-right has adopted tRump-style demagoguery—but only because nothing else has been “working” for them. Soon we’ll see if it “works” just as well for the UCP as it has for the Republicans.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Premier-elect Jason Kenney has made it unequivocally clear there will be no more provincial carbon tax as quickly as legislatively possible, and he and the other boys from the cover of Maclean’s Magazine will do whatever they can to sink the federal carbon tax too, insofar as it applies to the provinces.

For places like British Columbia and Quebec, that will make opposing Mr. Kenney on the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project synonymous with opposing alt-right environmental conspiracy theories and full-blown climate change denial.

So it’s not necessarily a bad thing for the governments of either of those provinces if an argument over economics turns into an all-out culture war. With Mr. Kenney’s face on the TMX, what are the chances fence-sitting British Columbians in particular will flee in droves to the anti-pipeline camp? Pretty good, I’d say.

What Will Rachel Do?


Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley on Tuesday Night (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As noted here Tuesday night, sticking around as Opposition leader isn’t going to be all that much fun for soon-to-be-former Premier Rachel Notley.


Environmentalist and author Avi Lewis (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Ms. Notley is not a flake. So there was no Jim Prentice-style tantrum the instant the election results were in, but she’s got to be thinking about her future, not to mention the future ability of the NDP to form a government in a province as solidly cap-C Conservative as Alberta now is, especially without a wild rose bush in sight.

Already, some people in political Alberta are whispering about the idea of Ms. Notley resigning in time to run for the New Democratic Party in the federal Edmonton Strathcona riding, which occupies much of the same territory as her provincial riding that’s only a hyphen away from having the same name. Yes, Heather McPherson, the current nominated candidate would have to step aside, but stranger things have happened.


Edmonton Strathcona federal NDP candidate Heather McPherson (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

That could set Ms. Notley up for two epic battles: First, perhaps, with Avi Lewis or someone like him from the Leap wing of the federal NDP for the soul of the national party, and after that, if the planets were all in alignment, for a rematch Rumble on the Rideau with Jason Kenney to replace the increasingly rudderless Mr. Trudeau.

Likely? Probably not. But it’s fun to think about.

The next logical move for PMJT would be …

Speaking of Mr. Trudeau, if he were smart, he’d cancel the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project right now.

Why? The Art of the Deal, of course.

With Jason Kenney about to be sworn in as the Big Kahuna in Edmonton vowing that his Bill 1 will be the Carbon Tax Repeal Act, that would be your ultimate, no foolin’ around federal bargaining chip, don’t you think?

And it would be popular in certain parts of Canada that are important to Mr. Trudeau’s re-election hopes.

Fortunately for Mr. Kenney, evidence is mounting Mr. Trudeau isn’t all that smart, or at least that he’s lost his mojo since Gerald Butts took the high jump.

This just in from the press room


Calgary Sun-Herald Columnist Rick Bell (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

While other Postmedia columnists were rejoicing about the UCP victory – as well they should, most of them have devoted themselves to task of ensuring it happened every day for the past four years – Rick Bell still found time to whine about how the NDP treated him.

“Long before Jason Kenney came along, this scribbler who crusaded against the corruption and abuses of Toryland and wrote about Notley’s rise before others, became an unperson in the Notley NDP world,” Mr. Bell whinged.

Chin up, Dinger! Time to stop choking back the tears. It’s not all about you. We were all unpersons!

So long, Alberta Party! Just go away


Former Alberta Party leader and MLA Greg Clark, swept away in the UCP wave on Tuesday night (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Born of the “Big Listen,” a province-wide kaffeeklatsch, the Alberta Party started out as a home for disgruntled Blue Liberals a decade ago.

When the smart ones all got elected as city councillors in Calgary and Edmonton, it morphed into a post-UCP home for disgruntled Red Tories.

Under the leadership of Greg Clark the Alberta Party managed to shuffle unconvincingly along through the Notley Years in the Alberta Legislature, even attracting a disgruntled New Democrat MLA and a disgruntled UCP MLA to its caucus.

But then Stephen Mandel, the bored and cranky former mayor of Edmonton and sometime Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, got the idea of duplicating Mr. Kenney’s double-reverse-hostile takeover of the PC Party and the Wildrose Party, which had resulted in the UCP.

If only … Mr. Mandel seemed to think. On Tuesday, the political party that never, ever captured the imagination of Albertans despite having a great name, was totally skunked. Of the full slate of 87 candidates it ran, none were elected, and that included Mr. Mandel.

Seventies pop icon Debbie Harry had the right advice for the Alberta Party at this point in its history: “Don’t go away sad. Don’t go away mad. Just go away!”

How’s that Kenney schtick goin’ down in Quebec?


Greetings from Quebec, Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Message from the National Assembly in Quebec City: Congratulations, Jason Kenney! Now get lost!

Yesterday the National Assembly considered a motion by the Québec solidaire political party that congratulated Mr. Kenney for his victory Tuesday, and added: “Qu’elle rappelle que le Québec a la pleine légitimité de refuser des projets d’oléoducs.”

That basically means, in the event like me you’re condemned to speak only English, that just in case you forgot, Quebec reminds Albertans it has the legitimate right to refuse pipeline projects.

The party elaborated further in a Facebook post: “Merci, mais non merci.”

The motion was passed unanimously by the Assembly.

<p class=""p1"">Ms. Notley is not a flake. So there was no Jim Prentice-style tantrum the instant the election results were in, but she’s got to be thinking about her future, not to mention the future ability of the NDP to form a government in a province as solidly cap-C Conservative as Alberta now is, especially without a wild rose bush in sight.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Already, some people in political Alberta are whispering about the idea of Ms. Notley resigning in time to run for the New Democratic Party in the federal Edmonton Strathcona riding, which occupies much of the same territory as her provincial riding that’s only a hyphen away from having the same name. Yes, Heather McPherson, the current nominated candidate would have to step aside, but stranger things have happened.</p>

<p class=""p1"">That could set Ms. Notley up for two epic battles: First, perhaps, with Avi Lewis or someone like him from the Leap wing of the federal NDP for the soul of the national party, and after that, if the planets were all in alignment, for a rematch Rumble on the Rideau with Jason Kenney to replace the increasingly rudderless Mr. Trudeau.</p>

<p class=""p1"">With Jason Kenney about to be sworn in as the Big Kahuna in Edmonton vowing that his Bill 1 will be the Carbon Tax Repeal Act, that would be your ultimate, no foolin’ around federal bargaining chip, don’t you think?</p>
<p class=""p1"">And it would be popular in <i>certain parts</i> of Canada that are important to Mr. Trudeau’s re-election hopes.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fortunately for Mr. Kenney, evidence is mounting Mr. Trudeau isn’t all that smart, or at least that he’s lost his mojo since Gerald Butts took the high jump.</p>

A lot of political baggage to unpack and Mr. Kenney has not even settled in yet. In theory, Mr. Kenney could be a succesful long term Conservative Premier of a Conservative leaning Province, sort of the Jean Charest of the far right, but I sense he has bigger ambitions than just remaining a big fish in a small pond. As a result he will take us all on a crazy ride and we will probably end up a bit nauseous from it. After a few years of his probably unsucessful battles with other Canadian governments, courts and environmentalists, Notley’s approach might look quite good in hindsight. She might be wise to stick around until Alberta catches up to her strategy. In any event she is probably still the best asset the Alberta NDP has or may ever have.

Trudeau is now playing to a national audience, Kenney currently more to a local one. If Trudeau looks reasonable while Kenney doesn’t that could benefit Trudeau over the Federal Conservatives. They may actually only have one common interest, they both don’t want Scheer to win the Federal election in October, but for different reasons. Scheer’s success would probably keep Kenney’s political ambitions forever confined to the provincial pond he now swims in.

I don’t know if the Alberta Party will fade away just yet, but Mr. Mandel probably will.
Can he read the writing on the wall that now says retirement in big flashing letters? I like Mandel, but I thought from the start the Alberta Party made a mistake in choosing him as leader even though he actually did ok in the debate. Mr. Kenney can also breathe a sigh of relief, no imminent threat from the center right. The disappearance of the Alberta Party might also make a potential future come back easier for the NDP if people eventually tire of Kenney’s antics.

“… I thought from the start the Alberta Party made a mistake in choosing him as leader…”

I agree. The best case scenario for the Alberta Party was they build a substantial beachhead in 2019 and become a government in 2023. A premier Mandel elected in 2023 would turn 80 before the completion of his first term. Sorry to be ageist, but once someone approaches that age you just can’t take for granted he will still have the necessary health and energy the job requires.

One thing I’ve never seen mentioned: Kenney’s never been a leader, only a second (or third) banana in politics. He was good at taking orders from Harper, but he’s yet to be the one with his hand on the tiller (to be fair, you can say that about a lot of political leaders who’ve won a first mandate). We’ll see how he does actually running a ship where he’s declared a red alert and called for all hands on deck.

Re Rachel Notley: Leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition isn’t such a bad job, especially if you are leading the second largest caucus in Alberta NDP history, and have such fat targets on the government side to take potshots at. It’s also a cool title. Who knows, she might just stick it out for a couple or three years, and see whether the NDP has a shot at winning government again in 2023, before deciding her future.

As for the Alberta Party, they did grow their popular vote share significantly from previous elections—they got many more votes than the moribund Alberta Liberals—but it was too distributed to earn them any seats. They should probably keep chipping away at gaining traction, perhaps by refocusing on areas where they have a hope of electing MLAs, but Mr Mandel should probably ease his way into a serene retirement. As for the Liberals, they are nought but a fringe party now and should just fold up their tent.

Sir, you have just hit on one of the most significant points of this whole discussion: that Mr Trudeau stands to piss off far more voters, in far more politically relevant parts of the country, by backing pipelines than he does by opposing them. His re-election chances are not affected one whit by the potential loss of his remaining Alberta rump of four seats, but seriously jeopardized by the possible loss of seats in Greater Vancouver & the Lower Mainland. Scheer is in just as much trouble, since much of his party’s strength is concentrated in Alberta & Saskatchewan, and less so in the all-important electoral theatres of Quebec, Ontario, and BC.

There is an interesting parallel that has been created between the Edmonton/Alberta and Alberta/Canada relationships. If Jason Kenney decides to punish Edmonton for not voting UPC, he can hardly criticize the federal government for punishing Alberta for not voting Liberal. During the election campaign Mr. Kenney argued that Edmonton should vote UPC so they could have a voice at his cabinet table. Using that logic, if the polls suggest we will get a federal Liberal government in the fall, Mr. Kenney should suggest Alberta elect a Liberal MP or two.

I am sure consistency is often overlooked in politics. If you can believe Kenney, he does not seem to be taking the losses in Edmonton too personally. Perhaps that is the case, after all he has enough MLA’s, more might just cause problems. He spent some time in Edmonton where he started his career, so perhaps he also has some favorable memories. In any event, he wasn’t ever the mayor of the other major city in Alberta, but a Federal MP, so he probably wasn’t too caught up in the sometime inter city rivalries, like say another Premier from the 90’s. I don’t think he will do much to benefit or help Edmonton, but perhaps he will refrain from excessive punishment.

Interesting. As a federal politician, Kenney’s default mode was a Trump-like nastiness toward his critics. I’ve always said, Albertans will be shocked when he directs that venom toward the home-front. He is like a junk-yard dog; fine when he’s far away guarding the property, but disruptive when you bring him in the house to play with the children.

When Ms. Notley was elected, I would have been delighted to learn that she would eventually be leading the NDP to victory in a national election. But, as capable as I consider her to be, and as apparently likeable, I have since come to see her as more of a third-way candidate than a visionary, more at home in Blairite Labour than a Corbynite one.

First there was all the sound and fury of the Royalty review, then the galling climbdown of its result. Then the Kenney-lite bashing of BC fruit growers and wine makers. Some nation building that was. Then the character assassination of climate voices, and then of pretty much anyone opposed to more investment / subsidy for carbon-intensive infrastructure. As if $30 a barrel tax on carbon consumption (and not production) can buy us a climate indulgence from the God of Thermodynamics.

Having respected her as I once did, I will not say this was cynicism at work, or opportunism. Opportunism would have meant taking the lottery win of an NDP victory in Alberta and showing how different an NDP government could be, for that term and that mandate. As opposed to investing in the Alberta NDP as a long-term, middle-of-the-road option, doing pretty much what the Right does on the big files, while trying to minimize social spending in an unchallenged low-royalty, low-tax, low-revenue status quo.

In the end, though they governed more skillfully than the Alberta Conservatives have or will since Lougheed, they got what they had coming.

Really important point. Given the hurdles and headwinds against truly social democratic parties in North America, any NDP government should make hay while the sun shines. Given recent history showing that, in most jurisdictions, an NDP government will govern for one-term, they should make that one-term count by passing policy that is in-line with their political philosophy. Sure, it’ll piss off a lot of people. But Notley tried to appease conservatives and look where it got her.

I think the oil companies are praying Kenney doesn’t barge into the china shop and smash the careful structure Notley erected—climate policy, rail cars, Trans Mountain, upgrading, etc.—just when they seem close to paying off. Also, they’re deluded if they think there’s much “red tape” and “fat” left to be trimmed after decades of efforts to do so. The massive reclamation liabilities are one result of too much cutting and accommodation.

Is it nuts to remain optimistic in the age of Ford, Trump, Kenney et al? Interesting etymology: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/03/23/same/

Climenhaga: “With Mr. Kenney’s face on the TMX, what are the chances fence-sitting British Columbians in particular will flee in droves to the anti-pipeline camp?”

Notley’s signal achievement was to “push country-wide support for pipelines from 40% to 70%.” Something Kenney could never do.
Notley led progressives astray to support oilsands and pipelines, downplay the science, and ignore IPCC warnings. Again, something Jason Kenney cannot do.
Kenneys’ aggressive tactics and angry bluster will just increase resistance. His efforts will come to nothing.

Climenhaga: “Already, some people in political Alberta are whispering about the idea of Ms. Notley resigning in time to run for the New Democratic Party in the federal Edmonton Strathcona riding ”

Will an anti-pipeline federal NDP unsparing in its criticism of AB’s oilsands industry welcome the Pipeline Queen into their ranks?

I’m guessing that Kenney’s Bill#1 to abolish the carbon tax will not include enactment of the UCP climate change plan (or whatever they call it without using that taboo phrase). Then the feds will have to extend the federal tax to Alberta, as with other provinces that don’t have plans, which will give Kenny a casus belli for his war.

The NDP under Motley made the mistake of showing themselves as being only partly progressive as in Blairite Labour as opposed to really progressive Corbynite Labour. There is no future for an NDP in the centre right as they found out Tuesday. If the voters want the centre right, they will vote for the real right as they did.

Motley backed off the royalty review and lost the progressive vote.

A real NDP government would own the oil like Norway does and take an owner’s share of the proceeds instead of a paltry 6% royalty and as owner’s would have the money to clean up the abandoned wells itself which will likely fall to the PROVINCIAL government to do anyway.

Well, here in Ontario, we now have the most unpopular premier in Canada. It’s incredible; most parties in their first mandate have a honeymoon period of a year or two. Ford’s PC party hit the ground offending and have upped the ante with every action and policy announcement (e.g. sex education, autism funding, trying to get a Ford crony as head of the OPP, Ontario Hydro boondoggles…I could go on). It’ll be interesting how this bodes for the federal election, since Ontario, unlike Alberta, has a tendency to vote in opposing parties in the federal and provincial jurisdictions. I can see voters checking off Liberal in October just to stick it to Ford.

There are serious political consequences for his Liberal federal government if he now allows the project to proceed. There are likewise serious political consequences if he doesn’t.

Thanks to the work done by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat, support for the TMX in Canada has probably reached its high-water mark. It has nowhere to go but down.

Thanks to the loss by Ms. Notley’s NDP Government of the April 16 Alberta election to the United Conservative Party led by Jason Kenney, support for the TMX outside the Prairie Provinces is almost certain to fall.

This is because Mr. Kenney, a former senior cabinet minister in the petrostatic Conservative federal government of Stephen Harper, has made it clear he will immediately repeal Alberta’s carbon tax, lift the cap on oilsands carbon emissions and return to the Harper Government’s strategy of belligerent bullying of Canadians who have their doubts about converting the country into a petro-state, especially now.

What Will Justin Do? (WWJD?)

Back on Nov. 29, 2016, when a confident Mr. Trudeau announced the approval of the TMX and two other large energy infrastructure projects, he reminded Canadians that during the previous year’s election campaign, “we said that major pipelines could only get built if we had a price on carbon and strong environmental protection in place.”

“Aside from the many and obvious economic benefits, we approved this project because it meets the strictest of environmental standards and fits within our national climate plan,” he said at that news conference.

“And let me say this definitely. We could not have approved this project without the leadership of Premier Notley and Alberta’s climate leadership plan, a plan that commits to pricing carbon and capping oilsands emissions at 100 megatonnes per year. We want to be clear on this point because it is important and sometimes not well understood.” (Emphasis added.)


Alberta premier-designate Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Alberta’s climate plan is a vital contributor to our national strategy. It has been rightly celebrated as a major step forward both by industry and by the environmental community,” Mr. Trudeau continued. “The Alberta plan provides a cap on emissions from oilsands over the mid-term, but allows for production to increase from present levels.”

In five days, Mr. Kenney will be sworn in an premier of Alberta and his first act, he has vowed, will be to tear up Alberta’s climate leadership plan, specifically the carbon tax and the oilsands emissions cap.

As has been predicted in this space, Mr. Kenney’s belligerent brand of TMX advocacy is likely to send fence-sitting British Columbians back to the anti-pipeline camp. It already seems to have had that effect in Quebec.

If Mr. Trudeau hopes to retain or increase seats in B.C. or Quebec, he will need to stand up to Mr. Kenney’s bluster – which the prime minister understands very well is part of a Republican-style co-ordinated national campaign by the Conservative Party and its provincial chapters to box him on the economy.

He surely also understands that if he fails to move forward on the TMX program he will look like a prat for having spent $4.5 billion of our collective money to by the existing line from Kinder Morgan Inc. of Houston, Tex., only to pull the plug on it. But no matter what he does, there are very few votes in Alberta for him.

It doesn’t help that the business case for more pipelines is a shaky one, which is why Kinder Morgan got the heck outta Dodge when it found a likely buyer for its depreciating 60-year-old asset.

It’s very hard to predict what the Liberals will do about this in the long run, but it’s obvious that their first instinct – and probably the right one in the political vise they now find themselves – will be to sniff the wind.

Last Thursday, federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi – an Edmonton MP whose re-election in the fall is, shall we say, problematic – announced Ottawa was extending its own deadline for a decision to approve the TMX from mid-May to June 18 to allow more time for consultations with First Nations as required by the courts.

Inquiring minds wondered at the time if that was a shot across the bow of the new Alberta government. Mr. Trudeau owes Mr. Kenney no favours.

Mr. Kenney understands this, presumably, and took a conciliatory tone in his response, although with a little bit of spin on it.

“I agreed with the prime minister that they need to make sure that they cross every t and dot every i when it comes to discharging the federal government’s duty to consult,” he told an impromptu news conference at Government House in Edmonton, where he had been discussing the transition with outgoing Premier Notley. “We certainly don’t want them to have to go back to the drawing board a third time on this.”

“We will continue on our part to build an alliance across the country that supports TMX and other pipelines,” he said. “We will continue to communicate the urgency of this to all Canadians.”

Well, no doubt he will try.

If the federal government decides to allow the project to proceed – perhaps with some First Nations ownership – that will expose Mr. Trudeau’s environmental posturing in 2015 and 2016 as an outright fraud.

If he doesn’t, at the very least he will stand accused of having made an extremely bad investment in a White Elephant pipeline.

Yesterday, Mr. Sohi said Ottawa can’t guarantee there will be a decision on the TMX before the next election, although he added that there probably will be.

“Each province is expected to have their own climate change plan in place and the cap on emissions from oilsands development is part of that plan and we look forward to working with the new government to understand how they will continue to either support that plan or have a new plan,” Mr. Sohi told reporters after a clean-energy announcement in Calgary.

“We understand the amount of emissions that are generated in Alberta are significant,” he added. D’ya think","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">Thanks to the work done by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat, support for the TMX in Canada has probably reached its high-water mark. It has nowhere to go but down.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thanks to the loss by Ms. Notley’s NDP Government of the April 16 Alberta election to the United Conservative Party led by Jason Kenney, support for the TMX outside the Prairie Provinces is almost certain to fall.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is because Mr. Kenney, a former senior cabinet minister in the petrostatic Conservative federal government of Stephen Harper, has made it clear he will immediately repeal Alberta’s carbon tax, lift the cap on oilsands carbon emissions and return to the Harper Government’s strategy of belligerent bullying of Canadians who have their doubts about converting the country into a petro-state, especially now.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>What Will Justin Do? (WWJD?)</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Back on Nov. 29, 2016, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ar0qdkusJo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=370"">when a confident Mr. Trudeau announced the approval of the TMX</a> and two other large energy infrastructure projects, he reminded Canadians that during the previous year’s election campaign, “we said that major pipelines could only get built if we had a price on carbon and strong environmental protection in place.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Aside from the many and obvious economic benefits, we approved this project because it meets the strictest of environmental standards and fits within our national climate plan,” he said at that news conference.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“And let me say this definitely. <i>We could not have approved this project without the leadership of Premier Notley and Alberta’s climate leadership plan</i>, a plan that commits to pricing carbon and capping oilsands emissions at 100 megatonnes per year. We want to be clear on this point because it is important and sometimes not well understood.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">“Alberta’s climate plan is a vital contributor to our national strategy. It has been rightly celebrated as a major step forward both by industry and by the environmental community,” Mr. Trudeau continued. “The Alberta plan provides a cap on emissions from oilsands over the mid-term, but allows for production to increase from present levels.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">In five days, Mr. Kenney will be sworn in an premier of Alberta and his first act, he has vowed, will be to tear up Alberta’s climate leadership plan, specifically the carbon tax and the oilsands emissions cap.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As has been predicted in this space, Mr. Kenney’s belligerent brand of TMX advocacy is likely to send fence-sitting British Columbians back to the anti-pipeline camp. It already seems to have had that effect in Quebec.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If Mr. Trudeau hopes to retain or increase seats in B.C. or Quebec, he will need to stand up to Mr. Kenney’s bluster – which the prime minister understands very well is part of a Republican-style co-ordinated national campaign by the Conservative Party and its provincial chapters to box him on the economy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He surely also understands that if he fails to move forward on the TMX program he will look like a prat for having spent $4.5 billion of our collective money to by the existing line from Kinder Morgan Inc. of Houston, Tex., only to pull the plug on it.&nbsp;But no matter what he does, there are very few votes in Alberta for him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It doesn’t help that the business case for more pipelines is a shaky one, which is why Kinder Morgan got the heck outta Dodge when it found a likely buyer for its depreciating 60-year-old asset.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s very hard to predict what the Liberals will do about this in the long run, but it’s obvious that their first instinct – and probably the right one in the political vise they now find themselves – will be to sniff the wind.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Last Thursday, federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi – an Edmonton MP whose re-election in the fall is, shall we say, problematic – <a href=""https://www.squamishchief.com/liberals-extend-deadline-for-trans-mountain-pipeline-decision-to-june-18-1.23795188"">announced Ottawa was extending its own deadline for a decision to approve the TMX</a> from mid-May to June 18 to allow more time for consultations with First Nations as required by the courts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Inquiring minds wondered at the time if that was a shot across the bow of the new Alberta government. Mr. Trudeau owes Mr. Kenney no favours.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Kenney understands this, presumably, and took a conciliatory tone in his response, although with a little bit of spin on it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I agreed with the prime minister that they need to make sure that they cross every t and dot every i when it comes to discharging the federal government’s duty to consult,” he told an impromptu news conference at Government House in Edmonton, where he had been discussing the transition with outgoing Premier Notley. “We certainly don’t want them to have to go back to the drawing board a third time on this.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“We will continue on our part to build an alliance across the country that supports TMX and other pipelines,” he said. “We will continue to communicate the urgency of this to all Canadians.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Well, no doubt he will try.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If the federal government decides to allow the project to proceed – perhaps with some First Nations ownership – that will expose Mr. Trudeau’s environmental posturing in 2015 and 2016 as an outright fraud.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If he doesn’t, at the very least he will stand accused of having made an extremely bad investment in a White Elephant pipeline.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Yesterday, <a href=""https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/federal-decision-on-trans-mountain-pipeline-before-election-not-guaranteed-sohi"">Mr. Sohi said Ottawa can’t guarantee there will be a decision</a> on the TMX before the next election, although he added that there <i>probably</i> will be.</p>
<p class=""p4"">“Each province is expected to have their own climate change plan in place and the cap on emissions from oilsands development is part of that plan and we look forward to working with the new government to understand how they will continue to either support that plan or have a new plan,” Mr. Sohi told reporters after a clean-energy announcement in Calgary.</p>
<p class=""p4"">“We understand the amount of emissions that are generated in Alberta are significant,” he added. <i>D’ya think?</i></p>

With record floods for the last three years in Eastern Canada, maybe the twittish attitude of Alberta that what we all really, really need is to shovel more dilbit on the market to burn, generate more CO2, increase climate change and hurry along the environmental disaster facing us all, is “for the good of Canada”. Sure it is. It’s downright wonderful! But Alberta prefers to think of itself as an island unaffected by all the chaos experienced elsewhere.

The biggest hypocrite is of course Premier Higgins of New Brunswick, an ex-Irving Oil office manager who “thinks” the cancelled Energy East pipeline should be resurrected as he stands in hipwaders directing matters in a flooded Fredericton Street, babbling nonsense about the carbon tax being an imposition. But Irving wants to make more money, so the poor bugger has to utter these inanities as if they made sense – it’s his primary job in a province where Irving owns virtually everything and hoards profits offshore. You have to hand it to the Conservative mini-minds across this land who bark defiance at carbon taxes, even as evidence of climate change rises around them. Cognitive dissonance that we are all supposed to cheer. “Let’s commit suicide!” yell the Conservatives, eager to keep corporate interests happy. “We’re OPEN for business and don’t care if we ruin our country making extra bucks for foreign and elitist interests by ripping off public resources for private interests for jobs with a lifetime of five years!”

Apparently millions of Canadians are happy to vote for these charlatans, and none more so than Albertans. When the sparkling Rockies’ glaciers are completely melted away and Alberta’s freshwater fades into nothingness leaving bitumen processing gasping for water, maybe Albertans will wake up. But on the basis of past performances, probably not. They’ll just blame it on someone else.

I see it a little differently. It appears to me that Rachel Notley made many deals with Justin Trudeau behind closed doors. I think the federal Liberal’s had much more to do with the developement of the NDP’s climate leadership plan than the NDP ever let on. One example is that it appears if the 100 megatonne cap is removed that the approval and regulation of new SAGD oilsands facilities will fall under the yet to be approved bill C-69.

It also appears that Justin Trudeau intends to use the Transmountain expansion as a political football in his re-election campaign. When Rachel Notley confidently predicted during the campaign that shovels will be in the ground by fall I am afraid she was absolutely wrong. As Amarjeet Sohi stated there is no guarantee of a decision before the election. I have always believed Trudeau had no intention of expanding Transmountain and my opinion hasn’t changed. What really baffles me though is why John Horgan continues to talk out of both sides of his mouth, on one hand he is lobbying the Feds over high gas prices in the lower mainland, that something needs to be done and on ther other lobbying against new pipelines! He wants new refineries built in BC on one hand and on the other is going to outlaw the sale of gas powered cars by 2040. If Transmountain was expanded more refined gasoline could travel through the existing line as BC’s only sources of regular gasoline are Alberta and Washington state.

There is no doubt very little will be accomplished before the upcoming federal election on any file that benefits Alberta. Enjoy your day.

I think what Mr. Trudeau will do will depend on circumstances. Yes, the Federal Liberals have invested a lot in this pipeline both financially and politically, so the default would probably be for it to move ahead. However, there are many different fingers in the pipeline pot and for it to move ahead many things need to go smoothly. There are things the Feds or Alberta can’t totally control, like court challenges and the actions of other provinces. Then there is Mr. Kenney himself, who has been and can be belligerent and to whom the Federal Liberals owe no favours.

If things are to move ahead, two things need to happen. First, the post election conciliatory sounding Kenney needs to remain that way regardless of what he promised his base about fighting. The rest of Canada will not put up with a belligerent Alberta Premier at this point and it will be the surest way for support for the pipeline to plummet. If that happens then the Liberals conditional support for the problem will probably quietly or not so quietly go away. The second thing, is Mr. Kenney needs to come up with something on the emissions cap. Alberta can have a pipeline or coal fired plants, but not both. Again, another promise Mr. Kenney made that will need to be quickly disposed of. Can Kenney do that? I suspect he can, I grassroots guarantee he is fully capable of forgetting, or ignoring any promises he made when convenient or necessary.

I think what Mr. Sohi was trying to say nicely is we need something like what the Feds agreed to with Premier Notley. It doesn’t need to be exactly the same, but pretty darn close. I also noticed the Ontario Environment Minister so helpfully recently pointed out that his province did a lot to reduce emissions by 20% (ahem .. mainly under the previous Liberal government of course, but I think he left that part out), so don’t expect Ontario to do more now. Ontario now expects the west to do more, and by that I don’t think he means BC. There is this portrayal of this grand Conservative alliance against Trudeau, but there are significant regional differences that will limit or maybe negate this. The Conservative leaning Premier of Quebec has already said non merci to Mr. Kenney’s ask for another eastern pipeline. Premier Notley probably knew better than to ever ask.

If Mr. Kenney does not want to be flexible, one of two things will happen, the pipeline will be delayed although probably not cancelled. As Mr. Sohi pointed out the decision rests with cabinet and they will determine when and how they decide. There is not as much of an urgent deadline for the Feds on this as for Alberta. Alternatively, the Feds may just impose more stringent limits on Alberta’s carbon emissions than the Notley plan. If Mr. Kenney doesn’t want to play ball, there will be a price to pay, the Liberals have little to lose politically by being tough on Alberta. I don’t know if Mr. Kenney’s apparent personal animosity to Mr. Trudeau is reciprocated, I think probably not entirely, but I am sure it exacerbates the lack of trust the Federal Liberals have with Kenney, so coming to any deal could be difficult.

re: TMX a White Elephant…

Trudeau Lib’s have committed all Canadians to subsidize the billions we’re going to lose on it. See the explanation with data in the links below.

Robyn Allan has studied TMX, made submissions on its sketchy economics, to the NEB hearing, to the federal gov’t, and generally reported for years now on the boondoggle that TMX has fully become.

It’s pretty clear that Justin is not going to do any favours for Kenney, and visa versa. So, no pipeline approvals before a federal election unless there is something in it for Justin’s future.
As discussed yesterday, reality will prevail despite the Kenney Konservatives resistance or inability to perceive reality. The facts, or the reality of facts, is that there is nothing Kenney can do to increase employment in the petro-industry, there is nothing he can do to increase prices paid for Alberta petro-product nor is there anything he can do to increase petro-production. He could, but he won’t, re-envision the Alberta petro-industry as a source for wealth generation for the state and people of Alberta. As such, he and the rest of the conservative brain-trust are left with their fantasy economics and fantasy development plans. Of course, their un-real and un-founded arguments will continue to rely on a kaleidoscope of blame-shifting that is now conservative and republican stock-in-trade. We will see how the Kenney Konservatives spin some (black) gold out of their straw man arguments.

If and when the petro-industry finds it profitable to ship another million bpd to the US west coast refiners they will ensure the twinned pipe is built. But they won’t find any such analysis.
It may turn out that Trudeau did Canadians a great service in buying TMP, basically nationalizing the western leg of the pipeline system. It keeps it out of the hands of reckless and irresponsible foreign operators. And it might just form the basis of a new reconstituted National Energy Program. Something that the Kenney and his handful of conservative collaborators are calling for, in substance, if not in name.

DC, very good points re Trudeau’s comments at the time TMX was approved. He left himself an escape pod. Why wouldn’t he use it now? The Liberals won four seats in Alberta (all of which are in trouble whatever he decides) and 17 in BC (almost all of which would be in trouble if he approves TMX). Seats elsewhere in the country would also be jeopardized. Surely we have by now learned that the answer to the question WWJD is: whatever is most politically expedient. We can draw our own conclusions.

If Trudeau approves TMX, the Liberals will get no votes from pipeline-manic conservatives, but will be abandoned by progressives in key ridings demanding real climate action.
The oil industry (CAPP) is going all out to unthrone the prince. Trudeau has nothing to gain by throwing right-wing attack dogs a bone. Nothing he can do will satisfy them. Same for Notley.

==================

Belot: Albertans have been fooled by a myth about pipelines and the oilsands

By Ross Belot in Opinion, former industry exec.

Energy | April 23rd 2019
https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/23/opinion/belot-albertans-have-been-fooled-myth-about-pipelines-and-oilsands
excerpt: Albertans have been had. But it isn’t by special interests outside this country. It’s by Canadian politicians of all stripes who continue to sell a myth, a myth that the reason the oilsands have stopped seeing major new investment is that we don’t have enough pipelines.

excerpt: No. It’s that other thing Kenney mentioned: an unprecedented oil boom south of the border. Fracked U.S. oil is attracting the capital. And that is because it is a much better resource to exploit. A review of investment trends in oilsands and fracked oil so far this century explains this.

excerpt: ‘U.S. crude oil production in July 2011 was 5.6 million barrels per day (MBD). By January 2015 it was 9.3 MBD. By October of last year production was up to 12 MBD and counting. ‘

excerpt: ‘…we don’t need all the pipelines under consideration. The combination of Enbridge Line 3, Trans Mountain Expansion and Keystone XL adds close to two million barrels per day (MBD) in pipeline capacity, almost twice as much as CAPP’s forecasted growth in production by 2030. That’s a forecast where industry assumes pipelines are available.
excerpt: ‘Canadians, especially Albertans, are being played.

A good example is Kenney’s crusade for Energy East, a pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick via Quebec. The economics don’t exist. And the Quebec government doesn’t want it. There isn’t enough new crude to fill such a large line and the refinery hardware in Eastern Canada for diluted bitumen is close to non-existent. Still, Kenney and his base love the idea. Economic reality is not a problem for them. ‘

That was an interesting article, Sam, thanks for posting the link. What I found most interesting was Mr. Belot’s response to commenters after the article, in which he discussed the break-even point for fracking and other oil sources. I also really liked his point that most of the revenue from fracking comes in the first three years of the project, whereas oilsands development is very much a long haul project.

Any long haul energy investment consideration has to factor in the eventual appearance of an electric car.

The UCP have made political hay about how there is much more energy investment in the US than here, blaming the NDP for it, but the brief reading of Mr. Belot’s article has me thinking that if I were investing in energy right now I would be more inclined to look at a fracking operation than an oilsands one. In 3 years I can have my investment pay out, and it is unlikely the electric car will have an impact in that time line. People thinking about investing in an oilsands project, however, might be wise to think about how their great grandfather bought a franchise in Blacksmiths-R-Us in 1900 (those horseless carriages are just a fad) or how their father invested in a (camera) film company in 1990.

I hope that the carbon tax takes into effect because we need to have a tool to discourage bad behaviour. He can’t not implement a carbon tax in Alberta and in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick who don’t have a carbon tax. If Albertans want other provinces and the federal government concerning the plight of workers here, then we have to not behave with a sense of entitlement. I also think that there has to some reality when it comes to our expectations. The oil industry is not coming back the way it was before the collapse in 2014. Automation has been many of those jobs and it might be possible that electric cars and other innovations could have an impact on the industry. This is the focus of all levels of government.

The “let the world burn” party, led by Saskatchewanian Andrew Scheer, could win each and every vote here in Oilberta, and still not win the next election. From a federal electoral perspective, the key battlegrounds are those parts of the country that are more skeptical about the value of expanding oil & gas infrastructure like pipelines, and others that are quite firmly opposed to it. The Notley government tried to have its cake and eat it too, by supporting both pipeline construction and some modest action on climate change, and look how far that got it … not that I’m criticizing them, that was the approach I supported, as it was the one most likely—had the chips fallen just a bit differently, like the Federal Court not throwing a monkey wrench into the works last August—to keep them in office where they could do a lot of good on files not connected to energy & the environment. But for pipeline advocates, the NDP simply didn’t do enough, although what else they could have done remained a mystery right up until E-Day; meanwhile, for hard-core environmentalists, they didn’t do enough on the climate, even though they clearly made the decision to embrace the art of the politically possible rather than take a radical position that could never be supported here at home.

So, Albertans turned out in record numbers to vote out the NDP government and bring in the “knuckle-draggers” of the UCP—in my own constituency, Grande Prairie-Wapiti, the official turnout was the highest in the province, at just over 80%, in a place where 49% is considered high—to take more aggressively ineffective action on pipelines, and to reverse, we suspect, virtually every positive, progressive measure the NDP took in its four year mandate. How all of this will get a pipeline to “tidewater” built is still a mystery, and in fact it just gives the Liberals cover, in conjunction with the Federal NDP, Federal Greens, and even the Bloc in Quebec, to stall and dither and block TMX until after we all go to the polls in October.

On the climate front, only the ScheerCons oppose the federal backstop carbon tax, although the Greens probably think it doesn’t go far enough. That will lose them votes in those places where people are worried about climate change, and win them even more votes in places like Alberta where they already get more than they need to win every seat.

What did embracing the “politically possible” get the NDP? A landslide victory for the UCP. NDP extirpation in rural AB with huge losses in Calgary.

What would have been the result if the NDP had stood up to Big Oil instead of kowtowing?
A landslide victory for the UCP. NDP extirpation in rural AB with huge losses in Calgary.
Not much difference.

The NDP had nothing to lose. Notley was always a one-term premier. So why not be fearless?
Retain your principles, govern with integrity, base your policies on the best available science, and tell the truth. Don’t deceive Canadians.
Set out a roadmap for AB’s sustainable long-term future. Show Albertans what a progressive govt looks like at its best.

P.S. Policies based on the best available science are “radical”?
If that’s what the “progressive” party believes, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Science becomes “radical” only when the “progressive” party rejects it.
If progressives stand up for science, the govt may still go down to defeat — but we still have a party that champions science. The integrity of progressive leaders remains intact.
Notley now embraces Vivian Krause’s conspiracy theories. Under her “radical” leadership, the NDP have done significant damage to the progressive brand in AB. Repair will take years.

I hope and trust that the Government of Canada will impose a C tax on those Provinces so perverse as to refuse to do so on their own.

I for one am tired of hearing about Alberta’s Rage ™, and think it critical that the federal government call their bluff. The electorate rejected any compromise with the rest of Canada, and mocks the notion of social license? Then cancel the TMX…that’s what they voted for. I’ve strongly defended the pipelines in social media, but never again.

I did not expect that the NDP would win, but I was appalled that their proportion of the popular vote decreased. DECREASED! The place is a lost cause, as far as I am concerned. At this point, with Kenney’s sights firmly fixed on Ottawa, I would not regard Alberta’s departure from Confederation as the worst thing in the world. Quite the reverse, frankly.

Note that this is posted more than a week after the election, so not in the heat of the moment. It’s my home Province, I’ve lived there more than half my life, even returned for 8 years after 15 years on the coast. But in all sober earnest, I am done with the place.

Likewise, with Canada creeping into the hot zone before a federal election, we may soon have the opportunity to test the veracity of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s assertion in November 2016 that approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion would not and could not have happened without the departing Alberta NDP government’s carbon tax and its cap on oilsands emissions, which Mr. Kenney has also promised to eliminate.


Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada: Itching for a fight? (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Backsliding is always possible in politics, of course, and there might be sound reasons for it on both sides in the current situation, but right now we seem to be headed for an intramural game of chicken between Ottawa and Edmonton.

So far, leastways, Mr. Kenney has not wavered in his public determination to make axing the C-tax the first piece of legislation he brings before the Alberta Legislature.

Nor has he wavered on other aspects of what is already coming to be called in other provinces his “revenge platform,” including immediately enacting the NDP’s unconstitutional “turn off the taps to B.C.” legislation and joining the hopeless courtroom grandstanding by other Conservative governments based on the unlikely notion Ottawa’s carbon tax is unconstitutional.

Meanwhile, “sources” close to the prime minister are dropping hints in the national press that the federal Liberals are “actively considering” blocking expansion of the TMX if Mr. Kenney goes ahead with blowing up the carbon tax, removing the 100-megatonne carbon cap, and implementing other parts of the ecocidal Kenney-Conservative agenda.

“The logic is that if there is no climate change plan, there can be no more pipelines,” columnist John Ivison wrote in the National Post on Thursday. That, he noted, “would likely play well in British Columbia and Quebec, where the Liberals believe they can pick up seats in the October election.”

Indeed it would, and even appearing to let Mr. Kenney’s plans slip through could be disastrous for the Liberals in those two jurisdictions. At the very least, we could expect a bonus for Elizabeth May’s Greens on the West Coast in October if Mr. Trudeau doesn’t stand up to Mr. Kenney’s bluster, and even a respite for the federal NDP led by Jagmeet Singh.

The PM also has to know that if he does permit Mr. Kenney’s agenda to proceed unhindered, the new Alberta premier will loudly proclaim it as a huge victory, evidence of the federal Liberals’ weakness and the bankruptcy of the whole “social license” approach to balancing environmental and economic interests.

So it’s this simple: If Mr. Kenney goes ahead as promised and Mr. Trudeau approves the pipeline anyway, the PM’s path to victory in the fall is very narrow; if he withdraws approval, or even kicks the can down the road, he has a much wider path to another term.

Yeah, no Liberals will be elected in Alberta and the local media will go into hysterics, but so what? Voters have already made up their minds in this province, and local columnists have already slipped over the edge!

On the other hand, the instant Mr. Trudeau announces the TMX is dead, he has lost any possibility he might restrain or influence Mr. Kenney, who will presumably then try to provoke a constitutional crisis by attacking B.C.’s economy in ways we have never seen before in Canadian history. Still, there’s only so much you can do without an army.

So my guess is that notwithstanding the Post’s claim Mr. Trudeau is “itching for a fight,” the federal government’s response will be to plead a need for more study and put off making a decision on the TMX until after the federal election, thereby eating its cake and having it too.

Moreover, as blogger Susan Wright pointed out yesterday, there’s no guarantee federal Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer would do much more for Mr. Kenney than Mr. Trudeau will. After all, the federal Conservative Party faces the same electoral math problem as the Liberals, in reverse. “The federal Conservatives could win every seat west of Ontario and Mr. Scheer would still need 63 seats from central Canada and the Atlantic provinces to form government,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, regardless of what happens with the TMX, there is another game afoot as well: the Liberal government’s desire to remain Canada’s Natural Governing Party and Mr. Kenney’s obvious ambition to return to Ottawa in prime ministerial triumph.

For Mr. Kenney’s ambition to be realized, the federal Conservatives must lose the 2019 election to Mr. Trudeau – else the ambitious Alberta premier and the rest of us might be stuck with several years of Mr. Scheer as prime minister. Talk about an unappealing prospect all ’round!

This presents some interesting problems for Mr. Kenney. He can’t appear to be too unenthusiastic about a Conservative victory in 2019 without ruining his prospects for inheriting the mantle of national party leadership afterward. Nor can he seem to be too accommodating to Mr. Trudeau.

I imagine Mr. Kenney was as pleased as Mr. Trudeau, therefore, to see recent polling that shows the Liberals finally closing the gap on Mr. Scheer’s Conservatives now that Jody Wilson-Reybould and Jane Philpott are gone from cabinet and the Liberal caucus and the SNC-Lavalin brouhaha seems to be receding into the past","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">Meanwhile, “sources” close to the prime minister are dropping hints in the national press that the federal Liberals are “actively considering” blocking expansion of the TMX if Mr. Kenney goes ahead with blowing up the carbon tax, removing the 100-megatonne carbon cap, and implementing other parts of the ecocidal Kenney-Conservative agenda.</p>
<p class=""p3"">“The logic is that if there is no climate change plan, there can be no more pipelines,” <a href=""https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-trudeau-itching-for-a-fight-if-kenney-overturns-pledge-to-cap-oilsands-emissions?video_autoplay=true"">columnist John Ivison wrote in the National Post on Thursday</a>.

I think there is no doubt that Justin Trudeau will use both Jason Kenney and Doug Ford stances on carbon taxes to get re-elected, they both certainly used the dislike of Justin Trudeau to win the respective campaigns. I read an article that in the recent election in PEI the provincial Liberal’s requested that the Prime Minister stay away because he wasn’t popular! Don Braid’s column on Catherine McKenna’s attitude towards Alberta’s oil was bang on in my opinion!

I am certainly surprised David that you appear to still support Justin Trudeau. As a farmer I will give you a couple of examples of why I don’t. A couple of years ago India imposed tariffs on pulse crops exported from Canada. This reduced the price of peas and lentils. What I recieve for my yellow peas went from $8 a bushel to $7. How did our Prime Minister respond? He went to India and played Mr. Dressup! Now we have China backing out of buying western Canadian Canola. Justin Trudeau has not handled China well. He tried to get labour, gender, environment and governance issues entrenched in the negotiating framework of the free trade talks and China basically told him to take a hike. Then they detained Huawei Exec. Meng Wanzhou as asked by the USA. Then they fired John McCallum from his post as Ambassador to China and haven’t appointed a replacement. China purchases 40% of exported canola seed. This is going to have a large negative impact on western Canadian farmers bottom line. Let’s be realistic Justin Trudeau wants to replace jobs in the oil patch in western Canada with jobs installing solar panels made in China. Enjoy your day.

Farmer Brian, no worries, now that Jason Kenney is our leader he will wave his magic wand and your canola will be sold and the TMX pipeline will get built in his first 100 days in office. Hold on to your hat because we all in Alberta are in for a rough ride with Kenney calling the shots, particularly in health.

I am closely connected to a person in the health industry who went to university and employed both in Alberta and London England and in England they went through the same thing, privatising health such as blood work as past governments have done in Alberta and it turned out to be a disaster and England returned to government controlled lab’s because for important health research purposes. And now Kenney stops construction of the mega lab research centre which started construction near the U of A. And he wants to turn off the oil taps to B.C. Talk about a Kenney style job killer and less money for the oil business sector and farmers. You may need to get out from under the dome and do your own research instead of reading an article in the paper and taking it as fact.

Enjoy your day

The bungling of canola sales to China and the rest of the grain export mess is the joint responsibility of both Harper and Trudeau. Take a look at this widely circulated article on China, Trudeau, and canola from three years ago for a bit of background:http://www.cwbafacts.ca/2016/09/4780/

The short version is that 3 years ago China wanted less crap (stems, pods, chaff) in their canola shipments. Prairie farmers already produce and deliver canola that would almost meet the standard China requested. Instead Trudeau insulted the Chinese, so they gave him a couple of years to get Canadian canola exports cleaned up. It did not happen and now they are going elsewhere for their supplies. Same thing happened with India, and later Italy and North Africa with durum wheat. The customer is always right and insulting them is never a good idea.

If memory serves, no Canadian premier has ever become prime minister. I see nothing in Kenney’s approach to date that will change this. (I don’t mean this to slam Kenney either.). As I believe Mr. Climenhaga pointed out earlier as well, Kenney has no experience running a government. When this is combined with his lack of personal charisma (a defect shared by 95 percent of the population), I am not sure how many of his preferred policies will be enacted. (I may have made these points before in this forum, so forgive the repetition if that is the case.)

Charles Tupper was premier of Nova Scotia from 1864 to 1867, to July 3, 1867, so it could be argued he was the premier of a Canadian province for two days. He was prime minister of Canada for 69 days in 1896. He was the last Canadian premier to become a prime minister. DJC.

And all these ‘politics as usual’ games will be widely watched, and narrowly commented on, ad nauseam, while the planet heats up, floods and fires, hurricanes and droughts visit those unlucky enough to live on the actual ground……….

At some point, we’re going to have to start another conversation, and pay significantly more attention to a different ‘power source’. Everything about the Kenny victory suggests the triumph of fantasy hopes over fearful realities….but as W.B.Yeats said of another civil crisis decades ago:
We had fed the heart on fantasy,
The heart’s grown brutal from the fare
More substance in our enmity
Than in our loves….” He was speaking of Ireland, but it could as easily be said of current Alberta, where fantasy visions of continued oil prosperity, and hateful plans for vengeance against an imaginary enemy appear to have captivated a majority of the citizens.

Can’t wait for the referendum on equalization payments and the wealth bonanza that is going to be for the province!

“…fantasy visions of continued oil prosperity, and hateful plans for vengeance against an imaginary enemy appear to have captivated a majority of the citizens.”

I agree. Several weeks ago Jen Gerson wrote an op ed piece for CBC in which she argued that the angst we are seeing in this province is a result of people starting to realize that Alberta’s oil wealth is starting to fade, and they are not reacting well to the idea. I really think the election result was partly based on Albertans’ desperate attempt cling to Jason Kenney’s offer of a denial.

The whole thing reminds me of how my neighbour’s son turned really bratty the summer he was 5, and (I think) was terrified of his future where he had to go to school. Threats like turning off the taps, holding a meaningless referendum, and leaving Canada really do fit in a category of temper tantrum.

I think the ‘Equalization Referendum’ could be interesting, in that it could also prove to be a vote of confidence, or lack of, for the Kenney government. Given that almost 50% of the electorate did not want Jason Kenney as their premier, and the fact that UCP supporters could use the referendum to express their disillusionment without having to vote NDP, the referendum could prove to be very embarrassing for Mr. Kenney.

His second act is to cancel the railcars.

“Cenovus Energy Inc. is concerned the domestic market’s fragile balance and lift from higher heavy oil prices could be jeopardized if Alberta’s new government cancels oil-by-rail contracts.
…
‘There’s no doubt in my mind that we need oil-by-rail in this province if we ever hope to get away from curtailment and get back to a point where we can add production,’ said Pourbaix in an interview.
…
Cenovus moved 20,000 barrels of oil per day on railway cars at the beginning of April, but Pourbaix said new tank cars were arriving and the company would be ramping up shipments to 100,000 bpd by the end of the year.”

I think JT will quickly become competitive with Scheer as soon as people witness their respective parliamentary demeanours (the HoC is back in session); it was JT’s silence about SNC-Lavilin that lowered his polling numbers, after all, not to mention that it was Andrew Scheer who trucked with the racists at the Ottawa protest rally. D’ohFo has done his share of immigrant bashing but, naturally, Scheer can’t offer a buck-a-beer—nor a buck-a-litre for gasoline.

Scheer, of course, can only dream of winning every seat west of Ontario. And I don’t know how to read Ivison’s idea that JT will play well in BC. It sure doesn’t seem that way here on the Island where Green support is probably the highest in the country.

Jason KeKKenney provoke a constitutional crisis? As Premier John Horgan already demonstrated to Christy Clark, he’s not one to shrink from court action and an injunction against anything remotely unconstitutional could easily be obtained within three days, at most.

PS: KeKKenney was alleged to have sung the politically incorrect, gendered version of the national anthem. In fact, it’s impossible to tell from verbal utterances whether he sang, “In all our sons’ command,” or, “In all our sun’s [as in, ‘days’] command,” which is what I always took it for.

For the post-government Alberta New Democratic Party, there is a common phrase in Italian that may apply to the next four years: Vivere pericolosamente. It means “living dangerously.” It’s a phrase Italians use to describe living close to places that are susceptible to disaster – volcanoes, floods, avalanches, and the like.

Why are Alberta’s New Democrats living dangerously? Some would correctly point out that the raw votes collected by the party went up slightly in the April 16 Alberta general election. They would note that 24 seats in the Legislature is the second-best result the party has ever had.

New Democrats can also point to the rude fiscal health of the party and its riding associations. No other party can claim to be logistically capable of challenging the governing United Conservatives. Compared to disastrous elections for the NDP in 1993 or 2008, the future looks positively glowing.

But they’re not the first section of the New Democratic Party to return to Opposition after a single term in government. Other NDP branches across Canada have had similar experiences, and their histories should give optimistic Alberta New Democrats pause.

In 1990, Bob Rae and the Ontario NDP unexpectedly swept into power, and quickly got hammered by a brutal recession exacerbated by a national economy painfully adapting to NAFTA. After losing in 1995, New NDP Leader Howard Hampton took on a brutal tour schedule to rebuild his party.


Nova Scotia NDP Leader Gary Burrill (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The results didn’t match the effort. The party dropped from 21 to 13 per cent of the popular vote and from 17 to nine seats, and the Ontario NDP would struggle to keep official party status for two more elections.

In 2007, the dynastic Saskatchewan NDP lost government after 16 years despite successfully rebuilding the province’s fiscal health. However, they held a healthy 20 seats filled with veteran former cabinet ministers.

Former Deputy Premier Dwain Lingenfelter returned from the private sector to provide a familiar face to voters, but it backfired in 2011. Rural and suburban voters fled to the conservative Saskatchewan Party, and the NDP dropped to nine seats. Eight years later, that seat total has only grown to 13. Only two of those seats are rural.


Former Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton (Photo: TheSilentPhotographer, Creative Commons).

In 2013, Darrell Dexter’s government was reeling from brutal Liberal attacks and a campaign organized very late in the term. Despite recovering enough to finish second in popular vote, the party was reduced to seven seats.

A new avowed socialist leader, Gary Burrill, could not build on those results. In 2017, the Nova Scotia NDP held onto its seven seats, but dropped 6 per cent of the vote, to a share of 21.5 per cent, mostly in rural ridings.

Is the Alberta NDP similarly doomed? An examination of the ridings the NDP lost doesn’t reveal many the party could easily recapture. A handful of North Calgary seats and a few Edmonton suburbs could be recaptured with a small swing to the New Democrats. But the only rural seat that looks easily winnable is Banff-Kananaskis. This would still leave the party well short of the 44 seats required for a majority in the Alberta Legislature.


Former Ontario NDP premier Bob Rae (Photo: Will Pate, Creative Commons).

And of the 24 seats the NDP currently holds, not many were blowout wins. Many Edmonton seats that sit on the Anthony Henday ring road were won by margins under 10 per cent. The NDP’s sole seat outside of Edmonton and Calgary, Lethbridge West, was won by less than 1 per cent.

But a further decline is not inevitable. The party has four years to rediscover its capacity to speak to rural Albertans. They are proportionally far better funded than Mr. Hampton’s, Mr. Lingenfelter’s, or Mr. Burrill’s ill-fated campaigns.

The Alberta NDP will have a healthy Opposition caucus budget with capacity for lots of leader touring and 20 or more staff. And the new diverse caucus has MLAs that know their job is outreach in their neighbourhoods, not delivering flowery speeches at the Legislature.

Learning from this history and robust outreach outside of the Capital Region can give the Alberta NDP a chance to live a little more safely than its neighbouring New Democrat provincial parties. It’s long odds to regain the premier’s seat in 2023, but not impossible. And that election may prove a little more dangerous for Conservatives than progressive Albertans","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">The results didn’t match the effort. The party dropped from 21 to 13 per cent of the popular vote and from 17 to nine seats, and the Ontario NDP would struggle to keep official party status for two more elections.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2007, the dynastic Saskatchewan NDP lost government after 16 years despite successfully rebuilding the province’s fiscal health. However, they held a healthy 20 seats filled with veteran former cabinet ministers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Former Deputy Premier Dwain Lingenfelter returned from the private sector to provide a familiar face to voters, but it backfired in 2011. Rural and suburban voters fled to the conservative Saskatchewan Party, and the NDP dropped to nine seats. Eight years later, that seat total has only grown to 13. Only two of those seats are rural.</p>

<p class=""p1"">In 2013, Darrell Dexter’s government was reeling from brutal Liberal attacks and a campaign organized very late in the term. Despite recovering enough to finish second in popular vote, the party was reduced to seven seats.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A new avowed socialist leader, Gary Burrill, could not build on those results. In 2017, the Nova Scotia NDP held onto its seven seats, but dropped 6 per cent of the vote, to a share of 21.5 per cent, mostly in rural ridings.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Is the Alberta NDP similarly doomed? An examination of the ridings the NDP lost doesn’t reveal many the party could easily recapture. A handful of North Calgary seats and a few Edmonton suburbs could be recaptured with a small swing to the New Democrats. But the only rural seat that looks easily winnable is Banff-Kananaskis. This would still leave the party well short of the 44 seats required for a majority in the Alberta Legislature.</p>

<p class=""p1"">But a further decline is not inevitable. The party has four years to rediscover its capacity to speak to rural Albertans. They are proportionally far better funded than Mr. Hampton’s, Mr. Lingenfelter’s, or Mr. Burrill’s ill-fated campaigns.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Alberta NDP will have a healthy Opposition caucus budget with capacity for lots of leader touring and 20 or more staff. And the new diverse caucus has MLAs that know their job is outreach in their neighbourhoods, not delivering flowery speeches at the Legislature.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Learning from this history and robust outreach outside of the Capital Region can give the Alberta NDP a chance to live a little more safely than its neighbouring New Democrat provincial parties. It’s long odds to regain the premier’s seat in 2023, but not impossible. And that election may prove a little more dangerous for Conservatives than progressive Albertans.</p>

My guess is turnout won’t be as high or as favourable for the UCP in 2023 which will benefit the ABNDP immensly and maybe the AB Party to. People will have four years to digest a UCP government and some people will be turned off by the constant populist rhetoric, along with their at times incompetent governing and they would like a stronger opposition to counter it to give the UCP a scare. The biggest reason the UCP won by over 20 points in the recent election is because people were scared of voting for opposition parties because the ABNDP might form government again. This fear of the ABNDP returning to government will subside by 2023. The direction the UCP is heading in at the moment is also sure to lead to some bleeding of votes to other parties in 2023. As a result of this I could see the ABNDP recovering all across Alberta and rising to around 40 percent of the vote again. I could also see the AB Party end up with a vote share between 10 and 15 percent in 2023 to. If the RCMP investigation proves to be really damaging to the UCP the ABNDP might do incredibly well in 2023. With Notley sticking around as the ABNDP leader for now along with the ABNDP’s likely reluctance to move to the left because they want to form government again one day and because of the lack of moderate parties in the legislature they will keep the vast majority of their support in 2023.

We’ve yet to see a full disclosure of the ethical failings of the new UCP givernment, although they were playing peek-a-boo with the electorate in this regard even before the writ was dropped.
Mind you, I’m assuming that this trifling matter of ethics is of any importance to UCP voters. To judge by the last election, it isn’t.

I think it is good to look and see the experience elsewhere, when faced with a new situation here and this post is thoughtful and well reasoned, however in this case I take a slightly different view. History often does repeat itself, but not exactly and not always.

First, Alberta’s political history is quite different from that of any other province, I would say unique. In the past, we did not have a strong three party system like some provinces, such as Ontario, or even a very strong two party system like BC or Saskatchewan or Nova Scotia. For those of us who have lived here a long time, 2015 was an election somewhat like 1971. It unexpectedly smashed the entrenched order and something new and different arose. The once invincible PC party had a great fall like humpty dumpty, it would never be put together again, although interestingly it still exists in name only. If given the choice, my guess is more than 20% of Albertans would still vote PC if it was on the ballot everywhere, much like Social Credit continued to linger on long after it lost power in 1971. Therefore one of the most important things for the UCP is to make sure it keeps control of that name under lock and key. The big difference however, unlike 1971 we did not immediately jump to another slightly different more modern Conservative leaning party in 2015.

I think we are in an era of political flux, where the new Alberta (immigrants, younger people and minorities) and the old Alberta (Mr. Kenney and crew) will battle for control of political power over the next several years. Yes, I think we may actually be seeing the beginnings of a real two party system here. I suspect this is as unimaginable to many people now as the change in government was in 2015. Mr. Kenney’s win might appear to some as a natural resumption of conservative dominance of Alberta, however the PC’s who were successful for a long time were often not as conservative as they appeared and Mr. Kenney is. I would say he is out of step with modern Alberta and that may eventually lead to his downfall. He won because of economic concerns and people were willing to temporarily set aside their concerns about other aspects of him and his party for now.

If we look at other provinces with two party systems, we also don’t see a lot of parties currently being elected to a second or third term anymore. Indeed, the same thing actually just happened to Alberta. Alberta may be late in getting to the two party system, but if Mr. Kenney does not deliver the economic miracle he promised, his government could be end up being a one term government as well. As there is no viable third party in Alberta now with any MLA’s. This that means the NDP here has a better shot at reclaiming power than in any of the other scenarios from the past in other provinces. It will not be easy and it will not be automatic, but in this case it is in the realm of the very possible.

What I think the NDP would need to relearn, or rather just learn, is how to seize a transformational moment.
There is no version of business-as-usual, on the energy/ecology file that an evidence-based progressivism could found itself upon. Trump, Brexit, Corbyn, Sanders … there is a profound yearning out there for deep change, a break with an elite status quo. But steering a middle course between driving over a cliff slow or fast simply cannot be glossed as pragmatism. Give it to us straight. Call it an emergency, and back it up with commensurate action. Say it’s going to be hard, but with a chance that some good things may actually be better, if we work to get there together, on the far side of ecological bottleneck.

Subtly undercutting the new Alberta premier’s claimed reason for proclaiming the act by noting his explanation in a phone conversation that it was just a sop to his base, a genial Mr. Horgan told reporters in Victoria without bluster that “our lawyers today filed two actions in court to strike down the bill because we believe it’s unconstitutional.”


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Premier Horgan also used his news conference in the Legislature’s rose garden to ratchet up pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to use the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline, the proximate cause of Alberta’s ongoing temper tantrum, to help reduce gasoline prices in B.C.’s Lower Mainland.

Mr. Horgan, celebrating the fifth anniversary of his leadership of the B.C. NDP, noted that if there’s no intent by Alberta to use the legislation immediately, as Mr. Kenney told him in their call, then the B.C. government’s legal action can’t be described as provocative.

“During the call with the premier, I made it clear to him that my job, as is his, is to protect and defend the interests of the province that I represent, and I fully intend to continue to do that,” he said. In other words, Mr. Kenney ought not to expect his blackmail effort to work very well.

Be that as it may, Mr. Horgan noted, “at no time over the past two years have we disrupted or delayed the permitting process in any way beyond those delays that would be required to protect the interests of British Columbia.”

“From the beginning, I have been using existing court actions to ensure that British Columbians’ interests are protected,” he continued, comparing British Columbia’s reference case on environmental regulation of the Trans Mountain Pipeline to that of Ontario and Saskatchewan (loudly supported by Mr. Kenney during the Alberta election campaign) against Ottawa on the carbon tax.

In other words, it’s that rule-of-law thing again that Mr. Kenney used to talk about so much. As an aside, isn’t it the moral equivalent of obstruction of justice for one province to threaten to cut off essential supplies to another if it won’t knuckle under and cease using its legal right to access the courts? Just wondering.

In response to a reporter’s question, Mr. Horgan also called BS on the claims of Alberta politicians, and not just Mr. Kenney and his United Conservatives, that high gasoline prices in British Columbia have anything whatsoever to do with the Trans Mountain Pipeline or the speed at which it is being completed.

“Looking at the materials that were put before the National Energy Board, the TMX proposal did not contemplate increasing refined product in any way,” Premier Horgan noted.

“In fact, quite the opposite … there is less refined product coming into the Lower Mainland now with the existing pipeline and no commitment from TMX to do something about that with the twinning of the pipeline,” he said, kicking the can on opening up more capacity in the pipe to increase the supply of refined products to B.C. to the pipeline’s current owner, which, you know, is the Government of Canada.

“I’m trying to take steps working with the owners of the pipeline, the federal government, to try and see some way that we can reduce the export of diluted bitumen and increase refined product coming into the Lower Mainland. That will help stabilize prices as other refining capacity comes back on stream.”

That will also make some Albertans crazy, since we have persuaded ourselves that increasing the supply of bitumen by shipping it to additional markets will also increase the price it fetches, something many of us were taught in Economics 101 is not the way things work.

“It’s undeniable that there is more bitumen coming in and less refined products coming in,” Mr. Horgan added, comparing the current use of the existing line to that in earlier years, “and the consequence of that is that prices are going up.”

This makes the position Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself in slightly more interesting, it seems to me. By acting on what Premier Horgan is saying, the PM can infuriate Alberta but lose no votes because there are essentially none here for him anyway. Or he can infuriate the voters of B.C.’s Lower Mainland, enough of whom are actually inclined to vote for his Liberal Party to possibly give it another term in government, and thereby lose the election in the fall.

As Mr. Horgan put it: “You own the pipeline. Get some gasoline into that pipeline.”

What would you do in the PM’s shoes?

At any rate, Mr. Horgan’s collected response to Mr. Kenney makes it worth listening to the entire news conference, which is easily done thanks to CBC Edmonton.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney appears to want to channel Vladimir Putin, the master of the natural gas taps to Europe.

There may indeed be an argument for Canadian refineries east of the Lakehead to buy more “ethical” Alberta oil, as we Albertans keep insisting they should, but giving Alberta governments regardless of their political stripe the opportunity to turn the taps on and off to achieve their policy goals doesn’t seem like a strong long-term argument for achieving this goal","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

I think you’re giving Vlad a bad rap. Ukraine was getting a bargain price for the gas they took out of the trans-Ukraine pipe and was way behind on the payments. If BC was doing that with the the TMX, Alberta would have a valid complaint.

It seems a bit ripe for Horgan to claim in court filings in Alberta that it is unconstitutional for our provincial government to control the flow of oil products flowing out of Alberta to BC, having previously filed a lawsuit in BC seeking to control the flow of Alberta’s oil products through and out of BC. To many it seems that Horgan is sucking and blowing while attempting to have his cake and eat it. This is naturally infuriating to many Albertans, which is part of the reason Kenney’s blusterous approach to the pipeline issue was so successful in the provincial election.

I’m also not sure how these threats to turn off the taps will affect the mindsets of Canadians outside Alberta, if the Alberta government attempts to market itself as the main supplier of oil products to the rest of Canada, replacing “unethical oil”. We’re hardly holding ourselves out as a reliable supplier of oil products if we keep on threatening to curtail supply during disputes with other provinces.

I don’t think that’s what British Columbia is arguing in either case. It is arguing, in the case of Alberta’s threat, that it violates the inter-provincial trade provisions of the constitution. So Alberta can restrict outflows, but not where they go. The consensus among constitutional experts seems to be that this is a strong case. And whatever the reasons for the original talk by B.C. to put environmental controls on the contents and operation of a federally regulated pipeline. The consensus among the same experts seems to be that that’s a weak case. DJC

So far it is a very civil, civil war and it might be smart for the genial Mr. Horgan and Mr. Trudeau to keep it that way. Mr. Kenney is looking for someone to demonize for Alberta’s troubles, which are basically low oil and gas prices, added to by lack of pipeline capacity. Even if the second problem is immediately solved, the first will not be. Mr. Kenney tends to ignore or dismiss the first more important and intractable problem. I suppose it is difficult for a conservative to whip up anger against “the markets”, although Premier Aberhart did just that years ago, but that was a very different time for Alberta.

My advise to Mr. Horgan and Mr. Trudeau would be to not play Kenney’s game. Sound reasonable and pleasant and public opinion in Canada will tilt towards you, rather than the sometimes raving lunatic from Alberta. I am sure much of the rest of Canada has almost had enough of Alberta’s incessant whining already – we still have a much higher than average income and labour participation rate than most of Canada. If you want to see economic hardship, go to somewhere like New Brunswick, where many people get by on less than that the monthly payments for a new big blue truck and always have. Unfortunately, they are not blessed with an abundance of oil, like Alberta has.

The Federal Conservative’s oil uber alles approach is also not going over well in key provinces they need to win in the next election, such as BC and Quebec. However, I suspect Mr. Kenney does not really care much about the Federal Conservatives winning an any upcoming Federal election, at least not until he can somehow stage manage his return to Ottawa. Yes, Alberta’s interests may appear to be in conflict with that of BC and Ottawa, but really nothing would probably suit Kenney better than if Mr. Trudeau won a second term now. There may be some drama and apparent conflict, but sounding reasonable will take the air out of Kenney’s over inflated balloon of outrage, which is probably due to disappear soon anyways and to be forgotten just like the grassroots guarantee or Mr. Aberhart’s funny money.

The source of BC gas price hikes: the lack of competitive markets… citizens gouged by oligopoly and collusion.

excerpt: Lee told PressProgress “There is limited competition in the refining industry for Vancouver consumers.” With just 4 refineries — run by Parkland, Shell, Imperial and Suncor — supplying BC with fuel, they can gouge customers without fear they’ll take their business elsewhere.

“We’re looking at over a billion dollars a year of excess profits that are being harvested out of the region,” Lee told Chek News.

Additionally, the four refineries are closely-linked with other parts of the supply-chain, further diminishing competition, Lee said. “Those four companies also have linkages to the retail side, either as direct owners or through long term supply contracts.”

Lee described the refineries as an oligopoly — where the market is dominated by a small number of very powerful firms.

Lee told PressProgress government action is one of the only real ways to keep prices in check. “Minimally we need some government investigation of industry practices as a lot of key information is hidden away,” he added. Currently, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Quebec have some form of gas price regulation.

Well, Putin is a bad analogy, I think. Russia’s about-to-be-opened Nord Stream gas pipeline through the Baltic increases supply to Germany and Western Europe, while avoiding the nutbars in Ukraine through whose territory the current pipeline runs and which siphons off some for free. Kenney is threatening to pump less gasoline to BC through the federally owned ex-Kinder Morgan batch pipeline which strikes me as the opposite tack. Why the feds would ever agree to such BS is beyond me, so it likely won’t happen no matter what Kenney proclaims. Internal trade in Canada between provinces is bad enough as it is because every tinpot provincial government protects its turf, the most obvious case being beer and alcohol.

If one looks at the NEB webpages, 3.6 mmb/d of light and mostly heavy crude oil were exported from Canada in 2018 almost entirely to the US. From 2010 to 2107, production increased by 47%, mostly bitumen. It increased by 6.5% from 2016 to 2017, and by a further 8% from 2017 to 2018, while Notley all the while gave us the fandango that things were getting worse. Presumably the royalty scheme is so buggered that instead of a per barrel equivalent royalty for flogging off public assets, it’s tied to the selling price instead. Whose fault is that?

With those kind of increases, whose benefit seems to have eluded Alberta entirely, any chance of Canada reducing its global GHG emissions as we committed to is nil. So Kenney swanning about uttering further non-truths is more than a sane person can endure without spitting back. (About the way I feel about the NEB webpages whose organization is so poor and scattered, trying to find the same info two days in a row is an exercise in pure annoyance)

Oil imports are over 50% from the USA, light crude oil that Quebec and NB refineries can actually process since none are fitted with cokers. The remainder is from all over the place, wherever the refineries can get a cheap ship load of suitable grade.

I’m not sure where the mindset that Canada owes Alberta a special living comes from, but the self-entitlement attitude is grating. Especially considering the huge increases in production this past decade when the opposite impression is given pubicly by Alberta.

so 800K were imported. 54% was US product

190,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Vindication? Board of Internal Economy renders a Scotch verdict on Jason Kenney’s ethical lapse,2019-05-04 01:44:00,David Climenhaga,,"CALGARY – Jason Kenney’s been in power for less than a week and already his election promises are falling like dominoes.*

Yesterday, another wobbled when the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled that the federal government has the power to establish limits on greenhouse gas production that provinces must meet, and to establish a carbon tax if they won’t meet them.

Well, it wasn’t Mr. Kenney’s legal bid to overturn Ottawa’s carbon tax that was dismissed, it was the Saskatchewan government’s. But the Alberta premier has promised to use taxpayers’ supposedly limited money to launch his own appeal of the same federal legislation with the same arguments, the same likely outcome, and the same goal – to wit, to play partisan politics against the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The court’s ruling was a split decision, so it can be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, giving Mr. Kenney and his fellow Conservative provincial chapter leaders opportunity to throw additional roadblocks in the way of the federal policy – just as they accuse B.C. Premier John Horgan of doing to ruin their Trans Mountain pipedream.

But onto every rain-soaked head a little sun must shine, and there was good news for Mr. Kenney yesterday as well.


Canadian economist Jim Stanford (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I speak, of course, of the announcement by the Board of Internal Economy, the quaintly named committee responsible for the financial and administrative affairs of the House of Commons, that it has completed its examination of Mr. Kenney’s claim a room in his mother’s Calgary nursing home was his principal residence while he was an MP, and therefore that it was OK for him to claim $10,000 a year from 2012 to 2015 to maintain a “secondary” residence in Ottawa.

According to the CBC, the committee “cleared Alberta Premier Jason Kenney of any wrongdoing.”

This assertion is subject to debate. A more accurate summary would be that the board – which, notwithstanding numerous headlines to this effect, is obviously no “watchdog” – determined that no rules were broken.

There is a subtle but important distinction between “there was no wrongdoing” and “no rules were broken.” It is the difference between “not guilty” and the useful third verdict available in what we used to call Scotch Law, “not proven.”

The unavoidable conclusion to any Canadian remotely familiar with the circumstances of Premier Kenney’s residential arrangements during his years as a Conservative MP for Calgary is that the “rules” of the Board of Internal Inquiry, such as they are, amount to no rules at all when it comes to living expenses for MPs from outside the region around Ottawa.

No ethical person, even if they really did live in their mom’s basement, would have claimed their principal residence in Ottawa was their secondary residence in order to cash in on the generous secondary housing allowance available to MPs. That the rules were so loosey-goosey it could be done is, as my mama used to say, no excuse.

Clearly, the House of Commons’ efforts to make its members behave ethically are only aspirational and amount to the sort of self-regulation the Kenney Government advocates for the corporate sector.

Nevertheless, we’re bound to hear soon – probably in the breathless stenography of some award-winning Postmedia columnist – that Premier Kenney has been “vindicated” in this sorry affair.

But let us not relitigate that point, but move on to what other rules must have been broken.

After all, Mr. Kenney has only been vindicated in the way U.S. President Donald Trump was vindicated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. That is, plenty of actual rules were broken even if the Board of Internal Inquiry was not mandated to look into them.

For example, the Calgary facility in which Mr. Kenney claims to have rented a basement room in his mother’s suite is known not to permit sub-letting.

So if he were sub-letting the space, as he claims, he was breaking that rule. And if he wasn’t, and was lying about it, he was breaking one of the Ten Commandments, a set of rules said to be mandated by a higher authority than that of the Board of Internal Economy.

In addition, the seniors’ residence in question doesn’t allow non-seniors to reside there permanently – another rule broken, unless Mr. Kenney and the Wikipedia alike are lying about his age.

Moreover, when he donated money to his bromantic partner Doug Ford’s Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, which was illegal unless he happened to be a resident of Ontario, he was breaking Ontario election law if he was telling the truth to the House of Commons when he famously checked with officials to ensure his housing claim was within the rules.

Mr. Kenney really can’t have this both ways. Either he was breaking the Ontario law, or he wasn’t – in which case he was lying about where his principal residence was located. Either way, since he never seems to have owned up to breaking Ontario law, the premier’s actions in Ottawa do not pass the ethical sniff test.

And by the way, the operator of the maternal nursing home, like all such companies, would have received a significant grant from the province of Alberta to build the place. So, in effect, even if Mr. Kenney told the truth, his was mooching off both the provincial and federal governments!

Vindication? I think not.

*I would love to take credit for this great line, but as an ethical blogger, I cannot. It belongs to the well-known Canadian economist and author Jim Stanford, now a resident of Australia, who used it an informative talk in Calgary yesterday on the similarities between the Canadian fur trade of the 17th to the 19th centuries and the Canadian fossil fuel trade of the 20th and 21st. “Canada is never going to run out of oil, just like it never ran out of beavers,” Dr. Stanford observed. I plan to write a post on Dr. Stanford’s thoughtful presentation, but since he speaks extemporaneously as well as forcefully, I will need some time to transcribe a recording.

Jason Kenney knew all along that he could weasel out of this since the “rules” allow sleazy politicians to line their pockets.

Mike Duffy played that game too, but even he eventually had to crawl back under a rock. Hopefully the same happens to Kenney.

David, on the topic of Jason Kenney’s housing ethics, I really loved the column you wrote when this issue first came out.
It was about the CTF director’s take on the ‘no rules were broken’ defense when a similar issue surfaced with Alberta politicians about 20 years ago. Could you post a link to it, please?

I’m looking forward to the post on the Jim Stanford talk. It just so happens I’ve been thinking about the fur trade for awhile now in the historical context as it relates to fossil fuel extraction. With energy prices going the way they are, a beaver pelt may be worth more than a barrel of oil pretty soon. Which may be a good thing since it will mean Jason Kenney will be spending most of his time in the halls of Europe demanding carte blanche entrance for Albertan fur and threatening to blowup anyone who opposes him.

Not to pull a JK on you, but “Scotch Law” is “proofed,” Scottish Law is “not proven.” Wouldn’t want to allow mere sobriety to be a viable excuse.

I respectfully disagree, Scotty. I think the politically correct term of art is Scots Law nowadays, but Scotch law is respectable and has a long tradition to support it, including among Scottish lawyers, one of whom taught me about it using that term. It is from this aspect of the Scottish legal tradition, by the way, that we get the expression, “he got off Scot free,” which doesn’t mean the accused suffered no approbation from the reasonable assumption he was in fact guilty, merely that there wasn’t sufficient evidence for a court of law to find him so.

Pursuing Mr. Kenney’s illegal residence claims further would put the Federal Liberals in an awkward position right now. It would probably result in an all out war with Kenney, and now that he is a provincial premier and they have to some how try deal with this difficult pipeline issue, I suspect it was decided not to pursue it further. It is interesting how people in positions of power get away with things others wouldn’t these days and the Conservatives and Mr. Kenney are as guilty of it as those they often throw accusations at. Is it any wonder voters are so cynical and angry these days.

Well as long is Mr. Kenney is not so stupid to rent out his new Edmonton accommodation on AirBnb (unlike another former UCP MLA), he should be fine on that issue in the future. Even ole Mike Duffy seemed to wiggle out of the huge double dipping housing scandal he found himself in and when Harper tried to bring Duffy down over it, it worked out Duffy was the survivor instead, not Harper. Obviously the Ottawa housing rules are very flexible and Conservative politicians in particular seem to have no qualms about taking a lot of money most people would feel they are not entitled to.

However, I think Kenney’s greater legal concerns relate to all the shenanigans in the UCP leadership race. There are still ongoing investigations of that one and a lot of things happened there that are questionable and it involved a lot of people, some of whom are facing fines and charges. They may not all be as supportive of Mr. Kenney as his mother was on the housing issue.

Interestingly out of this housing/residence debacle, Mr. Kenney i notice Kenney has something in common with SNC Lavalin, a dubious distinction – they both seem to have made illegal campaign donations. The Liberals and Conservatives both paid back those donations to SNC, which go back to 2011 or so and before the current leaders were in charge of their parties. I wonder if the Ontario PC’s have gotten around to returning the money they more recently received illegally from Mr. Kenney. Maybe that is another Kenney scandal and perhaps a Ford one too.

.. Jason Kenney PURCHASED and ‘lived in’ a condo within walking distance of OUR Parliament buildings.. and the after hours steak houses, beaneries, salad bars, juke joints frequented by elected and unelected ‘public servants’ WE paid salaries and pensions to… You know.. the likes of Andrew Scheer, Ray Novak, Rob Anders, Duffy, Poilievre, Tony the weenie wagger Clement & an ‘environmental’ pylon Minister named Peter Kent. The same feeding places as MainMedia.. and the punditry, lobbyists, and electoral wankers & crankers chowed down at.

Does anyone deny this.. ? That is a black & white ‘YES/NO’ question. Jason Kenney purchased that condo – he lived in it – he sold it. He also declains with ‘he lived as a Senior Minister in hotels’ – does anyone care to dispute that (yes/no) ???

Yes yes.. his mommy & daddy’s place – Calgary .. blah blah woof woof.. looking after them.. and a blue pickup truck.. saving his virginity for the right saintly virgin lady… oh deary me.. horseshit salad & hold the lettuce and tomato, thanks

Death threats to the intrepid journo who dared track Jason Kenney’s expenses sucking greedily on the teat of Canadian taxpayers.. for how many years ?????

RE: The Salamander’s point – Did Jason Kenney claim that the condo in Ottawa was his principal residence when he sold it? Or did he pay taxes on it as a secondary residence? Anyone know?
Maybe Mr. Kenney would like to share his tax reporting for the year of the sale.

Don’t worry, Jason Kenney’s got a ‘blue ribbon panel’ sharpening its razors for you",2019-05-08 01:33:00,David Climenhaga,,"Brace yourselves, people. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has announced his “Blue Ribbon” panel to do a “deep dive” into the province’s books and figure out how to get them into the black in less than three years, eliminate debt, and do it all without raising taxes or introducing a sales tax.

Never mind the ribbon, the emphasis should be on the blue. Because there’s only one way to do what Mr. Kenney is talking about, and it won’t be pretty.


Sweeney Todd, in this case, the demon barber of Fleet Street (Photo: Palm Beach Dramaworks).

I suspect an appropriate name for this group would be The Sweeney Todd. You know, Cockney rhyming slang for something along the lines of Oh My Gawd! This is going to turn out to be like eliminating the mortgage so fast you have to sell the house.

Still, give Mr. Kenney credit, it was a clever piece of political marketing, with the chair of the six-member panel a former New Democratic Party finance minister, which is certain to be noted immediately and many times hereafter by the United Conservative Party Government’s media cheering section, and her vice a former Alberta Liberal.

But don’t worry about that if you’re a die-hard Conservative, they’re the kind of New Democrat and Liberal that radical market fundamentalists can love.

Janice MacKinnon, now a University of Saskatchewan history professor, is a former New Democrat alright, but not really one that can be called a Dipper in good standing if you happen to believe in the sorts of things that normally define New Democrats.

She was long-ago Saskatchewan premier Roy Romanow’s finance minister and her signal policy achievement in 1993 was closing 52 small rural hospitals throughout the province. Saskatchewanians, rural ones in particular, have never forgiven the NDP for this betrayal of New Democratic principles, ironically contributing to the rise and long success of the right-wing Saskatchewan Party.

Truth be told, if you’re serious about saving money in health care, there are really only two options: physician salaries, which aren’t going to be cut, and closing rural hospitals. Well, if Prairie history repeats itself, rural Albertans can’t say they weren’t warned!

How a historian is qualified to make economic recommendations is a question for another day. But if you want to know what Dr. MacKinnon is likely to recommend for Alberta, look no further than her own recent history. To wit, what she has already recommended for Alberta in the company of the University of Calgary’s Jack Mintz, pet economist of Canada’s market-fundamentalist media: Harsh austerity, cutting public sector pay, restructuring health care, and a charming faith in the fantasy that tax cuts for corporations will create jobs.

Vice-chair Mike Percy is now a University of Alberta business professor, but back in the day he was the finance critic of Liberal leader Laurence Decore’s opposition in the Alberta Legislature. That was when Alberta Liberals campaigned against Ralph Klein’s Progressive Conservatives by arguing they were wet, squishy and far too left wing.

Mr. Klein proved them wrong, but Dr. Percy nevertheless would fit right in with Drs. MacKinnon and Mintz. He was an Alberta Liberal MLA from 1993 to 1997, the party’s most right-wing period, and he has been a loud and consistent voice for discredited conservative economic nostrums ever since.

The other members of The Sweeney are:Dave Mowat, former President and CEO of ATB Financial, the Crown-owned Alberta financial institution that Mr. Kenney badly wants to privatize. Mr. Mowat was hired by former premier Rachel Notley to lead the review of the province’s ludicrously low oil royalties that discovered what the fossil fuel industry wants was exactly the right thing for Alberta after all. Who knew? If nothing else, this proved that Big Oil could capture a social democratic government as effectively as a conservative one, not that it helped the NDP much come election time.
Kim Henderson, former deputy minister to B.C. premier Christy Clark as well as a former DM of finance in the B.C. Government. She was fired by the NDP in that province when they came to power in 2017.
Bev Dahlby, a British-trained PhD U of C economist and former International Monetary Fund boffin. In addition to his day job, he is associated with the neoliberal C.D. Howe Institute and the even-more-market-fundamentalist Fraser Institute.
Jay Ramotar, a senior Alberta civil servant who previously was DM of Alberta Health and a former member of the board of the Canadian Council for Public Private Partnerships. In 2013, at least, he was Alberta’s top-paid civil servant, with a salary of $406,379. Come the worst, he’s unlikely to be the public employee taking a haircut.

If you’re a rural Albertan expecting a little down home, school of hard knocks common sense, you won’t find it in this elite collection of well-heeled right-wing academics, a banker and senior civil servants. The only guy who came faintly close in this stage production was Finance Minister Travis Toews (pronounced Taves), the MLA for Grande Prairie-Wapiti and the sole cabinet minister from Northern Alberta, there mainly for decorative purposes at yesterday’s one-man show.

It’s important to remember that the promise cutting taxes for billionaires and corporations will create jobs is guaranteed to fall flat, just like it always does. Look for plenty of stock buybacks by already rich corporations instead.

My guess is the panel will recommend outrageous spending cuts to public services, Mr. Kenney will shave it back by a percentage point or two, maybe to the 5 per cent he’s rumoured to be telling all his ministers to come up with immediately, and we’ll all be expected to be relieved.

Mr. Klein got elected promising big spending cuts. Mr. Kenney started talking that way, then when he realized it might be harder to sell politically than he thought, changed to no cuts and freezing spending at current levels.

If Kenney decides to go back to big cuts now that he has a safe majority for four years, I think a fair number of voters are going to feel betrayed and lied to. I don’t think he can just slide it by, saying well the blue ribbon panel recommended it.

As for Ms. Mckinnon’s proclivity to close rural hospitals, well that didn’t turn out very well politically for the Saskatchewan NDP, did it? They haven’t been in power for quite a while now and that is in a province that was much more inclined to elect the NDP. Mr. Klein was not so politically stupid to do that sort of thing even though he blew up a big city hospital. I don’t think Mr. Kenney will be closing a lot of rural hospitals eithet unless he has a political death wish.

The UCP may feel they have a big mandate, but they don’t have a mandate to make big cuts, whether their blue ribbon panel full of people from out of the province and from the 90’s (some both) realizes this or not.

Well, look at it this way. Pompeo and Notlob are about to start a war with Iran that may well turn into much worse than a regional bombing campaign of murdering Muslims for talking back against white power. While the evangelicals celebrate the likelihood of Herbert W Armstrong’s prophesy of the final battle between Christians and non-believers duking it out in a Middle East armageddon unafraid of the consequences because Jesus will descend from heaven to save us all, practical persons might be somewhat concerned.

The mad dog Yankees are out to force the entire world into submission to be a place like Kenney wants Alberta to be, a capitalist nirvana, but with the Earth itself falling apart as CO2 levels pass 415 ppm and with zero chance for remedial efforts, we may well find that Russia and China say to hell with all this and escalate the conflict. Well past a nasty conventional war. Then the petty idiocy of local Cons, convinced they are of superior human genetic stock and intent on sticking it to the less well-off and rural residents won’t matter a bit.

Albertans will do well at first. When Iran closes the Straits of Hormuz, and knocks off an American aircraft carrier, world oil prices will skyrocket. Never will a barrel of bitumen be worth more. Conservatives will rejoice for a brief moment before the world economy crashes. Misery will be widespread, and even Albertans might look up from a spot of happy navel-gazing to take note of the chaos. It might well be worse than the temporary inconvenience of wildfire smoke from BC ruining outdoor barbecues of a summer.

Because 99.9% of the populace is about as uninformed on world affairs or even local politics as a gopher or the common loon, this catastrophe will come as a major surprise. Fearmongering you say? Really? The writing has been on the wall since at least 2001, more like 1997 when The Project for a New American Century was promulgated by a group of dopes not entirely different in societal makeup than this group Kenney has convened to remake Alberta according to his fundamentalist dreams. Darn, there goes the neighbourhood.

There was a brief respite in the advanced economies, from the kind of hierarchy espoused by Kenney’s masters, from 1945 until approximately 1972, this being a significant anomaly in the status quo of about 1700 until now. Alberta’s experience lagged by perhaps ten years because the province, unlike any other part of Canada, benefited from the creation of the petro-dollar world. Life in North America is going to look a whole lot more dismal for a vast swathe of the population once the Empire loses the battle to keep the Eurasian hegemonic rival from forming. Belt-road is going to remake the world, barring a nuclear conflagration or, more likely, climate-induced fragmentation of the global economy in the post-jobs era. The NDP were literally powerless to do more than rearrange the proverbial deck chairs.

If I can make a couple of suggestions to the panel:
1. Alberta has 34 Members of Parliament. The City of Calgary is able to govern itself with 15 Councillors, and it has one third the population of Alberta; Edmonton manages with 13, with a slightly smaller population. Therefore it stands to reason that the province could get by with a legislature with 40 – 50 MLAs, not 87.

2. Once every couple of weeks or so, the City of Edmonton runs several pages of ads in the Journal (Sun too?) advising people of proposed zoning changes which, I suspect, they are required to do because of provincial legislation. The cost of this has to be brutal.

Running these ads made sense in pre-internet days, but now it would be much more cost effective, and efficient, to have a website for people to look at, and perhaps have people register for automatic notification of something that impacts their neighbourhood. If the province allowed municipalities to quit buying the ads it would allow them to decrease municipal grants a little bit with no pain at all.

David, You’re absolutely right about rural hospitals being the most obvious potential target. Health is the biggest item in Alberta’s spending, and there are really just 2 ways to cut health expenditures in the short term: reduce the number of physicians, and cut the number of hospitals. It’s hard to imagine that many UCP voters consciously voted for either of those measures: hence the “blue ribbon” panel to take the heat. Flash forward to election 2013: “Don’t blame us – we just did what the blue ribbon panel told us to do!”

This would be a good time to reprise your column of February 22, and if I may I will recycle my comment (edited) of February 21: 

“David, excellent point about the rural hospitals. Any comparison of per capita hospital costs between Alberta and other jurisdictions has to be adjusted for the reality that rural hospitals in Alberta, at least since the dawn of the Lougheed era in 1971 were intended for more than health care: they were intended to be anchors to keep people in small towns at a time when rail lines and elevators were closing: they let grandparents in long term care stay close to the family, attracted doctors and nurses to the local economy, and their kids to local schools, provided government-paid construction and maintenance jobs. In short, the hospital building boom in the 70s to the 90s was not for health reasons but rather part of an economic subsidy for rural Alberta. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, by the way, and perhaps a legitimate government expense. But it was not driven by health care needs.”

Apologies: long post coming …

So, here’s the thing about health care: each and every approach taken to date, by governments of every stripe and across Canada—disappointingly, including the recently-dethroned Notley NDP—has attempted, without success, to control costs by throttling services to the people. All that does is lengthen waiting lists and, in some cases, shorten lives.

The only real solutions to the high cost of the health care system involve whole-of-government measures to slow demand for care, by keeping people healthier. For example, seniors with broken hips caused by slips, trips and falls are an enormous cost, from EMS and ER costs, to costly orthopaedic surgery, to often prolonged hospital stays, to the frequent need for continuing care placement in lieu of discharge to their before-injury home. And yet, a modest investment in prevention, through exercise and physiotherapy care, better nutrition, improved management of polypharmacy, and improvements to the built environment—like keeping walking trails and sidewalks clear of snow and ice in wintertime—could dramatically reduce the overall costs of this problem, and free up resources to serve people with less-preventable conditions.

The same applies to the growing epidemic of chronic diseases, like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, all of which are amenable to community health interventions like addressing social determinants of health. A lot of this requires coordinated work outside of what we traditionally consider the “health” portfolio, like municipal affairs and rules about zoning and development, public infrastructure and road and sidewalk maintenance. Issues around personal safety and injury prevention for all demographics are also a major cost driver, so those physicians being criticized for calling for better gun control are most certainly in their lane.

Addressing flaws in the service delivery design of the health care system is also part and parcel of the path to a solution. One major change that politicians are universally afraid to take on directly is to abolish the dysfunctional fee-for-service model for physician compensation, which incentivizes volume over quality and disincentivizes interprofessional team-based care hubs. Optimal management of complex chronic diseases requires a comprehensive client-centred team, including nurses, dietitians, therapy professionals (like PT & OT), social workers, psychologists, pharmacists, and many others; the era of the “lone wolf” family doctor is gone. And yet, while there are pockets of excellence scattered around the province and across the country, most citizens don’t have anywhere near the kind of access to this kind of service that they truly need, and participation by physicians in these kinds of programmes remains voluntary.

Full universal first-dollar coverage for non-physician allied health services, like regulated mental health professionals and physiotherapy, will also work to keep people well and out of the hospital.

Unfortunately, many conservatives, especially “small-government” and libertarian conservatives, assail such measures as “social engineering”, but if we are truly going to constrain health care costs without cutting services to the public—which often leads to political backtracking once the pain starts being felt by voters—we are going to have to bite the bullet and tackle these difficult issues.

We can’t cut costs by closing hospitals and ERs. But we can cut costs by reducing demand for expensive hospital and ER care.

Cutting costs is not the goal. Creating opportunities for “entrepreneurs” to insinuate themselves into a transaction is the goal. It’s well past time to stop using the euphamism “libertarian” in place of the perfectly adequete “kook”. Healthcare is a luxury. People can hang on in the most wretched states, whether morbidly obese, chronically intoxicated, hooked up to oxygen, etc., for a long time. Preventative interventions are for bilingual transgendred communists, whereas health is for the “hard-working”, to coin the Konservative phrase.

I can’t say that I am surprised to see that Mike Percy and Janice McKinnon are a part of this panel. As David C. has stated in his blog, he was the Liberal finance critic and was one of those criticizing the Progressive Conservatives for not cutting hard enough and Janice McKinnon has spent her time as an MLA beating up on New Democrats for being concerned about the state of our public services and not embracing market fundamentalism as professed by the Fraser Institute. She has given lots of talks there as well as go to work for Fraser Institute in disguise-the School for Public Policy at the University of Calgary. I think that a lot of New Democrats view her much the way that Democrats viewed former Senator Joe Lieberman which is with a great deal of suspicion.

Talking about reducing the number of Drs in the province, and closing rural hospitals – because, really, “they’re not needed” is short-sighted and naive. Obviously, those who believe this to be the answer have not had cancer, for example, where they were required to attend radiation and/or chemotherapy treatments every day for 6 weeks, or 3 months. The cost is astronomical (prohibitive) if you don’t live within driving distance of a treatment centre.
I agree that healthcare needs an overhaul – however – before throwing money at – or slicing money from – the healthcare budget, there needs to be some common sense acknowledgement of our societal needs. More and more seniors are in need of care and there simply aren’t resources to do so. This problem is not going away – we are an aging society. We are also not a society in which we have extended families available to take on caregiver roles. Our long-term care facilities are in desperate need of staffing, basic facility maintenance, upgrading and new builds.
Have you tried to access orthaepedic care in our province? It is next to impossible. There are brokers available to help you find private clinics – mostly in Vancouver, BC – who can assist you for $$. Waiting for an orthopaedic consultation in Alberta can take years. Why? And there are those of you who think we need fewer Drs?
I agree that we need more coordination of health care – the PCNs are a good idea – but don’t seem to be easing the wait times much. Those with chronic and complex health concerns – particularly pain management are simply unable to get appropriate care. And that is living in the major cities.
A 20% cut is not what we need. All that does is reduce service levels, increase wait times, and cause injuries and burnouts in the workplace. Do you honestly believe that the ones earning $500,000 a year are going to take a 20% cut? No – it’s the housekeeping staff who make $20,000 a year with no benefits or sick time who take that cut. Again – the rich are protected and the poor get poorer.
And speaking of being poor – it is extremely expensive to be poor – and it’s hard to eat well when you’re poor. Fresh vegetables and fruit, good proteins, milk, and so on is much more expensive than a $5.00 burger meal. When you have money to access services such as physiotherapy, and a nutritionist, and so on – it is much easier to avoid the problems associated with poverty-level existence. Making people poorer is not conducive to reducing healthcare costs.
Bottom line is – if you want a healthy society – one that doesn’t require so much expensive healthcare – then you need to address the societal issues that impact demand.

Please understand that I am not advocating closing rural hospitals. I am stating that there is nothing left to cut but rural hospitals and doctors’ salaries. Everything else has been cut to the bone already. Moreover, Dr. MacKinnon’s most famous policy was … cutting rural hospitals. So there’s at least a high probability she and her “blue ribbon panel” will recommend the same thing here. DJC

As a consequence, we may not all have noticed what’s been happening on Canada’s West Coast.


NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

So the potential significance of the victory in a federal by-election Monday by Paul Manly of the Green Party of Canada in British Columbia’s Nanaimo-Ladysmith riding may not yet be fully appreciated here in Wild Rose Country.

But then, what normal Albertan pays attention to political happenings on Vancouver Island when we’re obsessed with our pipedreams of a pipeline?

We might want to start paying attention, though, because for a variety of reasons the election of Canada’s second Green Party MP may well be a harbinger of things to come. Those things aren’t necessarily going to be good news from the perspective of a province that’s just elected a government committed to undoing all significant limits on petroleum production, carbon outputs, and environmental regulation generally.


Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I know, I know, the United Conservative Party of Premier Jason Kenney pretends to be working on a climate change plan of its own. But the reality, it’s pretty obvious, is a Trump-like strategy of undoing all of the inadequate measures taken by the previous NDP government as quickly as possible and then using a variety of excuses to stave off doing anything effective for as long as possible – or at least as long as profitable.

As has been argued here before, you can have climate change denial without denying climate change. That’s what happens when you deny you’re denying climate change while blocking or stalling all effective measures to do anything about it and encouraging distrust of the entire concept. This is exactly what the UCP has been, and continues to be, engaged in.

This may suit the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and like allies of the Kenney Government, but by God it doesn’t suit the residents of British Columbia’s Coast – as a select group of them were able to make clear on Monday. And whether most Albertans like it or not, they may have something to say about whether we get that pipeline.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Of course several factors led to the outcome of the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election:Genuine environmental concern widespread on the West Coast, including deeply entrenched opposition to the passage of Alberta bitumen through the inland marine waters around Vancouver Island.
The apparent collapse of the Liberal vote in the riding, possibly the result of disillusionment over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s SNC-Lavalin troubles, his increasingly perceived weakness on the environment file, or both.
The pathetic state of the federal NDP and Jagmeet Singh’s unconvincing portrayal of a federal leader.
The personal popularity of Mr. Manly – whose father James represented Cowichan-Malahat-The Islands in Parliament for three terms – who was foolishly dumped by the NDP during the leadership of the former Liberal Thomas Mulcair for his principled defence of the rights of the Palestinian people.
The hard work in Parliament and fondness by Canadians for Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

It’s hard to say, of course, what the most significant factors were in these circumstances, or whether conditions will prevail in a federal election in which the slight majority of Canadians who hold progressive views may be inclined to vote strategically to prevent the election of another Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer with Stephen Harper pulling his strings from Alberta.

But it’s no longer hard to imagine the planets coming into alignment for a Green Tsunami on the West Coast as voters there, disillusioned by unkept Liberal and B.C. NDP environmental promises shift their support to Ms. May’s Green Party.

That could result in a Conservative victory. Or it could leave the Greens, as Canada’s new party of conscience, holding the balance of power in Parliament, a role the NDP thought they had put behind them under Jack Layton and sacrificed completely under Mr. Mulcair’s pivot to neoliberal austerity.


Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the short term, that is bad news for Alberta pipeline advocates, including the ones in Rachel Notey’s NDP and the Alberta Federation of Labour, as Mr. Trudeau moves toward the green part of the political spectrum to avoid his government’s annihilation.

In the longer term, it could be even worse for pipeline promoters if the Greens end up in the position to keep Liberal heads above the rising political tide.

We shall see. In the meantime, Premier Kenney will be working hard, as he promised, to make Alberta look as bad as possible in the eyes of the citizens of other provinces.

On Tuesday, for example, the UCP pulled the plug on the NDP’s plans to create a series of parks and protection areas in the Bighorn Region of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.

Environment Minister Jason Nixon, a big supporter of the ATV users who have been laying waste to the environmentally fragile area, claimed the problem was the consultation process used by the NDP. Of course, the real problem was the Notley Government consulted widely, not just the ATV crowd, which demands carte blanche to destroy whatever they want without limits or controls.

In the eyes of West Coast environmentalists, this may not be as serious an issue as the continued uncontrolled carbon emissions from the Athabasca oilsands, but it will do nicely in the rest of Canada as a powerful symbol of the environmental irresponsibility of the Kenney Government","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">It’s hard to say, of course, what the most significant factors were in these circumstances, or whether conditions will prevail in a federal election in which the slight majority of Canadians who hold progressive views may be inclined to vote strategically to prevent the election of another Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer with Stephen Harper pulling his strings from Alberta.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But it’s no longer hard to imagine the planets coming into alignment for a Green Tsunami on the West Coast as voters there, disillusioned by unkept Liberal and B.C. NDP environmental promises shift their support to Ms. May’s Green Party.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That could result in a Conservative victory. Or it could leave the Greens, as Canada’s new party of conscience, holding the balance of power in Parliament, a role the NDP thought they had put behind them under Jack Layton and sacrificed completely under Mr. Mulcair’s pivot to neoliberal austerity.</p>

<p class=""p1"">In the short term, that is bad news for Alberta pipeline advocates, including the ones in Rachel Notey’s NDP and the Alberta Federation of Labour, as Mr. Trudeau moves toward the green part of the political spectrum to avoid his government’s annihilation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the longer term, it could be even worse for pipeline promoters if the Greens end up in the position to keep Liberal heads above the rising political tide.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We shall see. In the meantime, Premier Kenney will be working hard, as he promised, to make Alberta look as bad as possible in the eyes of the citizens of other provinces.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On Tuesday, for example, <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-bighorn-parks-proposal-cancelled-environment-minister-1.5126389"">the UCP pulled the plug on the NDP’s plans to create a series of parks and protection areas</a> in the Bighorn Region of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Environment Minister Jason Nixon, a big supporter of the ATV users who have been laying waste to the environmentally fragile area, claimed the problem was the consultation process used by the NDP. Of course, the real problem was the Notley Government consulted widely, not just the ATV crowd, which demands <i>carte blanche</i> to destroy whatever they want without limits or controls.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the eyes of West Coast environmentalists, this may not be as serious an issue as the continued uncontrolled carbon emissions from the Athabasca oilsands, but it will do nicely in the rest of Canada as a powerful symbol of the environmental irresponsibility of the Kenney Government.</p>

Dave, I’m a longtime fan going back many years. I’m also a coastal British Columbian. I’ve travelled the Salish Sea with pods of orca and, like many of us, those majestic creatures eclipse any sense of connection we have with any “eastern” province, including Alberta. This may devolve into a clash between two provinces at odds. We already feel a deeper affinity to northern California, Oregon and Washington than we ever will to Alberta. Those are states with our sense of the environment and, on economic importance, they make the Tar Sands appear minuscule.

If Alberta plays the separatist card, it should know it will still be landlocked. I’ve been here 40 years and I’m convinced we would reject overtures from Alberta – out of hand – and we would align instead coastally. They’ve got the biggest companies in the world. You’ve got what, a massive stranded asset and hundreds of millions of unfunded clean up costs?

“… That’s what happens when you deny you’re denying climate change while blocking or stalling all effective measures to do anything about it and encouraging distrust of the entire concept. This is exactly what the UCP has been, and continues to be, engaged in…. “ And, in fact, it is also what the federal Conservatives and Andrew Scheer are doing, which is probably why they’re stalling the release of their official “climate plan” until June—as per their latest comment on this—perhaps thinking its inadequacies won’t get much attention so close to summer BBQ season. One additional lesson from the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election, though, is that over 70% of the votes cast were for parties that accept the urgency of addressing climate change and putting a price on carbon—the Greens, the NDP, and the Liberals—despite their differences in terms of detail and implementation. If this pattern carries across the country it’s the ScheerCons that will be in trouble in October.

Your linked piece from 2017 did miss one additional form of “non-denial denial” vis-à-vis climate change that is often cited by conservatives: Canada is too small a player to make any difference, on a global level, so we shouldn’t have to make any sacrifices to address the issue. Of course, as a G-7 country, we are a major economic player in the world, and if we don’t do anything about climate change, how can we ask less robust economies to do anything?

It’s also worth comparing the quite different results in this week’s byelection with those in the January contest in the overlapping (but smaller) provincial constituency.

Compared to the previous general elections in those ridings, the provincial Green vote collapsed even more dramatically than did the federal NDP’s on Monday. (So far, nobody seems to have done the necessary poll-by-poll comparisons.) To some extent, the provincial boundaries are more NDP-friendly, but that factor only takes us part-way. What’s probably just as important are the very different stakes in the two contests.

In January, the survival of the provincial government was at stake. Had the NDP lost, its legislative grip would have been tenuous at best. This clearly focused the minds of those who might have been hesitating between NDP and Green.

In the federal contest, the outcome had no such potential consequences, so any NDP supporters who had grievances with either the federal or provincial wings of the party could protest harmlessly. Certainly, as a long-time member who has been dismayed at how badly the Horgan government has lurched to the “brown” side, I would have had a hard time not wanting to bloody their noses with a Green protest vote on Monday.

As an example of how badly the BC NDP has lost its way, you only have to read the new CCPA report on the egregious subsidies to the LNG industry – which dwarf the handouts that Christy Clark wanted to give.

I don’t think cancelling parks and protection areas will do anything to enhance Alberta’s reputation with the environmentally minded, but I suspect they have already come to the conclusion Kenney and the UCP will be terrible anyways. I also think they are right about that.

I don’t think it matters much that many Conservatives go around these days claiming not to be climate change deniers (anymore?), when they still pretty much act as if they are. Their climate change policy (if they even really have one) can be summed up as, do nothing or as little as possible, so even if they do actually really believe in climate change, they do not seem to take it very seriously.

However, it took 20 to 30 years for Kenney to get dragged kicking and screaming into partly accepting gay rights, so I would not be surprised if the UCP and Federal Conservatives spend the next 10 years or more fighting another losing battle against climate change initiatives. In the end though, it doesn’t matter much what Kenney thinks, the rest of the world outside of the Alberta bubble is moving on now.

I think in the alternative universe the UCP lives in, the delays in pipelines are being caused by a few troublesome protestors, a few wayward judges or a less than competent Prime Minister. I don’t think they actually comprehend how many people outside of Alberta (and some in Alberta too) are genuinely concerned about climate change. I think the Green Party will continue to increasingly resonate with people in other parts of Canada, perhaps at the expense of support for the Federal Liberals and the NDP.

It is possible in the short run vote splitting between the Greens and the NDP or Liberals will benefit the Federal Conservatives, but I do not think Scheer will be any more effective in their pipeline battles than the previous Federal Conservative Harper government was, maybe even less so. The world has changed, Conservatives and Alberta risk falling further behind by taking comfort and wallowing in the platitudes of the world of the past.

Although critiques of the UCP’s positions on climate (if one can call them that) resonate with me, I worry that the overrating prospects their ultimate defeat may offer false comfort. They do seem at times to fall victim to their own insularity, their provincialism. Andrew Nikiforuk published a sardonic piece that turned alt-right memes on their hand, observing, as he did, that the petroleum industry in Alberta were acting “triggered”, thin-skinned, the snowflakes of industry.

On the other, although one cannot bargain with the laws of thermodynamics, this does not make their “defeat” inevitable — if, for example:* they can just drag us through the rapidly closing window for which climate-change mitigation (prevention/minimization) is a significant option, into a new landscape in which adaptation is the only game in town.
* chaos proves to be an environment to which fascism is better adapted than are either democracy or progessivism.

Here’s wishing they’re wrong on all counts.

184,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,UCP Health Minister Tyler Shandro hesitates over risky ideological plan to pull plug on medical ‘Superlab’,2019-05-10 00:50:00,David Climenhaga,,"When it opted to build a $590-million “Superlab” in Edmonton, Alberta’s former NDP government was relying on sound advice from the Health Quality Council of Alberta, which recommended medical lab services be consolidated under “a single public sector platform.”

But never mind the HQCA was set up under legislation created by a previous Conservative government to get itself out of a political jam caused by the never-ending crisis in health care that’s been the hallmark of Conservative rule in this province since Peter Lougheed left office in 1985.


Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro (Photo: Government of Alberta).

That certainly didn’t stop Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party, which is now the government of Alberta, from accusing the NDP for basing its decision on “ideology.” This was blatant nonsense, of course – and ironic too, since it is the conservative movement that is now dominated by rigid economic dogma, much of it shown repeatedly not to work very well, in Canada and around the world.

So throughout the recent Alberta election campaign, Mr. Kenney and the UCP vowed regularly to kill the Superlab project if they won the election. Characteristically, the NDP hid its light under a bushel and never really responded effectively to the constant UCP talking points about “risky ideological experiments” and the like.

The UCP’s opposition to the the Superlab may have been driven in part by bitterness that the NDP’s capable health minister, Sarah Hoffman, had quickly dumped a weird Tory scheme to privatize the whole operation for $3 billion over 15 years to an Australian corporation no one had ever heard of and which had no history of doing business in Alberta. Talk about a risky ideological experiment!


Former Alberta health minister Sarah Hoffman (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Regardless, when a UCP majority was elected on April 16, work stopped at the Superlab site before the new government had even been sworn in.

Thus it was mildly surprising to hear Health Minister Tyler Shandro sounding a bit like one of the grownups yesterday and expressing reservations about the UCP’s knee-jerk ideological reaction. He even sounded like he might consider it risky, telling reporters at the Legislature that the government has only “paused” construction and that it’s now “a matter of doing due diligence and find out what the consequences will be when looking into being able to cancel that.”

Is he saying Mr. Kenney had no idea what the consequences would be when he made his risky ideological promise? Presumably, yes, although Mr. Shandro can be forgiven if he doesn’t want to phrase it exactly that way.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

It presumably remains likely the government – deeply committed to its ideology of privatization, which is known to increase costs and remove public accountability – will pull the plug on the project.

But since the UCP will probably be looking for private “partner” to run it, they may now be seeking ways to keep construction moving so our public investment can be transferred for a song to their private sector friends. Certainly, something will have to happen if medical lab services are going to keep on being delivered to a population that continues to grow. We’ll probably have to wait a little to see if that’s what’s going on.

Mr. Kenney himself, one suspects, doesn’t really care. He’s already busy campaigning for his next job, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada as soon as Andrew Scheer manages the difficult task of losing this fall’s election to the rudderless Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals.

After that, the new Alberta premier will move right on to campaigning for the next job he covets, that of prime minister of Canada.

So as long as Mr. Kenney remains at the helm, the UCP will advocate the right policies and make the right talking points to keep his generous donors and supporters sweet – including major media, think tanks and corporations that have the ability to wiggle around election financing laws.

In the event something goes wrong, someone else will be left to wear the egg on their bespoke suits and sort out the mess long after Premier Kenney has left for pastures that are greener in every way except the one that matters","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Perhaps the UCP is having second thoughts about some of their rash promises. I suspect that particular silly one on the lab facility cost them a seat or two in suburban Edmonton and didn’t gain them anything elsewhere – most of the rural ridings they would have won anyways. I doubt if people there even paid much attention to that promise.

Now they have a mess, a self created one that they have to try and fix without seeming to backtrack too obviously. I suspect they will rework things a bit, somehow privatize it and then continue on with construction once they get the cost off the government books. Perhaps they will be smarter about it than the old PC’s were with their 3 billion contract to a company from Australia no one here had ever heard of. A piece of good political advise, not sure if they are inclined to take it, this time buy local. If it is going to be a sweetheart deal to some company, have it be one from here in river city not some faceless unknown multinational.

I think we should soon start a pool on how long Kenney will stay as Alberta Premier before he jumps ship back to Ottawa. Off the top of my head, I would say two years and eight months. I have a feeling Scheer will find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. He is already talking about moving the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, all he has to do now is go on a foreign trip and lose his luggage. A tip for Scheer, if he is inclined to take good political advise – avoid India, it is very hot this time of year.

Private lab was tried in London England, someone I’m associated with went to University there and worked there. The private lab didn’t work so they went back to Government labs. Research needs to collect data a year in advance to determine the strain of flu vaccine a year in advance and private labs fall short. Good luck to us all and Kenney with his private lab.

I suspect the decision to pause construction on the very day of the election was made by someone in the bureaucracy, without political direction, simply to avoid additional costs being put into a project that might very well get scrapped in a matter of weeks. If the UCP backtracks on this bad idea and allows construction to proceed after all, less harm done than if it had continued full-steam ahead and then they shut it down later.

181,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"Stephen Mandel, as impudent as ever, pleads for public subsidy for his Alberta Party",2019-05-13 02:37:00,David Climenhaga,,"Hello, Alberta! Stephen Mandel here! My Alberta Party didn’t manage to elect a single MLA last month, but we’re good guys and we got 9.1 per cent of the vote. How about you give us some money?

That wasn’t really Stephen Mandel saying that, of course. It was me, your blogger, David Climenhaga. Writing stuff like that is one of the things you can get away with if you’re a blogger and not, say, a member of that endangered species, the newspaper reporter.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney … you want what? (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But, seriously, that was basically what Mr. Mandel was saying at the end of last week. I’m not making this up, either. I read it in the Edmonton Journal.

“We deserve to have some form of government funding,” he told the Journal’s reporter, seeing as about 170,000 Albertans cast their ballots for the Alberta Party on April 16 but didn’t manage to elect any MLAs, “in order to allow us to represent those people.”

Well, you’ve got to give the old guy points for sheer brass. He says he’s going to write a letter to Premier Jason Kenney, whose United Conservative Party just won the provincial election pretty darned convincingly, making the case for the dough.

As Mr. Mandel well knows – having had a successful career in municipal and provincial politics, serving as mayor of Edmonton and a Conservative cabinet minister – that’s not how our “single member plurality” electoral system works or, more importantly from the perspective of the people who advocate forcefully for never changing it, how it’s supposed to work.

It’s commonly called first past the post because, you know, the winner in a given riding is only the one that gets past the post first. (It’s a horse race metaphor, people. Don’t worry about the fact there’s no literal post.)

Mr. Mandel would have had a better case if he had argued for a system of proportional representation, in which every party with a vote over a certain threshold – say, 10 per cent – gets to send a proportionate number of MLAs to the Legislature. (Wait! Better make that 9 per cent. — Ed.)


Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper (Photo: Remy Steinegger, Creative Commons).

Canada needs proportional representation, but large parties like the UCP and for that matter the NDP nowadays, although they ought to know better, don’t like it because it prevents the creation of massive majorities on less-than-majority votes. That said, let the record show your blogger understands the UCP would have won a majority even with PR based on the vote it received on April 19.

Mr. Mandel would also have a better case if he were calling for tight election financing rules plus per-vote subsidies to all parties that contested elections, even tiny ones with little chance of electing anyone, based on the number of ballots they received. We used to have this in Canada and it worked well.

As I am sure Mr. Mandel knows, the Conservative Party of Canada led by Stephen Harper, whose government included Mr. Kenney as a senior cabinet minister, campaigned hard against that idea as a gross misuse of Canadian taxpayers’ money and had eliminated it completely by 2015.

Mr. Harper complained the subsidy amounted to an “enormous cheque that just keeps piling into political parties every month whether they raise any money or not.”

In reality, such subsidies were anathema to Conservatives because they helped their enemies.

Canadian Conservatives, as in the United States, favour a system of wide-open funding in which the richest can influence voter behaviour most effectively. But even without some limits on fund-raising, Canadian Conservatives are frankly good at raising money and you can hardly blame them for wanting to preserve that advantage.

But don’t assume just because of that Mr. Kenney and the UCP won’t reverse course completely on the idea of a subsidy for the Alberta Party – if not for the Alberta Liberals (1 per cent) or the Alberta Greens (0.4 per cent).

  <p class=""p1"">Hello, Alberta! Stephen Mandel here! My Alberta Party didn’t manage to elect a single MLA last month, but we’re good guys and we got 9.1 per cent of the vote. How about you give us some money?</p>
<p class=""p1"">That wasn’t really Stephen Mandel saying that, of course. It was me, your blogger, David Climenhaga. Writing stuff like that is one of the things you can get away with if you’re a blogger and not, say, a member of that endangered species, the newspaper reporter.</p>

(Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">But, seriously, that <i>was</i> <i>basically</i> what Mr. Mandel was saying at the end of last week. I’m not making this up, either. <a href=""https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/were-optimistic-stephen-mandel-to-push-for-provincial-funding-after-alberta-party-thumped"">I read it in the Edmonton Journal</a>.</p>
<p class=""p3"">“We deserve to have some form of government funding,” he told the Journal’s reporter, seeing as about 170,000 Albertans cast their ballots for the Alberta Party on April 16 but didn’t manage to elect any MLAs, “in order to allow us to represent those people.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Well, you’ve got to give the old guy points for sheer brass. He says he’s going to write a letter to Premier Jason Kenney, whose United Conservative Party just won the provincial election pretty darned convincingly, making the case for the dough.</p>
<p class=""p3"">As Mr. Mandel well knows – having had a successful career in municipal and provincial politics, serving as mayor of Edmonton and a Conservative cabinet minister – that’s not how our “single member plurality” electoral system works or, more importantly from the perspective of the people who advocate forcefully for never changing it, <i>how it’s supposed to work. </i></p>
<p class=""p3"">It’s commonly called <i>first past the post</i> because, you know, the winner in a given riding is only the one that gets past the post first. (It’s a horse race metaphor, people. Don’t worry about the fact there’s no literal post.)</p>
<p class=""p3"">Mr. Mandel would have had a better case if he had argued for a system of proportional representation, in which every party with a vote over a certain threshold – say, 10 per cent – gets to send a proportionate number of MLAs to the Legislature. (<i>Wait! Better make that 9 per cent.</i> — Ed.)</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" id=""attachment_30469"" style=""width: 262px;""><img width=""252"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-30469"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-30469"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Harper-2-252x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Harper-2-252x300.jpg 252w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Harper-2.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-30469"">Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper (Photo: Remy Steinegger, Creative Commons).</p></div>
<p class=""p3"">Canada needs proportional representation, but large parties like the UCP and for that matter the NDP nowadays, although they ought to know better, don’t like it because it prevents the creation of massive majorities on less-than-majority votes. That said, let the record show your blogger understands the UCP would have won a majority even with PR based on the vote it received on April 19.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Mr. Mandel would also have a better case if he were calling for tight election financing rules plus per-vote subsidies to all parties that contested elections, even tiny ones with little chance of electing anyone, based on the number of ballots they received. We <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_political_financing_in_Canada"">used to have this in Canada</a> and it worked well.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As I am sure Mr. Mandel knows, the Conservative Party of Canada led by Stephen Harper, whose government included Mr. Kenney as a senior cabinet minister, campaigned hard against that idea as a gross misuse of Canadian taxpayers’ money and had eliminated it completely by 2015.</p>
<p class=""p5""><span class=""s1"">Mr. Harper complained the subsidy amounted to an “</span>enormous cheque that just keeps piling into political parties every month whether they raise any money or not.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">In reality, such subsidies were anathema to Conservatives because they helped their enemies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Canadian Conservatives, as in the United States, favour a system of wide-open funding in which the richest can influence voter behaviour most effectively. But even without some limits on fund-raising, Canadian Conservatives are frankly good at raising money and you can hardly blame them for wanting to preserve that advantage.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But don’t assume just because of that Mr. Kenney and the UCP won’t reverse course completely on the idea of a subsidy for the Alberta Party – if not for the Alberta Liberals (1 per cent) or the Alberta Greens (0.4 per cent).</p>
<p class=""p1"">After all, there’s a pretty good case to be made that the Alberta Party is better at stealing votes from the NDP than from the UCP, so why not scoot a little public cash their way?</p>

We come here today, not to praise the Alberta Party, but to bury it… or some such thing.

I used to vote Green in federal elections simply to ensure their popular vote numbers stayed above 4% simply so they could receive the minimum amount of funding, not because I believed I had a hope in hell of ever electing a Green MP.

I too admire Mr. Mandel and his supporters’ fortitude in demanding back what his confreres stripped away not long ago: recognition and support for minority viewpoints in the form of tax subsidies for parties that receive significant popular support even if that doesn’t translate into electoral success.

Unfortunately, in engineering their own double reverse hostile takeover (HT to DJC) of another party, the former PCs who run the Alberta Party turfed a young, successful, respected and ELECTED leader in favour of somebody who was none of those things and lost their shirts.

Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, as they say, so for the former PC brain trust that couldn’t get their way in either party, I say: how do ya like them apples?

Climenhaga excerpt: ‘UCP would have won a majority even with PR based on the vote it received on April 19.’

My guess is that the PCs and Wildrose leadership would not have been able to get the members approval to unite if the AB NDP had brought in proportional representation. The Wildrose base would not have been able to resist supporting Prop. Rep. because of the prospect of one day being the dominant ruling party in proportional representation coalition politics. And a lot of PCs would have supported Prop. Rep. and their independence because they are repulsed by the extremist ideology in the social conservative base of the Wildrose, re: choice, GSA’s and religious school funding, etc.

A centrist PC party might have just as likely made common cause in a coalition this spring once the votes were counted with NDP, Liberals, AB Party, Greens, rather than with the Wildrose social conservatives extreme RW ideology. ‘

And the NDP probably would have had reasonable odds, like the PCs, to be the biggest member of a coalition gov’t option. Calgary and Edm voters would have given Wildrose very few seats. And PCs could have retained some rural seats.

And Lib’s/AB Party/Greens would all have done better underp prop. rep. because very little strategic voting would have happened. I’m guessing a lot of Liberal voters went NDP.

The NDP was wiped out, from 16 seats to zero, in 1993 even though Klein and Decore Liberals left the NDP with 11% of the vote, which in theory could have given the NDP 8 seats under a prop rep. system. And with the Liberals economic pro-corporte austerity ideology basically just Pepsi to Klein PCs Coca-Cola, and no NDP voice left in the legislature, it was open season on social services/education/environment under Klein for the rest of the 90s.

NDP should have considered that history. And the fact that for the next 2 decades the NDP never won more than 4 seats. Prop. rep. offsets the marginalization of historically smaller parties under single member plurality.

Oh well, my hindsight is of course 20 – 20 as they say.

And on the other hand, there is that other saying: Those that don’t learn from history…

I’m a bit surprised to still hear from Mr. Mandel now, but I guess its not like there is a big line of people wanting to take over the leadership of the Alberta Party.

It will be interesting to see how Kenney reacts to Mandel’s plea for money. On the one hand, conventional wisdom is that the Alberta Party may take votes away from the NDP, so it might be politically beneficial for Kenney to throw them a bit of a lifeline. Personally, I’m not convinced this is really the case and I think a more successful Alberta Party could be more a long term threat to the UCP than the NDP. On the other hand more conservative parties also seem to be firmly against providing taxpayer monies to losing political parties, particularly when it is not them.

I think Kenney will likely either just ignore Mandel’s request or just say no. If Mandel is lucky, Kenney may not gloat too much and not totally rule it out immediately. Mandel might even get a more diplomatic “we’ll consider it”, with no urgent or specific timeline for a reply or decision, which probably means no anyways. Perhaps in one sense the Alberta Party is fortunate to still have Mandel, he probably doesn’t need a paying job anymore at stage of his life, because I think it may not be easy for them to come up the money to pay their leader for the next few years.

At some point in time the former PC’s who now control the Alberta Party will start to disappear from the political landscape, but they seem to be lingering on sort of much like their predecessors the Socreds did for a very long time after they lost power. Not quite ready to give up yet, but not really that relevant anymore. However, if the Alberta Party wants to have a future, they are going to need to put a lot of effort into renewal soon and that probably starts right at very the top.

This is the party with the leader that did not file his paperwork on time and technically should not even been able to run in the election, now you lost but we should give you money, it would be funny if it wasn’t politics. Hey I didn’t get a seat for my party which hasn’t submitted any paperwork either, where’s my money!!

178,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,The Annals of Justice: Vice-Admiral Mark Norman gets an apology and Conrad Black gets a pardon,2019-05-16 01:13:00,David Climenhaga,,"Remember this important fact: None of us knows whether Vice-Admiral Mark Norman is guilty of the crime with which he was charged.

Well, Vice-Admiral Norman knows, presumably, and his legal team would have a pretty good idea, as would a few Crown prosecutors and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.


A close-up of the plaque on display in Arlington National Cemetery, from, I kid you not, the author’s private collection (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As for the rest of us Canadians, though – including the Members of Parliament who made this murky saga even weirder by voting unanimously on Tuesday to apologize to the vice-admiral and his family “for what they endured over the course of his breach of trust case, which collapsed last week,” as the Globe and Mail put it – all we have are opinions, most of them uninformed.

On the part of the Liberal Government’s opposition in Parliament, all of the mainstream media, and the usual suspects on the Trudeau-hating right, these opinions are strongly held – so just stating the obvious truth is likely to spark outrage.

Nevertheless, it is unavoidable. The breach of trust charge against Vice-Admiral Norman was stayed last week. And, according to LawFacts.ca, a legal resource website published by Legal Aid Ontario, luckily not an institution of which the vice-admiral needed to avail himself, “the decision by the Crown to stay or withdraw charges means they discontinue the prosecution.”


Actor Peter Sellers as Chance the gardener (Photo: Library of Congress).

“However, there is one important difference,” LawFacts.ca explained. “Stayed charges can be ‘brought back to life’ within one year of the day they are stayed. While this tends to be rare, you should know that if you’re charged with new offences during the one year period after you’ve had charges stayed, the stayed charges could be brought back and the Crown could prosecute you on those same charges again.”

Even when charges are withdrawn, meaning they cannot be brought back again, this simply means that prosecutors have reached the conclusion they cannot get a conviction from a court in a legal system that operates from a presumption of innocence requiring the state to prove all charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

In a confusing situation like this, when much of the essential information is either a military or cabinet secret, this imperfect result is more akin to the famous Scotch Verdict, discussed in this space before: Not proven.

This is not to say Vice-Admiral Norman is not the victim of an injustice. He may well be. Only that we don’t really know, and will likely never be allowed to know.


Conrad Black, AKA Lord Black of Crossharbour (Photo: Canadian Film Centre, Creative Commons).

It must be noted that, had the accused had been a poor person, a person of colour, or a member of a minority religion, many of the same people who donated to Vice-Admiral Norman’s GoFundMe account with the encouragement of Conrad Black, would now be screeching that he “got off on a technicality.”

And if he were an accused terrorist railroaded by a foreign country’s drumhead kangaroo court with the active assistance of Canadian officials who ignored the accused’s constitutional rights, the din would be almost unbearable, I imagine.

In this regard, the whole affair reminds me of the scene from the movie Being There, in which Louise, Chance the gardener’s former housekeeper, observes, “It’s for sure a white man’s world in America. … Yes, sir, all you’ve gotta be is white in America, to get whatever you want.”

In fairness, Louise also observed in this scene that “I raised that boy since he was the size of a piss-ant. And I’ll say right now, he never learned to read and write. No, sir. Had no brains at all. Was stuffed with rice pudding between th’ ears. Shortchanged by the Lord, and dumb as a jackass. Look at him now!” This is a description that may be more fittingly applied to Justin Trudeau or Andrew Scheer than Vice-Admiral Norman.

It must also be noted that, had this been a normal case involving a normal citizen instead of a senior naval officer comfortable in elite society, the MLAs who ran screaming to the press during the trial would have mumbled that they couldn’t comment about a matter that was before the courts. However, when powerful men are involved, apparently the normal law of political gravity is repealed.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (David J. Climenhaga).

Which brings us to the topic of Jason Kenney, the former federal minister of defence now premier of Alberta, who we are told took supposedly exculpatory evidence to Vice-Admiral Norman’s lawyers at the very last moment, thereby allowing him to take credit for the circumstances under which the vice-admiral was able to skate.

Wouldn’t it have been less expensive for taxpayers and much easier on Vice-Admiral Norman and his family, who had to endure so much, if Mr. Kenney had gone to the RCMP or the prosecutors immediately with his exculpatory memories? It’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t have returned a call from a former minister of defence on such a topic.

Failing that, Mr. Kenney certainly could have just phoned one of his friends at Postmedia and dominated the front pages of their newspapers for a few days.

I wonder why he didn’t? Surely, it couldn’t have been because by withholding the information until the last minute he was able to cause maximum damage to the government of the prime minister whose job he covets.

So I wonder, now that we’re in an apologetic frame of mind, if Mr. Kenney could also be persuaded to apologize to Vice-Admiral Norman for causing him unnecessary pain by delaying?

And I wonder if Parliament will be passing any more unanimous votes of apology in the event charges are dropped against other Canadians, let alone if cases come to light in which less-well-connected citizens appear to have been railroaded by police and the courts into undeserved prison sentences.

How likely do you think that is?

Pardoned by the president, Lord Black may now exit the Dominion at last

Speaking of Lord Black of Crosshabour, known lately for rambling hagiographies polishing the tarnished reputation of the current U.S. president in both a turgid doorstopper and his apparently unedited column in the National Post, I see President Donald Trump has at last returned the favour and expunged the former newspaper magnate’s 2007 criminal convictions south of the Medicine Line.


U.S. President Donald Trump (Photo: Gage Skidmore, Creative Commons).

In a letter yesterday from the White House, a symbolically appropriate venue under the circumstances, Mr. Trump heaped encomia on the former Canadian citizen still resident in this country and pardoned His Lordship for the three counts of fraud and one of obstruction of justice for which he served three and a half years in a federal prison in Florida.

It seems churlish to suggest this is another example of the phenomenon described by Louise the housekeeper in the passage above, yet the conclusion is inescapable.

Well, it may turn out to be an event unique in recorded history: the first time a convicted felon has been granted a full pardon by a future convicted felon.

At any rate, Lord Black is now free to travel to the great Republic to the south and, as another famous American president might have put it, fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that he will do so soon.

Ret’d Commander Ken Hansen is not impressed by Norman’s behaviour at all. Norman was once a student of his. You can watch an interview from Halifax on Monday May 13 here and decide for yourself. He goes into how Norman could have been disappeared bureaucratically without involving the RCMP, all without so much fuss. He calls Norman’s actions a breach of trust.

As for Black, one supposes that as he is no longer a convicted non-Canadian, he can legally be a refugee in Canada, or whatever ruse harper used to allow him to stay here since 2012.

Lord Almost had to renounce his Canadian citizenship in order to park his backside in the British House of Lords. As a convicted criminal and non-citizen why was he allowed into Canada much less permitted to set up shop in Toronto all these years?
Lucky him. Now he can slide down to Mara Lago or whatever it’s called and goof around the golf course with his orange head buddy.

“ …None of us knows whether Vice-Admiral Mark Norman is guilty of the crime with which he was charged… “ Well, no, not with certainty. But, based on the information that has been, until now, publicly available, there is quite a bit of doubt about whether what he was charged with doing was even a crime at all. One of the elements of the charge of “breach of trust” is a personal benefit: the accused must obtain some tangible personal gain out of the alleged breach for it to be an offence. All of the known facts about V/Adm Norman’s case would tend to suggest his actions were related to a desire to see the naval supply vessel project proceed in contravention of Cheops’ Law … http://www.cynical.ws/murphyism/Cheops'_Law. So, he is not guilty because no crime was committed.

Why the Crown chose to stay the charge, rather than withdraw or seek a dismissal in court, is likely just hedging, in case new evidence emerges that could change the picture. But, given that the Minister of National Defence has stated that the government will pay Norman’s legal bills—which must be substantial, given the heavy hitter he hired as his defence lawyer (Marie Henein, she of the Jian Ghomeshi case)—there must be a wide consensus in Ottawa that he is innocent in fact, and not just in theory, full stop.

Fortunately for the Federal Liberals, the Norman affair which the Conservatives have been working hard to manufacture into a big scandal, does not seem to be anywhere near what SNC Lavalin was. Perhaps a bit of government bungling, but it is not at all clear the PMO had much to do with it, as some of the more virulent Trudeau hating Conservatives were trying to portray. However, even though this now seems to be heading in the direction of conspiracy theories, it could still be somewhat politically damaging as some people will believe the worst about their political leaders. Alternatively it could just fade away as an issue and leave the Conservatives looking a bit deranged or desperate if they try to beat this fading horse too much.

One does wonder why it took so long for Mr. Kenney and other Conservatives so long to come forward with information in support of Mr. Norman. The only legitimate reason I can think of was Mr. Kenney was rather busy and preoccupied furthering his own political career. The most likely reason, is he and other Conservatives were waiting to see which way the wind was blowing before tying themselves too closely to Mr. Norman. It would be quite politically embarrassing to be tied to someone if they was a good possibility of them being convicted.

Mr. Black’s time spent in writing that nice book about Mr. Trump seems to have been well rewarded. You can say what you want about him, but he does seem to have a knack for ingratiating himself with very powerful conservative politicians and it has often worked well for him in life. He is a very clever guy, perhaps he was too clever for his own good at times. The prisons are full of such people. However, the ones that are rich and white enough usually don’t stay there that long and eventually find some path to exoneration or redemption.

176,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Postmedia bid for role in UCP ‘war room’ illustrates the folly of Trudeau’s lifeline for failing newspapers,2019-05-18 03:08:00,David Climenhaga,,"Connect the dots, Mr. Prime Minister! That newspaper industry bailout package you’re foolishly planning in the name of preserving democracy is principally designed to keep a corporation afloat that will do anything, no matter how unethical, to destroy your government.

If you want proof, look no further than Postmedia’s astonishing admission, revealed on Twitter yesterday by my sharp-eyed colleague Dave Cournoyer, that the corporation has signed up a well-connected Conservative lobbyist to persuade Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party Government to let it be part of its $30-million “war room” fake news and harassment operation.


Former Kenney campaign manager turned lobbyist Nick Koolsbergen (Photo: CTV).

The one-sentence bombshell spotted by Mr. Cournoyer was in the province’s Lobbyist Registry, which Postmedia apparently assumed no one would bother to check. The Toronto based, largely U.S. owned media corporation founded on the crumbling bones of the once proud Southam newspaper empire has hired former Jason Kenney campaign director Nick Koolsbergen to “discuss ways Postmedia could be involved in the government’s energy war room,” the filing said.

The newspaper corporation’s assumption likely would have been justified had we been forced to rely on professional journalists to stay abreast of things. Mr. Cournoyer, who is an independent blogger, got almost no credit for his efforts when his discovery became a story yesterday.


Toronto Sun editor-in-chief Mark Towhey, once Toronto mayor Rob Ford’s chief of staff (Photo: Twitter).

There is an amusing irony in Postmedia’s bright idea. As humans have understood from the dawn of civilization, no one should expect to get paid for something they’re willing to give away for free.

And whatever Mr. Koolsbergen has been asked to whisper in the ears of his former bosses at the UCP, Postmedia has been enthusiastically acting as an unofficial communications auxiliary for Alberta’s new governing party since the day the Alberta NDP was elected four years ago, if not for nothing, then for scraps.

Now, by the sound of it, Postmedia has concluded its openly partisan efforts in the service of the UCP deserve to be rewarded.

Postmedia, caught in a trap of its own devising, feebly claimed its lobbying only has to do with the efforts of its “commercial content area,” not news. This strains credulity considering both the open biases of its Canadian newsrooms and the past political activities of former board member David Pecker, notorious for his “catch and kill” strategy of using payoffs by his U.S. news corporation to bury scandals that threatened President Donald Trump.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But even in the unlikely event Postmedia speaks the truth, after a fashion, this is no excuse. The intentional blurring of real news and paid “commercial content” – essentially paid advertisements disguised to look and sound like news – is a deplorable trend that is as much a part of the story of legacy media’s steep decline as the ravages of digitization and technological change.

Meanwhile, in its national news coverage, Postmedia is as dedicated to the destruction of Mr. Trudeau’s government just as it was of former Alberta premier Rachel Notley’s.

A day never passes that the same UCP-Postmedia stenographers who openly campaigned against Ms. Notley don’t also attack Mr. Trudeau, often in the same breath, as the frequent references to the imaginary Notley-Trudeau alliance in the recent election campaign illustrated.

Mark Towhey, once unruly Toronto mayor Rob Ford’s chief of staff, a man said to be without journalistic experience, was recently hired by Postmedia to carry on this work at the Toronto Sun. As Postmedia’s Alberta websites and newspapers did with Mr. Kenney, the Toronto Sun also played a key partisan role in the election as Ontario premier of Rob’s brother Doug along with his chapter of Canada’s Conservative Axis of Intolerance.

Now, Postmedia is actively campaigning to make federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer prime minister of Canada. Local Postmedia papers with a streak of independence soon receive their marching orders from corporate headquarters in Toronto, as is well known.

And yet Mr. Trudeau’s Government persists with its plan to put the legacy newspaper industry on publicly funded life support, which has been intentionally designed to exclude new and alternative media and which, by merit of the literally failing newspapers Postmedia owns, will principally benefit that company.

You mean, Postmedia isn’t already involved in Alberta’s ‘energy war room’?
What a joke. Every last one of Postmedia’s pundits is already an oil industry cheerleader. Postmedia doesn’t have one pro-environment, anti-fossil fuel, climate activist writer on staff.

Day after day, Postmedia’s scribblers regurgitate the same talking points from CAPP, Vivian Krause, and Ethical Oil. Banging the drum for new pipelines. Attacking environmentalists and ENGOs. Trumpeting First Nation support for “development” while sidelining indigenous opposition. Ignoring climate change. Flouting IPCC warnings.
The onslaught is non-stop.
What more could Postmedia possibly do?

It appears Mr. Koolsbergen has pulled a sneaky little end around the lobbyist cooling off legislation. The legislation requires premiers’ staff members to sit on the sidelines for six months before taking on lobbying work, but by leaving Kenney’s employ before Mr. Kenney became premier, Koolsbergen is exempt. It satisfies the letter of the law, but not the spirit.

‘No Laws Were Broken’ appears to be becoming a mantra.

Perhaps it is time to apologize to George Clark for his misspelled coup d’état. It appears to have been completely successful on both the provincial and federal levels. In both cases the Ab NDP and the Trudeau Liberals have effectively provided public financing for the Con project’s propaganda and activist arms.

BTW, in your previous post you correctly noted that having an official opposition will do little or nothing to stop the UCP’s “radical agenda.” So why did the Ab NDP fail to bring the change they promised when they had the power to do so? Adjectives like feckless, innocent, trendoids, all come to mind. So Alberta is back to being an authoritarian single-party petro-state. Less of a coup and more a reversion to the mean.

I agree Mr. Trudeau’s plan seems dumb from a political point of view. It sure hasn’t earned him any better coverage in the press in the last six months, if anything it is much worse. However, I suppose therefore it is 100% defensible by Trudeau – he can plausibly say “see my plan has had no influence on their coverage”. I think the National Pest is like many other large failing or struggling businesses in past history, there is a lot of political pressure on governments to somehow prop them up. This is entirely consistent with what the Liberals have done in other cases (ex. Bombardier) and also with what the Conservatives have also done (ex. GM), although thy are more hypocritical about it, as are the Post newspapers who often complain about support for other struggling businesses or groups. It is tempting to say in this case the smart political strategy would be to just let nature take its course, but the Trudeau Liberals have certainly proved themselves not to be very smart political strategists over the last few years, which is a big reason they are in the pickle they are in now. They have had many fine sounding ideas, but implementation of anything has not been their strong point.

Now, welcome to Alberta where Premier Kenney is a much better political strategist. He brings up this war room idea in the campaign, with no mention of support to the National Pest leading most voters and others to assume this would be some sort of internally run government communications thing, not a P3. Now his former chief of staff magically recently pops up at the National Pest and the war room idea is fleshed out by them to involve money to them safely after the election. How clever and convenient. Even more clever, if too much outrage arises, Kenney can still treat this as a trial balloon and credibly disavow it because this came from them not him. Now do you think the Journal, Herald and Sun will be running many columns to protest this, or even many stories to cover it? They best way to prevent any possible uprising of public outrage is to just ignore the story as much as possible.

I must give Kenney credit here, he seems to have come up with a much more blatant and politically clever scheme to provide some support to the media that mostly blatantly supported him in the last election and yet who gets criticized for this idea? Trudeau, of course!

EXCERPT: Koolsbergen’s lobbyist registration also indicates that Postmedia received more than $1.5 million under the Canadian Periodical Fund, a federal program designed to help Canadian publishers “overcome market disadvantages.”

Last year, Ottawa announced $595 million over five years to support struggling media providers in Canada. This means Postmedia’s Content Works division could run advertorials on behalf of Kenney’s war room against environmentalists, while its news division is supported by funding distributed by the Trudeau government.

In the service of making what is a curse to many citizens appear to be a blessing they tend to be faintly Orwellian as well. That is, they often say the opposite of what they mean with a little artificial sweetener sprinkled on top.


Lieutenant Governor Lois Mitchell reading the Throne Speech yesterday (Photo: Chris Schwarz, Government of Alberta).

Yesterday’s first Throne Speech from the United Conservative Government of Premier Jason Kenney, elected on April 16, was quite typical in this regard.

There was precious little actual news in it, mostly just market fundamentalist nostrums, unachievable promises from the campaign trail, and assignment of blame for their inevitable failure, reheated together in the Legislature’s rhetorical microwave.

Indeed, the news was mostly in the gaps or between the lines. Sure, the carbon tax will be gone in a week with revenues already collected rolled into general revenues. But what will happen to the thousands of job-creating projects the tax was funding? No information.

Stand by for “tough fiscal decisions,” Mr. Kenney told reporters in a news conference before the speech. “There will have to be some reduction in the overall size of the Alberta public sector,” he said.


Speaker Nathan Cooper (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If you were paying attention during the campaign, though, you’d heard most of the speech before. If you weren’t, you’re not likely to pay attention now, are you?

Some credit should go to the anonymous author of yesterday’s effort for at least making it sound as if it were written by a grownup. This is a significant improvement from the Throne Speeches of the late Progressive Conservative Era, which often sounded as if the task had been handed to someone’s bright 11-year-old niece or nephew. This grownup tone is an unacknowledged tribute to the practice of the former NDP Government.

Had the speech been written by one of my past undergraduate journalism students, I would have given it a B+ were it not for the unfortunate effort at springtime poetry in the opening lines – which, translated, in effect meant, “Nyaa-nyaa da boo-boo, we won!”

Lieutenant Governor Lois Mitchel provided a clear and professional reading, as befits her role as a vice-regal personage, with only a few understandable stumbles. Her gentle correction of newly elected Speaker Nathan Cooper’s mispronunciation of “lieutenant” was subtly done, as if she were just enunciating unusually clearly, avoiding hurt feelings. I am confident Mr. Cooper, who is known to be a bright spark, will not say lootenant ever again.

As a service to readers, I have provided accurate translations of some of the more tendentious passages from the speech in italics after each quote. Readers should feel welcome to provide their own translations of other passages in the comments section. No swears, please.

When they say … they really mean …

“Recognizing that our province is beset by severe external political and economic constraints, and consequently saddled with serious internal fiscal challenges requiring urgent action …” (Everything we used to say was the NDP’s fault isn’t our fault!”)

“A relentless focus on policies designed to create jobs, growth, and economic diversification.” (We’re going to cut taxes for rich people and do whatever the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers tells us.)

“Making life better for all Albertans, by ensuring the quality and effectiveness of our public services, especially in health care and education …” (You’re getting choice! We’re going to privatize a whole whack of public health care and education.)

“Bill 1, as promised, will be the Carbon Tax Repeal Act. In providing $1.4 billion in tax relief, it will make everything more affordable for Albertans.” (You won’t notice a thing, just like you never actually noticed the carbon tax.)

“Strengthen the rights of Albertans within unions.” (Unconstitutionally weaken unions so that you get paid less and have fewer rights.)

“Economists estimate that this (business tax) reduction will generate 55,000 new full time jobs, and increase the size of our economy by $12.7 billion.” (It’ll be about as successful as it was in Oklahoma. But don’t worry, we’ll blame someone else.)

“A commitment to curriculum reform, based on proven pedagogy that teaches essential knowledge needed to achieve foundational competences …” (We’ll repackage the NDP’s curriculum reform, the one we called too ideological, and call it a huge improvement. Thanks for the idea, Mr. Trump!)

“In a world where the demand for energy will continue to rise, Alberta can, should, and will be one of the largest suppliers.” (That stuff we said on Page 1 about diversification? Forget it. We’re going with Drill! Drill! Drill!)

“The political forces standing in the way of this inevitable destiny today are external and temporary.” (We plan to blame Quebec and British Columbia, plus Justin Trudeau and the Tides Foundation, for any promises we can’t keep. As for doing anything about climate change, forget that too.)

“A public inquiry into the foreign sources of funds responsible for the campaign to landlock Alberta’s energy.” (This is how we’re going to blame them. The inquiry’s mandate will not extend to foreign funding we like, like the Koch Brothers cash machine.)

“My government will take action to address climate change with … a Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction Fund.” (Forget controlling carbon outputs, we don’t really believe that climate change stuff anyway. We’re bringing back the carbon capture boondoggle!”)

“A great tradition of ordered liberty.” (Order for you. Liberty for us. “Guided democracy” is next.)

“It is our duty and our destiny to renew Alberta’s role as an economic and political leader within Canada.” (I, Jason Kenney, will be prime minister of Canada soon.)

<p class=""p1"">Some credit should go to the anonymous author of yesterday’s effort for at least making it sound as if it were written by a grownup.

<p class=""p1"">Lieutenant Governor Lois Mitchel provided a clear and professional reading, as befits her role as a vice-regal personage, with only a few understandable stumbles. Her gentle correction of newly elected Speaker Nathan Cooper’s mispronunciation of “lieutenant” was subtly done, as if she were just enunciating unusually clearly, avoiding hurt feelings. I am confident Mr. Cooper, who is known to be a bright spark, will not say <i>lootenant</i> ever again.</p>

Throne speeches do often have an upside down quality about them.. Where they are clear and consistent with what the party has already said, you usually need to worry the least. Where they are vague or an odd new word or phrase pops up, something big or unexpected is being quietly planned, so hold onto your hats folks!

Perhaps we shouldn’t totally underestimate Kenney’s ability to surprise, but I think he is more inclined to focus on what we expect rathet than go off on some big unexpected tangents.

He was fairly good at making difficult or things not possible sound easy on the campaign trail, but governing is always more grounded in reality. Those that promise too much often dissapoint. Remember the Canadian politician who promised jobs, jobs, jobs – well his honeymoon was short and voters soon started to fall out of love with him even though he won over 50% of the vote. More recently the gradually diminishing number of supporters for another politician are stiil waiting for him to build the wall and make Mexico pay for it. Of course he has blamed many for his not being to implement his rash promise, but it was his promise he was foolish to make, not theirs. After the summer of repeal, perhaps UCP supporters can look forward to the winter of disappointment.

.. Whew !! You got it like a wood chipper takes the downed branches.. ‘The Throne Speech’ – what a quaint term.. All hail King Kenney.. perhaps that can be refined or redefined.. or mined.. We look at Kenney as a political animal that was not electable as PM in Ottawa.. but with the advent of an evangelical Ottawa / prairie boy grifter like Andrew Scheer, one has to wonder. We found the drone speech overripe with frothy verbsge tricks.. long breathy preposterous pompous posturings & self congratulatory preenings.. reality is.. Kenney et al have doen ZERO – NOTHING – NADA .. Can’t wait for Licia Corbella et al to scuttle from their fantasy world.. proclaim the wisdom of the king.. Oh ! What’s that ?? Poor Licia is still aground on her deluded hysterical voyage of opinion.. caught upon the large island of Andrew Leach.. oh deary me.. her ship ‘Revisionist Hystery’ was holed by an offshore Alberta rock.. locally known as ‘Fact’ .. and lies wounded, hard ashore, sails a flappin.. she is faintly heard shrieking ‘the island must move.. give way I say.. give way !!’

Its a horror movie that makes itself.. Alberta should hang her head in shame.. and then get real.. get mean, get the conundrum of resource extraction & beyond belief pollution figured out. Alberta is at the beck and call of foreign owned or driven ‘Energy Interests’ .. they are not your friends.. or friends of Canada.. Can you hear this Alberta ? Hello hello.. Alberta.. are you out there ? Heloo.. hell.. he.. … Alberta goes Walkabout …

Aside from Alberta producing itself into lower oil prices, “drill baby, drill” means farmers and ranchers get their land stolen, water wells contaminated with toxic chemicals, and will be left holding the bag for the cleanup of abandoned wells and facilities. Even better for the libertarian types, it means the Legislature can be counted on to overturn any troublesome Court rulings that favour landowners and curb the impunity of the energy sector.

Kenney/UCP says this: ‘“In a world where the demand for energy will continue to rise, Alberta can, should, and will be one of the largest suppliers.”’

Compare that rosy speculation by supposed ‘conservatives’ to actual conservatives at the Bank of Canada warning about ‘fire sale’ prices for oil/gas assets.

https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/16/news/bank-canada-warns-fire-sales-carbon-intensive-assets-could-destabilize-financial

Excerpt: ‘The shift to a low-carbon economy is “underway” and sectors like oil and gas, as well as the banks that loan money to them, are exposed to risks from climate change that could spill over into destabilizing “fire sales,” the Bank of Canada said Thursday.’

Forecasts that consider renewables, EVs, are generally bearish…like this piece yesterday: https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/22/opinion/canada-betting-climate-failure

Thanks for the link, Sam. Something that needs to be kept in mind when talking about speed of technology change is the fact that most vehicles will be replaced in 10 years, so that could wind up being the conversion timeline.

I think the path of conversion will be similar to what we have already seen in the conversion to digital cameras. The first purchasers did so to be the first on the block to have one; the next wave happened when people heard about the advantages, then the final wave happened when hard core film users found they could no longer buy film.

One important difference is the fact that most people who converted had a working film camera that they put aside, so there was probably some procrastination involved in their switch. Compare that to someone buying a car in the next decade; they have to buy because their existing car has reached the end of its working life so there won’t be the same procrastination. People purchasing a vehicle in 2024 will want to consider the possibility that gasoline won’t even be available when their new car is ten years old.

Bob on the farm there will have to be huge changes if there is no gasoline by 2034. At present there are electric tractors built by companies like Fendt but they will only run for 5 continuous hours on a charge. During seeding and harvest most equipment runs for a minimum of 10 hrs. and on good day many more. Farm machinery depending on the farm isn’t always replaced every 10 years. I have 2 grain augers mounted on old Oliver combine chassis that were built in 1959 that are used all the time. My Versatile 895 4 wheel drive tractor was built in 1982 and has just over 5200 hrs. on it. It still runs like a top and should last another 4-5000 hrs. with proper maintenance.

I do agree the in Urban settings the use of EV’s will certainly become more popular but the chances of all internal combustion engines being gone by 2034 and there being no gasoline available are 0. Enjoy your day.

Hi Brian,

In the film analogy I presented, I was one of the film diehards. I got many beautiful slides of wonderful scenery in spectacular light conditions. The beauty of slides was when I got something worth of enlarging, I could show the slide to the processor and insist they get the same exposure on the enlargement.

The end of film for me came when I got a great shot of my wife getting out of our tent with a lovely rainbow behind her. Under exposing the scene by a stop produced wonderful colour saturation, but still caught by wife’s (tolerant) smile. I took the best slide in for enlarging, and they couldn’t get it. Turns out they took a digital scan of the slide, then found they could either get my wife’s face and wash out the rainbow, or get the rainbow and leave my wife’s face too dark to recognize.

That was when I realized I was wasting time and money with film which was getting ever more difficult to find, since anything I got was being run through the digital process anyway. Two thousand 1980’s dollars worth of perfectly working camera equipment went into the garbage.

Now, back to the future. I am envisioning a bank of solar cells charging your tractor’s batteries, when conditions are good, and the grid when they are not. (I have enough of a farming background to know what an issue fuel cost is.) The five hour run time you described is not an issue since it only takes a couple of minutes to change batteries. If enough farmers go this route, and for free fuel many will, there simply won’t be enough demand for fossil fuels, especially gasoline, for it to be a viable business. Your augers will wind up with my camera equipment, or you will simply replace the gas motors with electric ones.

Now to get really pessimistic.

This assumes there even is an agricultural industry in Alberta in 2034. One of the ways climate change seems to be manifesting itself is in the increased likelihood of developing polar vortices, that locks a weather system into a spot for longer and longer periods. We saw it this February with a cold spell that would not quit, last fall with snow in September and October, and last summer that created the conditions for the BC fires. The climate changes we have already seen are probably permanent; the objective of reducing emissions is to prevent things from getting even worse. As such, it really isn’t difficult to imagine things worsening to the point that crops fail more often than they succeed. All it would take is a super vortex at some point in the growing season to either create conditions that are too wet to put a crop in in the spring, too dry to grow in the summer, or too wet to get it off in the fall.

For the life of me I don’t understand why the segment of the population that is most vulnerable to the devastation climate change can bring is also the most resistant to trying to prevent it.

Enjoy your day too. I did enjoy reading about your old machinery.

A couple of quick thoughts Bob as it is a busy time of year. You suggest the battery could be changed in a few minutes on an electric tractor. I did a little googling and in one article on Realagriculture about the new Fendt electric tractor, a Fendt engineer says a battery large enough to power its new 1000 series 500 horsepower tractor for 12 hrs. at 50% load would weigh 15 tonnes, so I don’t think you would switch that out in a few minutes without specialized equipment if it could be switched out at all.

A quick response to your assertion that I am against preventing climate change(not that I am)is not possible but I will make a few points. As a cattle farmer I can produce beef on land that really isn’t suitable for crop production, I can rotate forages into my crop production which is good for the land and I can diversify my business by not just having grain production. So when I read countless articles on how we should eat less meat I certainly get my back up. Plus living in an area that has been farmed by my family for 113 years gives a person some realistic context on what has and hasn’t changed over that time period. Successful farming is about adaptation and that is what we will continue to do. Enjoy your day Bob.

Yes, we can expect Jason to blame Rachel and her godless union friends like me with everything that has gone wrong. We can also look forward to the usual crap from the wonderful Sun and Postmedia telling those of us who belong to a union why we are responsible for hindering progress. We can look forward to more natural disasters like this forest fire in High Level and the government won’t do anything to help mitigate against them because the science isn’t settled. In short, we will have to prepare for another government to come along and undo the mistakes that this government will make.

It was so nice to run into my favourite blogger today, but sad that has been so long I wasn’t sure it was you! Maybe we can have a proper visit some day

The most interesting thing about the Throne Speech was the delay in producing a budget until the fall and only after consultation. I expect they will skew consultation responses to allow their friends to insist on massive budget cuts all in the name of balancing the budget and service delivery be damned. Also expect that services will be farmed out to the private for profit sector so that Alberta can pay more for less cause that meets the UCP market driven focus. And the UCP has the gaul to complain about dangerous ideology of others.

Unlike other ‘conservative’ governments I suspect that the UCP actually have a plan to privatize virtually everything and the will to actually follow through.

Once the finances are ‘taken care of’ then I expect that they will discover that social conservative issues are too important to ignore as they will now have the ‘enemies’ clearly defined.

It is going to be a tough four years.

It is only May. The leaves on most of the elm trees on my street in St. Albert have not even appeared yet. In other words, it’s barely spring. God only knows what things will be like around here by midsummer. Smoky, I imagine.

Well, get used to it. It gets harder by the day to deny the reality of global climate change. One of the effects of this inconvenient fact on Alberta’s part of our planet is that there are going to be more frequent and more severe forest fires – the kind that destroyed large swathes of the town of Slave Lake in 2011, Fort McMurray in 2016, and which are now threatening High Level.

“Fire driven weather is ‘new reality’ for Canada and elsewhere, expert cautions,” said the headline on the news summary of an episode yesterday of The Current, CBC Radio’s daily news analysis program hosted by Anna Maria Tremonte.

Ms. Tremonti’s interview with Ed Struzik, author of Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future anda fellow of the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy, was playing on the car radio as I drove to work. Fire-caused weather that results in dynamic, fast moving fires is “the new reality,” Mr. Struzik was saying. “We saw it in B.C. in the last two years, and Alberta the year before, Waterton National Park. Ontario got hit hard last year. I think this is what we’re going to be seeing more of every summer.”


U.S. commentator and public figure Bill Moyers (Photo: Gage Skidmore, Creative Commons).

Pine beetle infestations that have killed vast swaths of trees in this region, another manifestation of global warming, have left explosively dry dead forests in their wake, compounding the problem.

Mr. Kenney’s response to this situation is to pretend it isn’t happening. Oh, sure, he and members of his government make pro forma acknowledgements of global climate change from time to time, but their actions and intentions belie them.

This includes, of course, their Trump-like efforts to dismantle all of the inadequate measures taken by the previous NDP government to reduce Alberta’s massive carbon footprint. Alberta oilsands extraction operations alone add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere than the entire economies of British Columbia and Quebec combined.

Bill 1, An Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax, was introduced in the provincial Legislature on Wednesday and will take effect on May 30. A federal carbon tax will likely replace it, although Mr. Kenney has vowed to fight that in the courts. The position of this bill atop of the government’s radical agenda is intentionally symbolic and tells you everything you need to know about where Mr. Kenney really stands on climate change.


Author and fellow of the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy Ed Struzik (Photo: Twitter).

Premier Kenney also intends to fight measures to ameliorate climate change in the court of public opinion. In the fall he plans to travel to his native Ontario to campaign against the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and install another climate-change denying Conservative government in the nation’s capital.

Conveniently for Mr. Kenney, the federal Elections Act doesn’t prevent provincial governments from intervening in a federal campaign, although he claims he won’t use Alberta government resources to campaign against the Liberals. This much is possible, of course, since Mr. Kenney is widely thought to have his eye on Mr. Trudeau’s job himself, and it might make sense for him to let federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer lose in 2019.


CBC Reporter Anna Maria Tremonte (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Scheer, whose energy policies are drawn from the same playbook as Mr. Kenney’s and Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s, has his own answer to stories like the CBC’s interview with Mr. Struzik. Back in 2016, he promised that if he became prime minister, he’d shut down the CBC’s news division. Easy-peasy, that solves the problem of stories about global warming!

Writing in the Guardian on Wednesday, the 84-year-old American journalist and commentator Bill Moyers lamented the shameful job U.S. news organizations do covering global climate change, the greatest crisis of our age.

“The Goliaths of the U.S. news media, those with the biggest amplifiers – the corporate broadcast networks – have been shamelessly AWOL, despite their extraordinary profits,” wrote Mr. Moyers, who was press secretary to U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. “The combined coverage of climate change by the three major networks and Fox fell from just 260 minutes in 2017 to a mere 142 minutes in 2018 – a drop of 45 per cent. …”


Former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

He compared that unfavourably to the efforts of “Edward R. Murrow and the young men, none of them yet famous, Murrow hired to staff CBS Radio in Europe on the eve of the Second World War.”

“These reporters spread across Europe as the ‘phony war’ of 1939–40 played out, much like the slow-motion catastrophe of global warming plays out in our time,” Mr. Moyers wrote. “They saw the threat posed by the Nazis, and they struggled to get the attention of an American public back home exhausted and drained by the Great Depression.”

Well, there’s no danger of anything like that happening in Alberta.

“Alberta’s public sector unions back doomsday anti-oil campaign,” screeched former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith in a column typical of the drivel published on this topic by Postmedia, the U.S. controlled corporation that dominates media in Alberta.

“It simply doesn’t follow that catastrophe awaits humanity with an additional 1.5 degrees more,” insisted Ms. Smith, who nowadays hosts a right-wing talk radio show. “The record shows that humanity has proven remarkably resilient and adaptable to climate change. There’s no reason to believe that will stop.”

Think of climate obstructionism in Alberta today as a three-legged stool. Postmedia and commentators like Ms. Smith are one leg, the Kenney government is another, and fossil fuel industry lobby groups are the third.

<p class=""p1"">This includes, of course, their Trump-like efforts to dismantle all of the inadequate measures taken by the previous NDP government to reduce Alberta’s massive carbon footprint. Alberta oilsands extraction operations alone <a href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/16/news/oilsands-polluted-more-entire-economies-bc-or-quebec"">add more carbon pollution</a> to the atmosphere than the entire economies of British Columbia and Quebec combined.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Conveniently for Mr. Kenney, the federal Elections Act doesn’t prevent provincial governments from intervening in a federal campaign, although he <i>claims</i> he won’t use Alberta government resources to campaign against the Liberals.

<p class=""p1"">“It simply doesn’t follow that catastrophe awaits humanity with an additional 1.5 degrees more,” insisted Ms. Smith, who nowadays hosts a right-wing talk radio show. “The record shows that humanity has proven remarkably resilient and adaptable to climate change. There’s no reason to believe that will stop.”</p>

Mr. Kenney’s commitment to go campaign federally in Ontario for the upcoming election should give some cheer to the Federal Liberals. It should give them a boost of a few points wherever he goes, nothing like someone from another province coming in to tell Ontarians how to vote. Between that and the Ford PC’s recent bad news budget, which should also remind Ontarians why they may not want Conservatives in Ottawa too.

Of course, Kenney’s helping/not helping campaigning comes with the ulterior motive that he may want the Federal Conservatives not to win this time, so he can jump back into the big pond in an opportune moment in a few years. One gets the sense there will be a lot more out of province travel for him in the next few years and he will not be as interested or focused in running Alberta as in other things.

The wildfires are sure not helpful to the climate change deniers or do nothings message. As it becomes clearer reality is in conflict with their ideologically driven, make believe view of the world, it will get harder and harder to convince people, even in Alberta, that theirs is still the right course. Another reason why I feel Kenney does not plan to stick around here for the long run. The going for the UCP may get a lot tougher than most of their supporters think. Alberta’s economic challenges are not going to go away and the world will not go back to what it was before either.

Excellent blog post. Nobody will listen of course, because it’s inconvenient to have to face reality. After the Alberta smoke, perhaps a dose of BC smoke during the summer will make things even smoggier, but the yipping fools of the right and the lemmings who voted them in for jobs at any cost but with offshored profits will not admit anything. We need foreign investment to help poison ourselves, say these brass intellects.

Federal NDP is calling out Postmedia…EXCERPT: ‘In his letter to Morneau, Angus called on the minister to ensure the tax measures are not used to prop up “government-led communications efforts on behalf of one industry.”

“If Postmedia is acting as a vehicle for paid propaganda content for a particular government and industry, it would make a mockery of the notion of independent journalism and should not be entitled to taxpayers funding,” reads the letter.’

Might have been nice to have the revenue from the carbon tax to deal with the firefighting bills. We know a carbon tax in Alberta or Canada for that matter isn’t going to affect the global climate, but the revenue would be nice especially if it was in Alberta’s coffers rather then Ottawa’s. Ironically Kenney seems opposed to equalization payments a government he was a part of put in place but is more than happy to send Ottawa carbon tax revenue. I’m sure they will send it all back to us.
This really demonstrates the view Kenney and his ilk have for our province, that is a short term view and then move on. I find it sadly amusing the support conservatives get in rural areas where most have a closer tie to the land than in urban areas. You can’t just pick up your land and move perhaps you should try voting for someone who respects this. As long as the chickens keep voting for colonel Sanders they will continue to get deep fried.

Ms. Smith and her friends notwithstanding, the trend is unmistakeable. Wikipedia reports, “The 2018 California fire season was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record with a total of 8,527 fires burning an area of 1,893,913 acres, the largest amount recorded in a fire season according to the California Department of Fire Protection as of December 21.”

Under the NDP’s climate plan, AB’s oil & gas industry emissions would continue to climb year after year.
The oil & gas industry GROSSLY UNDER-REPORTS its emissions (of all types). The Notley govt did not acknowledge the discrepancy, much less address it.
Govt figures for oil & gas industry emissions are FICTION. Actual figures are much higher.

As Canada’s most recent National Inventory Report indicates, AB’s emissions show NO SIGN of falling:Year: 1990…2005…2012…2013…2014…2015…2016…2017…Change (%) 2005 to 2017
GHGs (Mt): 173…231…261…271…276…275…264…273…18%
https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/sources-sinks-executive-summary-2019.html

The oilsands industry is far closer to AB’s fraudulent cap than govt and industry let on.
Total oilsands emissions including projects that are under construction, have received approval, or are seeking approval “blow well past” AB’s fraudulent cap. (Pembina Institute)

NDP or UCP. When it comes to GHG emissions, Albertans have no real choice. Notley took emissions reductions and our inadequate Paris targets off the table.
Notley’s signal achievement was to “push country-wide support for pipelines from 40% to 70%.” Something Kenney could never do. (And she’s still at it.)
Notley acolytes now embrace an essentially denialist position. Something Kenney could never achieve.
Notley’s denialism and pipeline push, supported by a wide swath of progressives, created the political space for Kenney to move AB further and faster towards climate disaster.

Whether we go over the cliff at 100 kmh or 50 kmh, the result is the same.

Specific events cannot be linked to climate change. Suggesting so is disingenuous. Climate change may lead to increased wildfire risk, but given insufficient data (would need thousands if not tens of thousands of years’ data) the baseline risk is unknown.

The Boreal is actually fire adapted. Specific events may not be directly linked, but trends certainly can be. And we do have tens of thousands of years of data from prairie lake sediment deposits. Counting pollen types and volumes along with some elementary chemistry has given us a good picture of climate since the last ice age. Ice core samples from the Antarctic and else where have given us similar information going back hundreds of thousands of years. Here is a rather cheeky take down of denialists which serves as a lead in to some basic chemistry and the role of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Higher temperatures, drier conditions, heat waves, earlier springs, more rapid snow melt, more precipitation falling as rain and less snow, more mountain pine beetles infestations, more dead trees, and more lightning inevitably lead to longer fire seasons and more intense fires.
What more do we need to know?

Doug Brown wrote: “Specific events cannot be linked to climate change.”

Warming is a contributing factor to the frequency and intensity of wildfires, regardless of ignition mechanism. In a warming world, more intense wildfires is what we would expect to see.

Scientists now do attribution studies, in which they determine the incremental effects of climate change as distinct from natural causes.
“Fingerprinting involves rigorous statistical tests of the different possible explanations for a change in some property of the climate system.”
(Skeptical Science)

Scientists have recently identified one or two events (e.g., a 2017 marine heat wave off Australia) that would have been “virtually impossible” without human influence.
“Climate change was behind 15 weather disasters in 2017” (Washington Post, Dec 10, 2018)

In general, scientists are careful not to attribute single weather events to climate change as the sole or primary cause. Rather, climate change is a contributing factor.
Global warming is the climate on steroids. Warming loads the dice for extreme weather events.
Warming amplifies extreme weather events, even if they begin naturally.
Meaning more intense, frequent, or prolonged floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, storms, and other extreme weather events.

“How climate change is making B.C.’s wildfire season hotter, longer, drier” (The Narwhal, Aug 13, 2018)

“‘Attribution’ can be done for specific events. This basically compares how often an extreme event of a particular magnitude and duration occurs in climate model simulations both with and without human emissions of GHGs. This was first done on the 2003 European heatwave. So it can be done, but is heavily dependent to the event you analyse, the spatial scale on which it occurs, and even the climate models and experimental set up you use.”
“Analysis of Pope Francis’ Encyclical Laudato Si” (Climate Feedback)

“A discussion with experts on California wildfire links to climate change” (Climate Feedback)
https://climatefeedback.org/discussion-experts-california-wildfire-links-climate-change/

“The field of ‘extreme event attribution’ has indeed become much more prominent in recent years. This is a result of a combination of better modeling and analysis tools, plus a longer period of observed climate data from which to draw conclusions. While it is not possible to make these kind of attribution claims for all types of extreme weather events, it is increasingly true that this has moved from the margins to the relative mainstream of climate science.”

Mr Brown: No, you’re correct, but only to the extent that you can’t necessarily attribute any one fire or flood to climate HD age. But you can attribute the increasing frequency and severity of hugely destructive wildfires and overland flooding to a warming global climate.

It’s analogous to the relationship between risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like smoking, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and an individual’s risk of heart attack. You can’t take population-level statistics that describe who is at higher and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and point a finger at one individual and tell them if they will or will not have a heart attack. But, for example, if you take two groups of 10,000 people each, one group all daily smokers and the other all lifetime non-smokers, you will see two to three times more heart attacks amongst the smokers group than in the non-smokers group.

Yes, there have always been wildfires, and floods, and hurricanes. But we will see more of each of them, and more severe and destructive events, as the global average temperatures continue to climb. And, yes, the global climate has always been in flux, with average temperatures rising and falling over time. But, there are two significant differences that make the current situation more urgent: one is the speed of change, with the global climate now changing rapidly, within one human lifetime, instead of over many millennia as in the past; and, for the first time in the 4.5 billion years of the Earth’s existence, there is a species living on the planet—us—which is not only the principal cause, but with the capacity, if it chooses to, to do something about it.

We can debate how to take action, how rapidly to undertake the measures needed to mitigate the problem, and how to accommodate the economic needs of the people most affected by those measures; but in my view, to simply deny that we need do anything at all—as Conservative politicians across Canada and around the world have been doing—is irresponsible.

If there were only three legs, it would have toppled over when the NDP took one away for repair. But it didn’t because there are actually four legs of climate-change obstructionism or denial—that is, including the Alberta electorate.

As Premier Notley discovered, her relatively slight adjustment of the government leg did nothing to change widespread climate-change denial among voters who made that amply plain in the recent election when the UCP garnered over 60% of the so-called ‘popular vote.’ Instead, her tiny shortening of the rate of increased bitumen production only made the stool a little tippy— but limping like a bison calf for the singling-out by wolfish partisanship. (Maybe the Soldiers of Odin will have to show JKKK the barroom trick of putting a matchbook under that tippy leg.)

The fourth leg now handed back to the UCP makes the ‘everybody’s-out-to-get-us’ chapter of Alberta’s official climate-change denial narrative sound pretty solid. But like it is when trying to level chair or table legs, it might take a few sawings to stop it from wobbling completely.

Self-interest naturally prejudices perspective which, from the circled wagon laager’s point of view—one of narrative’s most durable tropes which Albertans have successfully cultivated and demonstrated once again—is really very little perspective at all: looking out from the within the laager’s ‘event horizon,’ it’s easy to convince that enemies abound on all sides of the singularity. That milk-stool on which vested interests milk the tarry bitumen and political redoubters bilk True Believers hardly contemplates the bigger picture, but it’s all their ilk need to know.

If there’s another way to address the climate and fossil fuel relationship, it’s not in the UCP’s hymnary: this is Armagetumin. Bitumen is the one true god and dilbit its only profit. The Righteous believe in Rapturous Salvation while the enemy is consumed by real fire now threatening to encircle the locus of this great Revelation. The backdrop could not be more convenient as summer winds fan political tinder, nor a scape goat be more handy—they’re everywhere.

The trouble with this sort of Jihadist POV is of course its myopic omissions of larger truths which reveal bitumen braggadocio as overblown and incite false accusations against neighbours, federates and allies who live in the larger community outside of the wagon laager and its milking stool—especially problematic when the list of “enemies” contains “freinemies” who are actual customers of the low-grade petroleum of the bitumen mines: the most immediate market for bitumen products, while not the biggest, is still very big, but as well the wealthiest, most powerful in the world. Yet it is characterized with enmity, BC and Quebec supposedly doing America’s bidding in keeping the goo from being bought up by further-flung nations which are as unethical as those which currently supply them with “unethical,” but superior-quality (and sometimes even cheaper) oil.

Meanwhile Jason KeKKenney, Scott Moe, D’ohFo and Andrew Scheer are content to adopt, virtually verbatim, the rhetorical bile of our southern neighbour which they otherwise accuse of maligning Alberta so viciously (meaning, within the mythical laager, all of the Alberta Umma).

The irony blesses the encircled laager just in time for the approaching election in Canada, one of Alberta’s enemies, re: carbon taxes; today’s Court of Appeal decision in BC, another of Alberta’s enemies, re: TMX, conveniently twists the issue of our times like a pall from flaming forests and towns over floodwaters choked with the jetsam of tornados, the flotsam hurricanes, and the odd pipeline leak; the perfect rhetorical storm is already underway—again, conveniently for the UCP government—in the USA, another of Alberta’s enemies, re: manipulators of dilbit ‘discount’ prices, where its own 2020 federal election, with its much longer campaign period, is also just catching fire, as ‘t were.

The milking stool is firmly planted with optimal stability for the dilbit export industry’s self-styled ‘do-or-die’ fight approaching. Only one leg can possibly make it the least bit tippy, public and news media opinion—but so little of it is printed, at least inside the laager, and probably not enough of it read there from social media (this’ll be the source of outside news and opinions which will, as always, reveal that Alberta is not really surrounded by enemies out to destroy it).

But, right now, the Alberta government has three more legs to stand on, anyway. True Believers do not prime their muskets with, nor rest them upon conventional truths and negotiable solutions.

“Killing the provincial carbon tax is one political promise that will be better to break,” the Journal’s four-member editorial board piously intoned.


Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau (Photo: Twitter).

Not that this is an unreasonable sentiment on its face. Given the federal carbon tax that will likely soon replace the provincial version about to be axed by Mr. Kenney’s United Conservative Party government, it’s true enough, as the editorial’s authors opined, that “there are no advantages to be gained that would justify the bureaucratic nightmare of switching from one carbon tax to another slightly different one.”

But surely even the great minds of the Journal’s editorial board understand that Mr. Kenney would be laughed out of the room if he reneged on this promise just now. Even die-hard Alberta New Democrats would have chuckled.

Now consider the collective wisdom of the members of the board on April 13, mere hours before the provincial election that brought the UCP to power.

On the topic of the carbon tax, they argued that while it might have been a “gutsy” play by the NDP, it didn’t work. “Rachel Notley’s carrot approach on the pipeline file was a well-meaning endeavour but it failed to produce results. Now, it’s time to try the stick.”


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Now is the time Alberta, and by extension the rest of Canada, should be capitalizing on that resource to help bankroll a greener future,” they reasoned, rather illogically if one considers the carbon footprint of the oilsands, but whatever.

After heaping praise on Mr. Kenney, the Journal’s editorialists concluded: “On Tuesday, voters should choose the UCP.”

Whether or not they were influenced by the efforts of the Journal’s editorialists, Alberta’s voters in their wisdom took their advice.

Now, consider the timing of these events:

Former Alberta premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

On May 17, it was revealed by a sharp-eyed Edmonton blogger that Postmedia, the corporate owner of the Journal, had signed up a well-connected Conservative to lobby the new UCP Government to let it be part of its promised $30-million “war room” fossil-fuel public relations operation.

By May 18, critics of Postmedia were pointing out there is something remarkably wrong with the notion of a corporation with its hand out for a bailout from the federal government’s $600-million plan to put the legacy newspaper industry on life support to also be lobbying for a job in the ministry of propaganda of a political party opposed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and all his works.

By the May Long weekend, which immediately followed, the story had grown sturdy legs and was being reported in similar terms nationwide.

On May 23, Thursday, the National Observer – the independent online news site that does a better job of covering the Canadian fossil fuel industry than all of Postmedia put together – reported that NDP Ethics Critic Charlie Angus had written Finance Minister Bill Morneau to argue “Postmedia’s potential participation in the war room should disqualify it from government support, since it would make a mockery of independent journalism.”

On May 24, the Journal’s editorial appeared, apparently a lone, brave, independent voice calling on the UCP not to kill the carbon tax after all.

<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">“</span>Killing the provincial carbon tax is one political promise that will be better to break,” the Journal’s four-member editorial board piously intoned.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Not that this is an unreasonable sentiment on its face. Given the federal carbon tax that will likely soon replace the provincial version about to be axed by Mr. Kenney’s United Conservative Party government, it’s true enough, as the editorial’s authors opined, that “<span class=""s2"">there are no advantages to be gained that would justify the bureaucratic nightmare of switching from one carbon tax to another slightly different one.”</span></p>
<p class=""p3"">But surely even the great minds of the Journal’s editorial board understand that Mr. Kenney would be laughed out of the room if he reneged on this promise just now. Even die-hard Alberta New Democrats would have chuckled.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Now consider <a href=""https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-we-are-voting-for-a-stronger-economy"">the collective wisdom of the members of the board on April 13</a>, mere hours before the provincial election that brought the UCP to power.</p>
<p class=""p3"">On the topic of the carbon tax, they argued that while it might have been a “gutsy” play by the NDP, it didn’t work. “Rachel Notley’s carrot approach on the pipeline file was a well-meaning endeavour but it failed to produce results. Now, it’s time to try the stick.”</p>

<p class=""p3"">“Now is the time Alberta, and by extension the rest of Canada, should be capitalizing on that resource to help bankroll a greener future,” they reasoned, rather illogically if one considers the carbon footprint of the oilsands, but whatever.</p>
<p class=""p3"">After heaping praise on Mr. Kenney, the Journal’s editorialists concluded: <i>“</i><span class=""s2""><i>On Tuesday, voters should choose the UCP.</i></span><span class=""s3""><i>”</i></span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Whether or not they were influenced by the efforts of the Journal’s editorialists, Alberta’s voters in their wisdom took their advice.</p>

<p class=""p3"">By May 18, critics of Postmedia were pointing out there is something remarkably wrong with the notion of a corporation with its hand out for a bailout from the federal government’s $600-million plan to put the legacy newspaper industry on life support to also be lobbying for a job in the ministry of propaganda of a political party opposed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and all his works.</p>
<p class=""p3"">By the May Long weekend, which immediately followed, the story had grown sturdy legs and was being reported in similar terms nationwide.</p>
<p class=""p3"">On May 23, Thursday, the National Observer – the independent online news site that does a better job of covering the Canadian fossil fuel industry than all of Postmedia put together – <a href=""https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/23/news/postmedia-hopes-it-can-thread-needle-between-kenney-and-trudeau"">reported that NDP Ethics Critic Charlie Angus had written Finance Minister Bill Morneau</a> to argue “Postmedia’s potential participation in the war room should disqualify it from government support, since it would make a mockery of independent journalism.”</p>
<p class=""p3"">On May 24, the Journal’s editorial appeared, apparently a lone, brave, independent voice calling on the UCP not to kill the carbon tax after all.</p>

Most of us have made that trip to the altar to tie the knot only to be sidetracked at the last minute by a tempting honeypot.

Postmedia has been lobbying Ottawa for quite some time now for some sort of newspaper subsidy. But then Jason Kenney’s war room tasty treat appeared out of the blue. So it’s only natural the media hound dogs would like to get their chops into as many yummy morsels as possible, preferably at the same time. It’s only human nature. Life’s a buffet table.

Well isn’t it interesting that the Journal chose just now to come out with that position on the carbon tax. Wasn’t this a big issue in Alberta politics and a key UCP policy since it was formed? Wasn’t the Federal commitment to put something in place, where provinces didn’t implement or renege on their own carbon taxes, fairly clear for a long time? Has the Journal editorial board been in a Rip Van Winkle sleep for the last year or two and they just woke up, or did Kenney cast some sort of spell on them that was somehow just broken?

I suspect the Journal and perhaps the Herald will make some effort to show some independence from the UCP for the next year or two, now that the election is safely over. Wasn’t it the same way things often operated under the PC’s? After the election, the main newspapers would sometimes savagely criticize the government for a few years, but grow more silent or supportive as the election approached and then often come out with an endorsement just when needed. Just like a dog that makes a great show of barking at innocent passer by’s during the day, but is oddly silent at night. I suppose the Journal is not quite a total lap dog perhaps, but not a great watch dog either.

I suspect they have also been stung by criticism of their coverage leading up to the election and now Kenney’s possible plan to reward them with cash to run the energy propaganda war room has further undermined their independence and credibility so now they have to make a show of independence .

Quebec will electrify transportation systems, buildings and businesses to drive massive cuts in fossil fuel use, Premier Legault told a meeting of his conservative and nationalist Coalition Avenir Québec party on Sunday.

It wouldn’t be a big surprise if Alberta’s new United Conservative Party leaders, who have just let it slip they think all this fuss about global climate change is the “flavour of the month,” react with irrational fury when the implications of this policy announcement begin to set in.

Perhaps they’ll sic the Alberta Government’s soon-to-be-formed Defamation Branch, or whatever the so-called “war room” turns out to be named for official purposes, on Mr. Legault and the CAQ.

That oughtta help! Because if there’s one thing concern about climate change sure as heck isn’t, it’s the flavour of the month. Flavour of the next century, more like.

It would not come as a surprise if the next Canadian jurisdiction to make an announcement similar to Mr. Legault’s turns out to be British Columbia, which like Quebec is rich in hydro resources.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (David J. Climenhaga).

B.C., of course, is already a target for the nascent “war room.” Maybe the war roomers can sue somebody over the Rockies and pretend B.C.’s high retail gas prices are the result of not having enough pipelines, instead of gouging by Alberta refiners as the numbers show they actually are.

For B.C. Premier John Horgan, such a promise would be a good way to overcome some of the anger among his own base at his NDP Government’s flip-flop on the Site C Dam on the Peace River after his party tenuously grasped power with the help of the B.C. Green Party in July 2017.

Meanwhile, Mr. Kenney’s flippant dismissal of global warming at a supposedly off-the-record meeting with the Globe and Mail’s editorial board in Toronto (never mind the flames licking the outskirts of High Level) is probably not the message the premier’s pals in Big Oil want him to be sending out right now.


B.C. Premier John Horgan (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Globe energy reporter Shawn McCarthy Tweeted Friday that Mr. Kenney told the board: “Investor concerns about climate risk are ‘flavor of the month’ and they should focus as much on labor rights, human rights and conventional enviro issues among OPEC dictatorships.”

Energy journalist Markham Hislop, who has already found himself on Mr. Kenney’s extensive Enemies List for saying stuff like this, argued that Mr. Kenney “seriously underestimates the degree to which the international oil companies and the Alberta oil sands producers have integrated carbon risk management into their corporate strategies.”

As for Mr. Kenney’s shot at oil dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hislop noted, “the ‘ethical oil’ argument should be seen for what it really is, a ham-fisted sleight of hand to deflect the focus from Alberta’s real environmental issues (for instance, 1.3 trillion litres of oil sands tailings sitting in 37 huge ponds and the inherently high carbon-intensity of oil sands bitumen).”

“Alberta can’t afford for a rookie premier to get it wrong on an issue that could significantly affect its biggest job creators from accessing the capital it so desperately needs,” Mr. Hislop concluded.

Well, OK. Maybe so. But if Mr. Kenney makes it a little harder for the big oil sands extraction companies to raise cash, it’s hard to feel all that much sympathy for them. After all, they did nothing to help Rachel Notley’s NDP government, despite it having already delivered the plan they say they wanted.

Regardless, Alberta’s NDP Government is history. But the premier of Quebec still has the opportunity to make history with his Québécois version of le nouvel accord vert, or whatever he decides to call his urban-electrification drive – not to mention to set an example for a worried world.

Interesting that the news that Kenney would be campaigning in Ontario during the federal election this fall came from the Premier’s office and has not had any corroboration from the CPC in Ottawa. They have tightly controlled budgets for elections and an announcement like this would mess those up. Who will pay for JK’s trips, if not the CPC?

167,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,B.C. Appeal Court’s Trans Mountain ruling may not be quite the slam-dunk Alberta thinks it is,2019-05-27 00:45:00,David Climenhaga,,"The unanimous ruling Friday by the British Columbia Court of Appeal that the B.C. Government does not have the constitutional authority to control what goes inside the federally regulated Trans Mountain Pipeline is being hailed as a great victory in Alberta.

Church bells didn’t actually ring on Friday, but the general tone of media coverage of the decision by five justices of the B.C. Court of Appeal was that it was “a great victory for Premier Jason Kenney” and a “humiliating court defeat” for B.C. Premier John Horgan.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Both of the passages in quotation marks were actually written in Postmedia’s Calgary Herald, which may be limbering up for the Toronto-based corporation’s hoped-for new role as part of Mr. Kenney’s partisan “war room” anti-environmentalism operation.

The first statement is obviously untrue, beyond the fact the ruling was the one longed for by Mr. Kenney and his new United Conservative Party Government. Mr. Kenney literally had nothing to do with it.

If any single politician deserves credit for the victory, it would probably be Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal government bought the pipeline when its private-sector owner was about to pull the plug on the expansion project, approved it once and will likely approve it again next month, and instructed a senior Justice Department counsel to make the arguments that ultimately prevailed before the court.

Don’t look for anyone in Alberta to admit this truth, though. The ironic ultimate result, one suspects, is that in the fall federal election campaign Mr. Trudeau will get all of the blame from outraged West Coast environmentalists and none of the credit from Alberta’s perpetually dissatisfied bitumen boosters.

As for the second statement, a better case can be made for that given the unanimity of the court’s decision, but it is unclear whether Mr. Horgan’s government ever expected to win this case, the outcome of which was confidently predicted by most legal scholars.


British Columbia Premier John Horgan (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

While Mr. Horgan and his Attorney General, David Eby, immediately signalled their intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada – to predictable howls of outrage from many of the usual suspects here in Alberta – there was a victory for B.C. in the ruling obscured by the prima facie defeat on Friday.

Remember, B.C. brought this forward as a reference case, to see if its argument for its right to regulate the contents of modes of transportation passing through the province’s territory would pass muster. So, by losing and being prepared to try again, it can be argued it wins politically by demonstrating its good intentions to the Green Party MLAs propping up its tenuous hold on the B.C. Legislature in Victoria, and to voters who might next time be tempted to go Green.

“You could almost feel sorry for the guy, if he hadn’t directly caused so much economic pain in Alberta,” complained a Herald columnist, apparently forgetting that Alberta’s pain was mainly caused by the Federal Court of Canada’s ruling on the slapdash way the project was originally approved.


British Columbia Attorney General David Eby (Photo: Wikimedia Commons).

Friday’s ruling also provides the B.C. NDP with a certain amount of political cover if it is still in power when the inevitable bitumen spill takes place in southern B.C.’s inland maritime waters.

More importantly, though, since it has now been clearly established that B.C. cannot control what goes through a federally regulated pipeline, a strong argument can be made that neither can Alberta.

Alert readers will recall the legislation, passed by Rachel Notley’s NDP Government and proclaimed into law by Mr. Kenney’s UCP, that was designed to cut off shipments of gasoline to British Columbia in the event its government and people won’t knuckle under to Alberta’s pipeline demands.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Surely what goes for the goose must go for the gander, all the more so if the B.C. appeals court’s ruling is confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. Such an outcome would slyly deprive Mr. Kenney’s government of this much-touted weapon in the event engaged coastal British Columbians find other ways to oppose or stall more pipelines running through their territory, either in the courts or in the political arena.

B.C.’s vow to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court is widely seen in Alberta as another outrage, merely an effort to stall the pipeline again. It’s just politics, pipeline supporters screech.

This is a bit rich coming from supporters of the UCP when Mr. Kenney is backing equally unpromising legal efforts by Conservative allies like Ontario’s Doug Ford and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe to stop the federal carbon tax.

These cases unquestionably are motivated strictly by politics, not by sound legal reasoning.

But there you go, as Mr. Kenney clearly understands, even if many of his supporters don’t, that’s what happens in a democracy with the rule of law. So don’t expect this story to end any time soon.

Large political headlines likely today

We can expect to learn today the political plans of former Liberal cabinet renegades Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, and the details of the Kenney Government’s tendentiously titled “Open for Business” Act, which will likely be aimed mainly at restricting the constitutionally protected collective bargaining rights of unionized workers and giving employers carte blanche to treat employees however they like","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

The ironic ultimate result, one suspects, is that in the fall federal election campaign Mr. Trudeau will get all of the blame from outraged West Coast environmentalists and none of the credit from Alberta’s perpetually dissatisfied bitumen boosters.</p>
<p class=""p4"">As for the second statement, a better case can be made for that given the unanimity of the court’s decision, but it is unclear whether Mr. Horgan’s government ever expected to win this case, the outcome of which was confidently predicted by most legal scholars.</p>

<p class=""p4"">While Mr. Horgan and his Attorney General, David Eby, immediately signalled their intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada – to predictable howls of outrage from many of the usual suspects here in Alberta – there was a victory for B.C. in the ruling obscured by the <i>prima facie</i> defeat on Friday.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Remember, B.C. brought this forward as a reference case, to see if its argument for its right to regulate the contents of modes of transportation passing through the province’s territory would pass muster. So, by losing and being prepared to try again, it can be argued it wins politically by demonstrating its good intentions to the Green Party MLAs propping up its tenuous hold on the B.C. Legislature in Victoria, and to voters who might next time be tempted to go Green.</p>
<p class=""p4"">“You could almost feel sorry for the guy, if he hadn’t directly caused so much economic pain in Alberta,” <a href=""https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-after-humiliating-court-defeat-b-c-premier-horgan-blusters-on"">complained a Herald columnist</a>, apparently forgetting that Alberta’s pain was mainly caused by the Federal Court of Canada’s ruling on the slapdash way the project was originally approved.</p>

<p class=""p4"">More importantly, though, since it has now been clearly established that B.C. cannot control what goes through a federally regulated pipeline, a strong argument can be made that <i>neither can Alberta</i>.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Alert readers will recall the legislation, passed by Rachel Notley’s NDP Government and proclaimed into law by Mr. Kenney’s UCP, that was designed to cut off shipments of gasoline to British Columbia in the event its government and people won’t knuckle under to Alberta’s pipeline demands.</p>

<p class=""p4"">Surely what goes for the goose must go for the gander, all the more so if the B.C. appeals court’s ruling is confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. Such an outcome would slyly deprive Mr. Kenney’s government of this much-touted weapon in the event engaged coastal British Columbians find other ways to oppose or stall more pipelines running through their territory, either in the courts or in the political arena.</p>
<p class=""p1"">B.C.’s vow to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court is widely seen in Alberta as another outrage, merely an effort to stall the pipeline again. It’s <i>just politics</i>, pipeline supporters screech.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is a bit rich coming from supporters of the UCP when Mr. Kenney is backing equally unpromising legal efforts by Conservative allies like Ontario’s Doug Ford and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe to stop the federal carbon tax.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These cases unquestionably are motivated strictly by politics, not by sound legal reasoning.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But there you go, as Mr. Kenney clearly understands, even if many of his supporters don’t, that’s what happens in a democracy with the rule of law. So don’t expect this story to end any time soon.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Large political headlines likely today</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">We can expect to learn today the political plans of former Liberal cabinet renegades Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, and the details of the Kenney Government’s tendentiously titled “Open for Business” Act, which will likely be aimed mainly at restricting the constitutionally protected collective bargaining rights of unionized workers and giving employers <i>carte blanche</i> to treat employees however they like.</p>

Since the TMX pipeline is owned by Canada, it seems unlikely that Kenney strutting about like a chook that’s just been fed can tell the owner what can be shipped through it when the chips are down. If Canadians collectively manage to put Scheer and the Cons in power this fall, the latter could wreck Confederation if they succumb to Mini-Emperor Jason and try to screw BC on gasoline shipments.

The Kinder Morgan web page used to show how they “batch” shipped various petrochemical products including gasoline through it. Right now, ripping off BC on gasoline pricing is flavor du jour, and who knows whether there’s collusion between the Alberta refiners and Cons on that. Whatever, it’s a damn unfriendly thing to do to your neighbour and a developing part of the original Notley hissy fit that Jason hasn’t changed. How to win friends and influence people.

If BC left Confederation, they could get product from the Northwest US without much trouble, and then tell Alberta to go fuddle-duddle itself on any petroleum shipments to the coast while advising Albertans to develop a liking for toasted triple decker dilbit sandwiches. Perhaps even Cons have the brainpower to work all this out in advance, though it might be a stretch to think so. They seem quite happy to piss off Quebec, which really isn’t too bothered what a load of wanna-be cowboys with a chip on their shoulders leaping up and down out west on the wrong side of history say.

The example of the UCP criticizing the BC for not accepting the recent court decision on pipelines, while it seems determined to ignore the recent Saskatchewan decision on carbon taxes is particularly poignant. It reeks of hypocrisy and this is exactly the sort of thing that turns off voters.

I think this helps explain why none of the three main parties are doing particularly well Federally now. The Federal Liberals who promised to do politics better seem to be mired in politics as usual, yet the NDP hasn’t benefited from their troubles, nor have the Federal Conservatives that much. The main beneficiary so far seems to be a newer party that has never held power – the Greens.

It might seem clever and be great fun for rabid partisans to criticize their opponents and to say they are terrible for doing the same things that when their own party does it, they are either silent or make excuses for. However, until one or more of the Federal parties figures out this does not go over so well with the voters, I suspect all three of them will continue struggle to gain more support.

I can’t wait to see the UCP’s “war room” hoisting a banner of the BC Court of Appeal’s opening words: 

“The protection of the environment is one of the driving challenges of our time. No part of the world is now untouched by the need for such protection; no government may ignore it; no industry may claim immunity from its constraints. This reference is not about whether the planned Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (“TMX”) should be regulated to minimize the risks it poses to the environment — that is a given. Rather, this reference asks which level or levels of government may do so under our constitution, specifically ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867”

The NDP immediately dubbed Bill 2 the Pick Your Pockets Bill, seeing as its provisions include a 13-per-cent pay cut to $13 an hour from $15 for students under 18 and a way for employers to force their employees to accept time off at straight time for overtime worked. The bill also makes it harder for working people to get holiday pay.


Labour Minister Jason Copping (Photo: Campaign material).

Actually, though, a better name for Bill 2 might be the Open for Fast Food Act.

After all, there wasn’t actually much meat in this unappetizing little burger, and most of the condiments appear to have been designed to please fast-food corporations.

The fast-food industry was so delighted it sent Vancouver-based Mark von Schellwitz, Restaurants Canada’s chief Western Canadian lobbyist, to chair the news conference put on by Mr. Kenney and Labour Minister Jason Copping in an Edmonton barroom. Richard Truscott of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, an organization that is also not exactly a friend of the workingman and woman, stood by beaming.


Restaurants Canada spokesperson Mark von Schellwitz (Photo: Twitter).

From the way the newser was organized, you almost would have thought Restaurants Canada was a branch of the Alberta Government and Mr. von Schellwitz a senior official. Then again, maybe that’s a pretty accurate description of the way things now work in our open-for-business UCP government.

Why pay for government lawyers when you can just get industry lobbyists to cook up legislation for you?

Hell, if that had been the case in 1944, when Restaurants Canada was known as the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, it wouldn’t have been necessary for the group to complain so vociferously about prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King letting the fight against Hitler and his Nazis cut into Canadian restaurant profits!

Well, that was then and this is now. Just the same, Restaurants Canada, one of a group of organizations with a history of advocating for anti-union laws, ran an energetic third-party campaign during the run-up to the April 16 election to help get the UCP elected.


CFIB’s Richard Truscott (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

So this may be what is known in politics as “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,” or, as Mr. Kenney put it yesterday, “promise made, promise kept.”

Predictably, there were a few mischievously anti-union timbits in Bill 2, though none of the really outrageous stuff observers had been braced for, like right-to-work rules designed to put unions out of business or restrictions on union activities other than narrowly defined labour relations work.

Don’t go to sleep, though. Hints were dropped yesterday in response to reporters’ questions that such changes might be included in another round of labour legislation in the fall.

Meantime, the bill restores the requirement for “democratic” certification votes in all union drives, no matter how many employees sign cards, and includes provisions for a mysterious government program to support unionized employees. Since unions already provide assistance for most things under the Labour Code, this presumably means members who aren’t happy with the representation they’re getting from unions will have a new government bureaucracy to help them.


William Lyon Mackenzie King (Photo: U.S. Farm Security Administration, Library of Congress).

Alberta unions should have no trouble dealing with either of these provisions. The first will make organizing a little harder when the employers bend the rules to bully their employees, as often happens, and the second may turn out to be an occasional nuisance.

Maybe the UCP can contract the work out to Restaurants Canada to avoid being accused of creating additional red tape!

Well, the Conservative attitude evident yesterday seemed to be no pain, no gain. Still, they were careful to ensure the pain is felt by students trying to get through their education and working people owed overtime pay, while the gain should go into the pockets of foreign corporate fast-food executives.

Pretty much standard operating procedure for Conservatives, in other words.


Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Kenney remarked during the news conference that the NDP government made “radical changes to Alberta labour law.” This is a bizarre claim when you consider the NDP only brought the province’s labour legislation mid-way up to standards that had had prevailed in other provinces for decades.

The premier also blew off concerns about the big pay cut for young workers by glibly reminding his audience that “thirteen bucks an hour is a heck of a lot more than zero bucks an hour, and that’s the option here.” This, of course, is untrue. But it is pretty much what you’d expect from a guy with a million-dollar pension who used to live in the basement of his mother’s old folks’ home.

Face it, Canadians don’t elect Conservative governments to be empathetic. They elect them to squeeze people they resent. In this regard, the UCP is performing to specifications.

The news conference also distracted nicely from the torrent of nasty stories about former UCP leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s “Kamikaze Campaign” that just won’t quit.

Yesterday’s installments revealed how the Office of the Election Commissioner has levied another $22,000 in fines against Mr. Callaway’s former campaign manager and chief finance officer, and how Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, who refuses to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the case, has now been interviewed by the RCMP about it.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to run as … independents

In the big national story of the day, former Liberal cabinet rebels Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott announced they will seek re-election this fall as Independent candidates.

No, they won’t be running for the Green Party, as had been widely rumoured, or even for the NDP, a possibility the Ottawa Press Gallery seems to have ruled out a few days ago.

This will give them an opportunity to take some votes from candidates in their ridings for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, the party from which they are estranged.

But actually hold onto their seats? Anything is possible, but it seems unlikely. Certainly campaign finance rules in Canada are tilted heavily against Independent candidates, which usually makes such efforts quixotic.

According to the reports they’ll be getting 13 bucks an hour for the first 28 hours and minimum wages after that. So expect a province filled with teens working a three day work week running around with a little pocket change buying slurpees with 18-24 years borrowing money from their younger siblings.

I await the Kenney government reducing AISH and other help for those who are disabled. I suspect they are next on the hit list.

I agree the organizing changes are largely a non-issue for Alberta unions. The minimum wage cut is the flip side of last week’s corporate tax cut. Reaganomics was described by John Kenneth Galbraith as the ideology that the rich will work harder if you offer them more and the poor will work harder if you offer them less. We now have a $13.00 minimum wage for the most vulnerable people in our economy. Welcome to the 1970s.

The CONs will go slowly when it comes to changes to its rural voters, but hard to imagine that all those communities that have already gone through the school and subsequent business closures, will not be hit with more costly “options” within the next several years – e.g., former NDPer Janice and her hospital closures throughout rural Saskatchewan. Kids who can be cowed into wage rollbacks, and those who work OT for only 2/3 of what they are entitled to in banked time, might even remember just who did these sorts of Medieval feudal policy changes (Might!).

The NDP interregnum in this province was a side-effect of the difficulties of reconciling the superstitious and the greedy, the eternal task of the Right. The other third of the people need to wrap their heads around the fact that the Keynesian welfare state of the post-war era was a temporary adaptation of the corporate elite, and thus the conditions that have prevailed since 1700 roll along merrily. Rule by elite financial speculators, minus the incentive to curry any favour with a consumer population whose labour is no longer required in the system. The sophistication of the bread and circuses machine is truly a marvel, and there is no reason to expect any trend other than an increase in the distraction and alienation of the population. Go Flames! And Tinder!

165,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Why wouldn’t Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer appoint an independent prosecutor in the Kamikaze Campaign case,2019-05-29 01:23:00,David Climenhaga,,"So riddle me this:
Why wouldn’t Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer appoint an independent Crown prosecutor to oversee the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into allegations of voting fraud in the 2017 United Conservative Party leadership race?

Especially now it’s been revealed by the CBC that Mr. Schweitzer, who himself was a candidate in that race, has been interviewed by the RCMP about what he knew of Jeff Callaway’s campaign?


Lord Chief Justice Gordon Hewart of the High Court of Justice (Photo: Public Domain).

After all, as Lord Chief Justice Gordon Hewart of the High Court of Justice in London famously observed in 1924, “Not only must Justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.”

As a lawyer, one would certainly hope Mr. Schweitzer is familiar with the principle enunciated by Justice Hewart in R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy.

Is the reason that Opposition Leader Rachel Notley, who as a New Democratic Party premier seeking a second term attacked the UCP for the sleaze associated with the leadership race that brought Jason Kenney to power, is asking for a special prosecutor?

The Kamikaze Campaign, as it has come to be known, was the effort by Mr. Callaway to knock off Mr. Kenney’s principal rival, former Wildrose leader Brian Jean, in a way that let Premier Kenney portray himself as the Gentleman Jason of Canadian politics.


Former UCP leadership candidate Jeff Callaway in his Wildrose Party days (Photo: Facebook).

If that’s why Mr. Schweitzer is resisting doing what’s obviously the only proper course available to him under the circumstances, given his own involvement in the campaign in which Mr. Callaway’s alleged “Kamikaze Mission” was conducted, that’s an understandable human emotion. Alas, it’s also a sound reason for ensuring that justice appears not to have been done.

Remember, Mr. Schweitzer himself complained that something was awry with the UCP’s voting procedures at the end of the campaign. The party ignored him then and he dropped the matter.

Moreover, he’s now the cabinet minister responsible for overseeing police investigations in the province, including those by the RCMP.

Or is the reason that the UCP won big and reckons it can bloody well do what it pleases as a result? Not a good reason either, it’s said here, and one that suggests serious ethical lapses in the ranks of the UCP may go beyond Mr. Callaway’s immediate circle.

Or is it just stubborn pride? A pious Christian like Mr. Kenney must be aware of King Solomon’s take on haughty spirits, which he supposedly advised goeth before a fall.

Well, it’ll be a while before the UCP has to worry about any falls. But every day Mr. Schweitzer delays appointing an independent prosecutor is a day he personally looks worse and the whole sordid affair – which has resulted in $71,000 in fines being levied by the Office of the Election Commissioner – smells worse.

As an aside, I’m sure the UCP would very much like to get rid of Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson, but that’s a matter for another blog post.

Not appointing a special prosecutor won’t stop the RCMP from investigating. It’s an independent federal force, after all. But the optics are terrible nevertheless. It’s hard to understand why this is happening when the best way out of this mess for everyone – including the UCP, presumably – would be to appoint a special prosecutor and let the case proceed independently from any suggestion of tampering.

As Justice Hewart continued: “Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of justice.” (Emphasis added, of course.)

“What’s so hard to understand about that?” Well it doesn’t square with the UCP mind, that’s what’s hard.

The grasping Emperor Jason Nero 1 couldn’t care less about propriety, and just as he easily thwarted the none-too-bright Jean, putting a restraining hand on his own Justice minister to not play fair is child’s play. He’s out for himself, and to hell with anyone else, so no encouragement of investigation of his nefariousness will be allowed. The renewed Alberta whining about the rest of Canada doing them in is part of the scheme — if the RCMP decide there’s a case, the bleating about the Feds and the way they treat the superhuman people of Alberta will only intensify. They can get the attack dog Rempel to shrilly condemn the rest of us in the Commons, because she’s Alberta first and somewhat paranoid, based on observations of her past pronouncements, which even got 22 Minutes coverage.

Alberta thinks it’s so special, the country has for over four decades endured Alberta complaining nobody listens to it when their blinkered view should be welcomed as deep and thoughtful countrywide policy. Why should we give them pride of place in this country? The easy arithmetic of figuring out why 11% of our populace, mired in pre-environmental crisis thinking of rampant resource extraction, and voting to be ruled by someone about as bright socially at his core as the hoity toits of Alabama, is not enough to tell the rest of us what to do, apparently constantly escapes small provincial minds. It’s preposterous to all of us but Alberta.

That is all.

Given the UPC’s limited understanding of the concept of independent oversight, I can’t see the point. The UPC leadership campaign was ‘independently’ audited by Dorward & Company, the company formed by the UPC candidate for Edmonton Gold Bar, David Dorward.

As you say DC, why wouldn’t they appoint an independent prosecutor? It’s worth remembering that in 2006 then PC Justice Minister Ron Stevens appointed an independent prosecutor (the late Alex Pringle) to look into allegations that a key document had been altered by the government and presented to a freedom of information inquiry affecting the Edmonton Journal and government flight logs. In the end, no one was prosecuted. That case was documented by Charles Rusnell, then of the Journal.

Maybe. Alberta has a history. The bureaucrats know if they step out of line they will be fired or given the option of moving to some TB infested reserve. The Crown Prosecutors want to be appointed as Judges and are not stupid enough to step on delicate political toes (see above). Lawyers understand they will be relegated to doing wills and divorces if they step on said toes. The Judges know that the UCP will simply pass a new law nullifying any judicial decision they don’t like. And of course even the UCP are not dumb enough to appoint an impartial prosecutor, especially if a compliant Con from another province cannot be found. Welcome to Louisiana on the way down.

Why would the UCP not appoint a special prosecutor? I think its because someone has something to serious hide and they feel what might be uncovered could be more damaging than the perception they are not being fully transparent here. There is obviously a temptation for the UCP to try control things, whether they go so far to obstruct or not, and the risk is they do lose a bit of control by appointing a special prosecutor. However, I would argue with the RCMP already involved they have lost control of this issue to a large degree, whether they realize it or not.

It was easy for a while for the UCP to dismiss the NDP’s concerns during the election as political, but now that the election is over and there will not another one for several years, that argument is not very strong. Also the fact that this issue does not seem to be going away after the election either, with a drip, drip, drip of more fines and violations being announced since then by Elections Alberta and the RCMP meeting with more people since then, including the Justice Minister now.

The Justice Minister has put himself in a somewhat uncomfortable position by not removing himself totally from this investigation, even more so now that the RCMP are talking to him. Also, how does he reconcile his original statements about concerns with the leadership voting process, with the current UCP position that basically it was all fine? I would love to hear him explain that to the public, as he would have had to try explain that to the RCMP. I have a feeling Mr. Schweitzer’s political career could be one of the casualties of this scandal. He may not have been involved as a perpetrator, but he sure seems to be trying to bury it and hope it will go away. I don’t think it will.

164,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Is Alberta’s ‘Yes to TMX’ campaign a sly tax-funded attack on the Trudeau Liberals,2019-05-30 02:00:00,David Climenhaga,,"Things are certainly different on the pipeline front now that Jason Kenney and his United Conservative Party are in power in Alberta!

Yesterday, the airwaves were full of reports Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage had announced an advertising campaign urging Parliamentarians to say “Yes to TMX.” (We’ll get back to the messaging in a moment.)


Ms. Savage at the UCP’s recent Throne Speech in Edmonton (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The Kenney government is prepared to spend $1.6 million on this campaign in Ottawa alone, media breathlessly reported. More would be spent elsewhere in the country, although the UCP’s not ready to say how much.

Ms. Savage, a former oil industry executive, told a roadside news conference with Parliament Hill for a backdrop that, “We need to approve the pipeline without hesitation. … Our campaign will reinforce this message across the country. It’s time for a firm decision on Trans Mountain Pipeline. It’s time for a ‘yes.’”

Ms. Savage was standing in front of a cube van which, as the CBC put it in its report, was “emblazoned with messages promoting the pipeline.”

The campaign has a website, YesToTMX.ca, for those who want more emails.

Compare this to 2018 when the NDP was in power …

Oh! Wait! In 2018, the NDP was doing exactly the same thing! Who knew?


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The NDP was spending about half a million dollars a week placing full-page print and online advertisements in newspapers across the country. In addition, it was buying outdoor advertising in Ottawa, radio ads, doing national polling and running its online “Keep Canada Working” campaign.

The messaging was basically the same: The NDP campaign claimed Canada was losing $40 million a day because of the lower price fetched by Alberta crude in the U.S. and that a pipeline to the West Coast would fix that. (Both statements are controversial and disputed by many experts.) “In the 30 seconds it takes to listen to this ad, Canada will lose $15,000,” alleged one clip.

This NDP ad campaign is credited with turning Canadian public opinion around on the merits of completing the Trans Mountain Pipeline, now owned by Ottawa

The NDP’s version also emphasized the safety of pipelines compared to other methods of transporting crude. And it had a nice website, too, KeepCanadaWorking.ca.

If you click on KeepCanadaWorking.ca today, you’ll go straight to YesToTMX.ca, so you can’t compare and contrast very easily. The new UCP website slips in Mr. Kenney’s oft-repeated sotto voce threat that not letting Alberta have its way will put national unity at risk. The UCP campaign also repeats the claim not having a pipeline costs Canada money every day.

But there is another difference that should be more evident.


Part of the NDP’s ad campaign saying pretty much the same thing in Ottawa last fall (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The NDP campaign was designed to do what it purported to do, sell Canadians on the need to get to work on the Trans Mountain Expansion Project as quickly as possible. You could argue the merits of that case, but that’s all it was.

The UCP campaign, in a shade of bright Tory blue reminiscent of the Harper Government’s branding, is promoting more than a pipeline. It has a subtext – or maybe it’s a supertext, since it seems to get more prominence on the mobile advertising in the nation’s capitol than what is supposedly the main message.

Media images of Ms. Savage’s news conference show the smaller panel on the back of the truck, in French and English, saying “Yes to TMX pipeline June 18.” But outside Alberta and circles obsessed with the debate, who even knows what TMX means, in French or English?

The main message, on the truck’s side panel, reads: “Ottawa, we have a problem.”

There’s some palaver about the TMX and June 18 below that, but it’s not what viewers of the ads will see when they whiz past the sign, or it whizzes past them.

Is this a plea to say yes to the TMX, or a sly effort paid for by Alberta taxpayers to attack the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau? Is it designed to boost the fortunes of the blue team, led by the Andrew Scheer, the guy who’s been described as Stephen Harper with a nicer smile?

Will the campaign continue after June 18, and if it does, will the pro-Tory messaging get less subtle after that, regardless of the federal government’s decision?

So what’s this really about? According to Ms. Savage, “if there is any delay, we could lose an entire construction season and that’s going to have an unbelievable detrimental impact to Alberta.”

That’s a debatable proposition on both counts, of course, but it’s fair to say Mr. Trudeau has a serious political consideration to make when pondering his cabinet’s June decision. After all, he’s not going to gain any votes by doing what Alberta wants, and he may just lose a few by appearing to knuckle under to Mr. Kenney’s demands.

On the other hand, his government bought the broken pipeline, so he now may feel he must abide by the political version of the fictitious Pottery Barn Rule.

As we learned from Ontario Conservative Premier Doug Ford’s recent childish gas-pump sticker stunt, there are no restrictions on provincial campaign activities during national campaigns.

With Mr. Ford’s bromantic partner in Alberta now appearing to cook up more sophisticated ways to use tax money to support the federal Conservatives, Ottawa may need to close that dangerous loophole","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p3"">The main message, on the truck’s side panel, reads: <i>“Ottawa, we have a problem.”</i></p>
<p class=""p3"">There’s some palaver about the TMX and June 18 below that, but it’s not what viewers of the ads will see when they whiz past the sign, or it whizzes past them.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Is this a plea to say yes to the TMX, or a sly effort paid for by Alberta taxpayers to attack the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau? Is it designed to boost the fortunes of the blue team, led by the Andrew Scheer, the guy who’s been described as Stephen Harper with a nicer smile?</p>
<p class=""p3"">Will the campaign continue after June 18, and if it does, will the pro-Tory messaging get less subtle after that, regardless of the federal government’s decision?</p>
<p class=""p3"">So what’s this really about? According to Ms. Savage, “if there is any delay, we could lose an entire construction season and that’s going to have an unbelievable detrimental impact to Alberta.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">That’s a debatable proposition on both counts, of course, but it’s fair to say Mr. Trudeau has a serious political consideration to make when pondering his cabinet’s June decision. After all, he’s not going to gain any votes by doing what Alberta wants, and he may just lose a few by appearing to knuckle under to Mr. Kenney’s demands.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the other hand, his government bought the broken pipeline, so he now may feel he must abide by the political version of the fictitious Pottery Barn Rule.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As we learned from Ontario Conservative Premier Doug Ford’s recent childish gas-pump sticker stunt, <a href=""https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/provinces-messages-exempt-from-federal-campaign-restrictions-chief-electoral-officer-1.4404061"">there are no restrictions on provincial campaign activities during national campaigns</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With Mr. Ford’s bromantic partner in Alberta now appearing to cook up more sophisticated ways to use tax money to support the federal Conservatives, Ottawa may need to close that dangerous loophole.</p>

Maybe I’m missing something here, but Mr. Trudeau has already said yes to TMX a number of times. It is the BC government and some courts, which neither Mr. Trudeau or Mr. Kenney can control, who have at times said no.

As usual Mr. Kenney is clever in his choice of words and slogans, but not quite accurate. A more accurate slogan would be “Oh god, please say yes again”. It is not so much an attack on Trudeau, but a plea with a hint of fear and desperation behind it. Of course Kenney often picks his battles so he can win either way. If Trudeau does say yes again, Kenney will claim all the credit and tell Albertans his ad campaign worked, although in reality the previous Alberta government laid most of the ground work and did a lot more work on this than him. If Trudeau does not say yes, Kenney will probably zip off on an anger trip across Ontario where he will connect with more Federal Conservative supporters than Scheer ever will meet so coincidentally or not his aspirations for higher office will be funded by Alberta taxpayers.

Kenney and Ford have something Scheer does not right now – access to a lot more government funds to get their message across. As someone who remembers all those seemingly endless ads for Canada’s economic action plan by the previous Harper Conservative government, I have observed Conservatives are not shy when it comes to government spending to get their message across. They seem to spend more Liberally on this than, well Liberals. However I am not sure how helpful it will be, in the end it didn’t help Harper win.

I think voters may be even more annoyed if the spending is to attack another level of government. Ford’s popularity seems to be falling even faster than Trudeau’s now. Mr. Kenney should be careful with his ad campaigns, unless he wants to suffer the same fate as Ford or Harper.

First, the existing TMX is fully booked up and will remain fully booked up. The new TMX has no bearing on the owners of the existing TMX.
It was a complete bonehead decision for the feds to buy the TMX but it pays for itself. The construction of the new pipeline is a whole new and different set of decisions.

Secondly and mainly, why wouldn’t the Kenney mob spin the pipeline debate in their political favour? There is not, and never was under the Notley banner, any truth to the blatherings and protestations that form the basis of this argument.
If people are blind and foolish enough to buy one brand of snake-oil, why not the other?

This obsession from the NDP and UCP to try to revitalize the dying oil industry is quite exhausting to listen to. The incessant complaining that Ottawa doesn’t care even though they bought this stupid pipeline is also very hard to deal with. The news that the UCP had to cancel their announcement of killing the carbon tax because of the smoke that has the air does make me smile. This can’t be created by even the best writers in the world.

What amazes me is this belief that if we implement a carbon tax, all drive electric cars and quit increasing oil production that we will no longer have forest fires or floods. Alberta implemented a carbon tax on large emitters in 2007, B.C. implemented their carbon tax in 2008 and yet unfortunately we still have forest fires and periodic floods. A quick look at Wikipedia shows how insignificant we really are, this quote refers just to China. “Based on analysis of satellite photos in 2018, environmental NGO Global Energy Monitor claims that 259 GW on new coal capacity in under construction including plants that central authorities had cancelled, postponed or slowed.” To put this in perspective, the sum total of Alberta’s coal generation capacity is 5.723 GW or just over 2% of what China has under construction, also remember China already had 960 GW of electricity being generated by coal in 2016. So when the new builds are completed they will have over 1200 GW coming from coal. Now I certainly believe in using our resources efficiently and striving for a healthy environment but promoting that if we don’t make drastic changes the world will become uninhabitable by 2030 is fear mongering and irresponsible. If people like Justin Trudeau truly believed this wouldn’t he change his jet setting lifestyle? Enjoy your day.

162,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Methinks the MP doth protest too much! Michael Cooper came to that Justice Committee meeting loaded for bear,2019-06-03 05:00:00,David Climenhaga,,"Now that St. Albert-Edmonton MP Michael Cooper has been given a gentle tap on the wrist by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer for his offensive performance at the House of Commons Justice Committee Thursday, we can be confident Conservatives will try to make the whole thing disappear as quickly as possible.

Why not? As the Opposition leader himself stated via Twitter, apparently the main conduit for all important public business nowadays: “Mr. Cooper has apologized. I accept his apology and I consider the matter closed.” (Emphasis added.)


Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Flickr/Andrew Scheer).

Indeed, it’s quite convenient for Mr. Scheer, who not so long ago was in hot water for addressing a “Yellow Vest” rally the same day as alt-right social media exile Faith Goldy, to be made to appear a virtual moderate by comparison to the actions of an indiscreet young member of his caucus!

Nothing to see here, folks. Move along, please.

For punishment, if such it can be called, Mr. Cooper will no longer be allowed to represent the Conservative Party of Canada on the Justice Committee, of which he was vice-chair. He will continue, though, as the party’s deputy justice critic, and therefore by definition an up-and-comer in Conservative ranks.


Mr. Cooper on the campaign trail in 2015 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Cooper presumably earned this soft treatment in part by issuing an apology of his own, also via social media: “Earlier this week at the Justice committee, I interpreted comments by witness Faisal Khan Suri as linking mainstream conservatism with violent extremism,” he wrote in a Facebook post that is already rapidly moving down the feed and out of sight. “In response, I quoted the words of a white supremacist anti-Muslim mass murderer in an ill-advised attempt to demonstrate that such acts are not linked to conservatism.”

“I absolutely should have not quoted these words nor named the perpetrator,” he said. “This was a mistake. I apologize to Mr. Suri and to all Canadians. …”

Now, Mr. Cooper has his defenders, quite a few of whom apparently think amplifying the manifesto of a terrorist murderer is an entirely appropriate thing to do. But most commentators grasped immediately that to describe this as “ill advised” was a considerable understatement.


St. Albert NDP MLA Marie Renaud (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Even in his apology, though, Mr. Cooper clung to the idea his action was appropriate. Remember, he said, he only meant to demonstrate “that such acts are not linked to conservatism.”

Mr. Suri was describing to the Justice Committee the Internet browsing habits of Alexandre Bissonnette, the Canadian anti-Muslim terrorist now serving a life sentence for murder, when the president of the Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council spoke the words that prompted Mr. Cooper’s offensive lecture.

“The evidence from Bissonette’s computer showed he repeatedly sought content about anti-immigrant, alt-right and conservative commentators, mass murderers, U.S. President Donald Trump, and about Muslims, immigrants living in Quebec,” Mr. Suri told the committee.

Nothing in this statement is factually untrue or misleading. None of it draws listeners to the conclusion Mr. Cooper said it did – that therefore all conservative commentators or so-called mainstream conservatives advocate extremism.

In fact, as virtually everyone understands, far too many “mainstream conservatives” do advocate things that can be fairly described as hate or extremism – either that, or mainstream conservatism is increasingly dominated by extremists. Mr. Scheer himself has been known to emit a dog whistle or two, as he did on Feb. 25 just by showing up with Ms. Goldy at the Yellow Vest rally on Parliament Hill.

Meanwhile, however, a lot of Canadians are still asking themselves, “What got into Mr. Cooper?”

This may be the wrong question.

Mr. Cooper is my MP. To meet him is to know he is a highly intelligent person – although that doesn’t make him smart, necessarily, in the colloquial meaning of that word.

His extreme social conservatives views, such as his strong opposition to women’s reproductive rights (even when those opinions can be hard to find), appear to be quite sincere.

Trained as a lawyer, he calculates his moves carefully, for maximum advantage. He may only be 35, but he has been a Conservative activist since he was 14. He was once the youngest member of the Canadian Alliance’s powerful National Council.

And he came to the committee loaded for bear.

That is, he’d obviously decided in advance that somebody – perhaps Mr. Suri – might connect the obvious dots between extremism and modern Canadian mainstream conservative movement and he was prepared to respond by making a scene.

We know this because he came equipped with quotable excerpts from the Christchurch mosque attacker’s manifesto – a move he must have known would be controversial and which can’t have been that easy because of the efforts of the New Zealand Government to suppress its distribution, with half-hearted assistance from social media corporations.

Challenging someone in heat about a statement one thing. Turning up all primed and ready with a terrorist manifesto in hand to prove a point you want to make before a word has been spoken by a witness is beyond the pale.

As for Andrew Scheer’s pledge two days earlier that there’s no place for extremists in the Conservative Party, the way the Conservative leader dealt with Mr. Cooper is a pretty strong indicator of what this really means. Most of us can connect these dots, as well.

Mr. Cooper won easily in St. Albert-Edmonton in 2015. In defence of the riding’s voters, most of them didn’t really know much about him other than the usual campaign folderol.

Meanwhile, on April 16, the provincial riding that occupies much of the same territory saw the re-election of a popular NDP MLA, Marie Renaud.

Mr. Cooper’s views do not reflect those of most St. Albertans, Ms. Renaud said on Facebook Friday. “Mr. Cooper’s remarks rejecting the links between white supremacy, racism, nationalist terrorism, and far right fake news sites such as Rebel Media are disturbing.”

So, perhaps a few more people will be paying attention to Mr. Cooper’s views and qualifications for the job when he runs for re-election this fall than did in 2015. Still, it will be extremely hard for any non-conservative candidate to win anywhere in Alberta in 2019, no matter how appalling their behaviour.

So my guess is St. Albert is going to continue to be embarrassed by Michael Cooper. Pity.

The reason violent, neo-fascists, racist extremism and mainline conservatism have been linked is that advocates, admirers and sympathizers of violent, neo-fascists, racist extremists have been made, either through word, deed, or “nudge, nudge, wink, wink”, to feel welcome in the ranks of mainline conservative parties. Violent, neo-Marxist and left-anarchist extremists, OTOH, have not been similarly made to feel welcome in the Liberal, New Democratic or Green parties, and so we hear virtually nothing from that extreme of the political spectrum. Of course, they’re out there, but I would venture to assert that none of the recent violent attacks in the headlines were inspired by that kind of opinion.

“Mr. Cooper won easily in St. Albert-Edmonton in 2015. In defence of the riding’s voters, most of them didn’t really know much about him other than the usual campaign folderol.”

I’m a voter in the possibly forgotten Edmonton portion of his riding. I knew about him at the last election, I think because of something you wrote on your blog concerning his social conservative views during Cooper’s nomination process. I didn’t vote for him them, and won’t vote for him this fall. I’ve adopted the position that life is far too short to vote for social conservatives.

Unfortunately, we are at the point where you can run a cantaloupe melon under the federal conservative banner and it will win anywhere in Alberta this fall except for Edmonton Strathcona and perhaps a few other central urban ridings. It’s a disappointing state of affairs. The conservatives take Alberta’s voters for granted, other federal parties view us as a lost cause, and someone whom I hope does not share the values of a majority of the riding’s voters on social issues ends up representing us in Ottawa.

Cooper may be intelligent, but he is about as bright as TV’s Sheldon Cooper. A stiff ostrich-necked socially backward lecturing twit – the ideal Conservative, he completely believes in himself and the rubbish he spews. Rigid-minded Cons seem to sprout fully-formed out of thin air in Alberta, but this one only appeared as a full-blown nitwit with regressive views at the advanced age of 14, you say. Must have been charming around the home and at school. His tone on TV was about all I could take without getting angry at his smug haughtiness and racism.

If anyone disagrees with them, the standard Con response is to say that such folk are socialist/leftists, are highly argumentative and incoherent, and won’t engage in civil discussion. Right out of Playbook 101 of the Conservative mindset. Disagreement with nitwiticism means you’re argumentative and uncivil? Of course! That’s because Cons are always correct in their twisted illogical minds, not subject to doubt or to ever acknowledge other viewpoints as valid, so mere disagreement with them means you’re uncivil. Deep brainpower at work. Then they sit down in self-realized triumph and figure they’ve won an intellectual battle while looking smug. It would be comedy hour if it weren’t so serious.

Another trope is to proclaim that anyone to the left of them is socialist, and invoke the spectre of Commie hordes and “immigrants” over-running the land and carrying off the daughters of decent citizens, and we all know commies and socialists are godless authoritarian technocrats who want to order people around, don’t we? Yes, indeed, social democracy is evil, dontcha know.

In fact, of course, it’s the Cons who want to order everyone around and place people in slots of social hierarchy where they can be picked off individually as unreliable, if they even squawk a little bit at crap treatment, for the benefit of the corporate order who want more labour for less reward. Anyone who starts a business to use plebs at minimum unliveable wage is a Con hero, even a greasy spoon or Timmies’ owner. Hence anti-unionism remains at the forefront of the narrow Con mind — can’t let those peple share thoughts and organize against employers for decent wages, now can we? Upsets the pecking order. Turn any Con critical comment about social democracy, er sorry “socialism”, on its head, and you will find their real feelings about the sheeple who are only useful for getting them into power, after which exploitation is on the cards, no complaints allowed. Legions of Federal government scientists found that out the hard way under harper, where “handlers” even accompanied scientists to international conferences to make sure they toed his dictatorial Con line of retrograde BS. Why, he even became a nuclear expert on the Chalk River matter – thank you, Stevie, from the bottom of my scientifically-trained heart. Beware Con pols who proclaim their opponents want to control citizens – because that’s exactly what they want to do themselves — harper showed that in spades.

Michael Cooper is an xenophobic misogynist Con. That’s a statement. And not worth an argument.

Scheer doesn’t seem to know which way is up, so covers all the bases just in case. Love me please, he pleads. I wanna be your leader. Good god. It’ll be harper time again. Meanwhile Sub-Pope Jason 1, another social regressive who at heart thinks he can order women about and control their bodies for the Lord, manages to dig up female supporters with brains of petrified lard who for unknown reasons, except possibly religion, apparently agree to subordinate their free will, while rubbing his hands with glee at Scheer’s incompetence. Jay’s smarmy ways look hot to convince your average apolitical Canuck that he might eventually be PM after Scheer shows he’s amateur hour personified. Only thing is, Thug Ford is kind of screwing up the Con message in Ontario, which may finally impinge on brains there except for the slavering attack dogs who think he’s the bee’s knees and wouldn’t know a legal from an illegal immigrant if you gave them a squad of PhD sociologists to assist them. So to be on the “safe” side they hate all of them; it’s easier that way for people of limited intellectual capacity and education.

The trouble is, the alternative to the Cons is the shape-shifting Trudeau, bringer of promises and deliverer of none, and friend of unethical billionaires who need a bit of special treatment and excuses now and then because they’re so special and pay scarcely no taxes to support the common-weal, yet somehow sometimes provide jobs which strikes Justin bodily to the very core of his conscious soul. Jobs trump ethics, oh yeah. At heart he’s conservative, and along with Wilson-Raybould brought in the attack on charter rights last fall in a new law, where any dope of a cop can stop any driver for no reason whatsoever and administer a sobriety/drug test of questionable efficacy. That’s your Liberal malleable brain power at work for you. Genteel removal of your rights.

All this general furore is happening before any consideration of climate change effects that now bring each year more bad floods in the east and ever-worsening wildfires from the West to Northern Ontario, which crisis no mainstream pol wants to tackle except the Greens. So your grandkids are in deep do-do, folks. Dig an extra barrel of tarsands for god and hope it all goes away seems to be the average citizen’s response. The latest NDP environment plan is sickeningly plagiaristic and paper thin in detail, and probably dreamed up of an evening over a couple of beer. The party is useless under Singh.

The country is screwed.

Mr. Scheer’s mild chastising of Mr. Cooper is not going to help the situation for the Conservatives, indeed it probably hurts it. There is already a sense that the Conservatives are soft on anti Muslim right wing extremists, Mr. Cooper’s comments and Mr. Scheer’s response reinforces that.

We must remember two things about Mr. Scheer in order to understand why he would behave in such a politically unhelpful way. First, Mr. Scheer won the leadership because he was to the Conservatives the most innocuous candidate. He was socially conservative enough to appeal to enough social conservatives and fiscally conservative enough to appeal to some Conservatives who might have liked Bernier, but worried about him being a bit of a loose canon and too controversial. While recent good poll numbers are helpful, his hold on the party is still rather tenuous. so his ability to actually seriously discipline anyone is therefore probably rather limited. Second, there is the Bernier problem, which while it has receded somewhat still exists. Mr. Bernier seems to be going after the anti immigrant, anti refugee vote. These are people who probably voted Conservative in the past and in a close race, Mr. Scheer probably can’t afford to lose them, although I am sure he realizes there is a danger in pandering to them too much.

So of course the type of solution to his quandary, is a solution that will probably satisfy few or no one. Mr. Cooper will get off with a slap on the wrist. I have a feeling that the political career of Mr. Cooper. despite being him being a bit of an embarrassment to his party at an inopportune time, will probably outlast that of Mr. Scheer’s. Perhaps Mr. Cooper will learn from this, or perhaps not, but whether Mr. Scheer does or not, I doubt Mr. Scheer will develop any more back bone any time soon.

Canadians need to remember, though, that the landings on June 6, 1944, by 156,000 Canadian, British, American and other Allied soldiers along the beaches of Normandy were the hammer that battered Germany.


Reginald H. Roy, author of 1944: The Canadians in Normandy (Photo: University of Victoria).

The anvil, the first front in the war against Hitler, was in the East, and it was against Russia that Adolf Hitler’s armies were eventually crushed in the vise created by the D-Day landings.

It must have been about 40 years ago when my military history professor – soldier, scholar and author of 1944: The Canadians in Normandy, Reginald H. Roy – reminded my classmates and me that if it hadn’t been for the anvil of the Red Army in the East, the hammer of D-Day in the West would have amounted to much less.

“We’d still be in Normandy,” was the way Professor Roy put it, and he didn’t mean as tourists like the political supernumeraries from Canada that show up now and then on a French beach on June 6.

Indeed, the chances are good that without six million soldiers of the Red Army pressing Hitler’s Eastern flank in 1944, we would not be in France at all, but for the dead and a few diplomats. About 80 per cent of the German Army’s casualties were inflicted by the Red Army, which after June 1944 cleared the Wehrmacht from Eastern Europe, wiped out an entire German Army Group and opened the road to Berlin.

Five years ago, Stephen Harper petulantly conceded that Russian President Vladimir Putin should be allowed to visit Normandy for the 70th anniversary ceremonies.

A Postmedia writer at the time wrote that “only one Soviet soldier is known to have been buried in a war grave on the Western Front.”

Fine, just don’t forget that there are something like 11 million of the poor bastards buried on the Eastern Front to make up for that.

Without them we’d likely all have had to learn German as our second language in school, regardless of whether it turned out we answered to Washington or Berlin.

You’d think from the re-heated Cold War rhetoric we heard from Mr. Harper’s Conservative government and still sometimes hear from Justin Trudeau’s Liberal one, that we’d been fighting Russia, not Germany, in 1944.

Francois Hollande, the president of France in 2014, hit the right note when he gracefully told French TV: “We may have differences with Vladimir Putin but I have not forgotten and will never forget that the Russian people gave millions of lives. I told Vladimir Putin that as the representative of the Russian people, he is welcome to the ceremonies.”

Mr. Trudeau struck a better tone this year in France. “Only those who threw themselves against the walls of the fortress of Europe in Normandy know the full extent of what unfolded here 75 years ago. But it is the responsibility of all Canadians to ensure that their story, and their sacrifice, will never be forgotten.”

My father was in the war. As a Christian, he didn’t like it, always rationalized it as “we had to go to stop Hitler,” and no matter how much anyone might agree, I always felt he really meant: we had to commit the sin of killing to stop an even bigger sinner. Otherwise he didn’t say much about it—not like plenty of other vets I’ve hoisted a few with who, for whatever reason, liked to brag about their exploits, how many “Huns” they killed, and how they did it. I think his first low-level flight over Berlin, this time bringing humanitarian aid at the end of the War, really affected him: indescribable destruction—and the human suffering that must have gone on. They were the enemy, but I don’t think he ever forgave himself. He was in the airforce.

One thing he did say, not infrequently, was that “we never would have won without the Russians,” as he always called the Soviet Union. After all, it was Imperial Russia when he was a small boy, and old school books probably hadn’t been updated out in the Ontario sticks—at least not a quickly as the Soviets did theirs after their Revolution (in 1917, 99% of Russians were illiterate; within ten years, 99% were literate; the central government seized what school books there could have been in such an illiterate country, and reissued properly censored ones, eliminating fully half the lexicon of a once great language —“bourgeois” words out— and almost a quarter of the alphabet; school books were completely renewed every five years).

It’s true: most of us have only heard the Western Front version of the War, D-Day naturally being centre stage. The narrative we made of the East was biased by different streams of animosity toward the Soviet Union. First was the foreshadowing of Dostoyevsky’s novels describing the inhuman treatment of serfs in Tsarist Russia; probably next is the little-known “intervention” by Western Allies in 1918-20 when Canada joined with the USA and Britain, and a number of European and Asian nations (yes, Japanese regulars fought in Siberia) to invade Russia from East and North whilst it convulsed in civil war. The Reds won and the losers (us) preferred not to mention it, ever again—perhaps with a touch of irony, this harrowing struggle—a completely undeclared war— didn’t make it into school books about the Great War (WW I). But I’m sure Soviet schoolboys knew about it.

Next came the Soviet-style Holocaust, the Holodomor or mass starvation of millions of kulaks who refused to cooperate with farm collectivization during the 30s in Ukraine; Stalin’s murderous reputation was fully developed by the time WW II came along.

In retrospect, there’s an aspect of the Cold War “red scare” that Western schoolboys might have found disturbing—had they been given the opportunity to read about it: the Soviets, spurred by Stalin’s deep paranoia and, naturally, the Nazi’s attack actually achieved the most rapid economic and industrial development of all time. That little factoid certainly didn’t jibe with anti-communism propaganda. But of course things like the “Intervention” and Soviet-style, crash-industrialization, like a lot of stuff, didn’t make it into our school books in the West.

I was lucky enough to study Russian language (which I love) so’s to read the classics in original tongue (I’ve since lost this ability through non-use—I could probably get it back: Russian is easy, the Soviets made it so there are no exceptions to grammatical rules). I’m also fascinated by the equivalent “pioneering” between Canada and Russia: how many here know that Russians had their own “cowboys (Cossacks) and Indians (the native peoples of Sibir)?” As fascinating is Russia’s problems with northern development—many similarities with Canada’s. Russia, I’ve bothered to learn, is a great nation with a history that was as important for Europe as it was for them, the Christian bulwark against Asiatic Hordes, and of course its importance in WW II which, like my Dad always said, was critical to our eventual victory.

But ignorance in the West seems mostly to be in not really getting how devastating the War was for ordinary Russians and other nations of the Soviet Union. It was almost incredible.

Russia will always be influential on the world scene. It is a great nation which has experienced tragedies we in the West barely recognize, let alone empathize with. Russians even survived the collapse of communism and partition of their territory—and, most of all, the attempted neoliberal invasion from the West which chucked ethics in favour of greedy chest-thumping, the “end of history” and all (we’re only now experiencing the end-stages of neoliberal globalization—history didn’t really end). We’ll do well to remember what Russians have been through and how they look at us.

I’m lucky: my Dad always told me: without Russia, we would have never won the War and beaten one of the greatest sinners in modern history. I’ve always known this since I was a boy. Forget, for a moment, that Stalin was as guilty as Hitler in human terms, and think about the ordinary Soviet citizen, workers and soldiers to whom we owe so much.

Everybody should know this, especially on D-Day celebrations. You are absolutely right, DJC.

The “hammer and anvil” metaphor doesn’t seem particular suited to the real scenario in which the Red Army actively tore apart the German armed forces from the first day of Barbarossa. The Soviets lost almost 200 000 men killed at the First Battle of Smolensk, a fight that seems to have so badly damaged the Germans that they ended up stuck outside Moscow in December of ’41 when yet another massive clash ensued in which both sides suffered a million or so casualties in a month. This is long before Stalingrad, Kursk and the annhillation of Army Group Centre during Operation Bagration. In general, people’s perception of the war’s causes, it’s course, and outcomes are entirely fictious, the product of propagandists. Poland, the jumping off point, was a military dictatorship run by colonels who dreamed of a reborn Polish Empire. Nazi Germany, typical of fascist states, existed in a fantasy world generated by propagandists and headed by an inept demagogue and was not prepared at all to take on the forces allegedly arrayed against it. Hitler’s government was on the verge of collapse, and had the British and French actually intended to defend the nutso Polish policies, the French could have been in Berlin by Halloween in 1940. Stalin may have been paranoid, but given that everybody was out to get him, it’s pretty hard to judge one way or the other. My great uncle was drafted out of the hillbilly country of the Ottawa Valley and sent to Canada’s fledgling colony in Sibera, along with the Royal Bank, in 1919, as Russia was just one more region to be ripped off by the colonial “pillars of democracy” who fought the Great War, episodes 1 and 2. To accept the Second World War as some morally upright exception to the 9000-year history of state violence takes exceptional evidence, and there is a real dearth of that stuff.

It is true the Soviet Union contributed greatly to the allied effort in World War II. Of course, not directly on D-Day in Normandy and it hasn’t actually existed as a country since the 1990’s, so Mr. Putin is not the leader of the Soviet Union and never has been. Yes, there is a connection to D-Day, but it is a roundabout one.

Of course, the Soviet Union wasn’t fighting its heroic battle out of altruism for the west, it was just fighting to save its own country, same as the western allies were not fighting for the Soviets. It was an alliance of convenience that ended quickly after the war, the west didn’t like Stalin or trust him and the feeling was probably mutual. It probably fairly describes the relationship since then between the west and the Soviet Union and now Russia, although sometimes better, sometimes worse.

I understand the Soviet Union had ceremonies to commemorate significant moments in World War II for them . I think Russia and possibly other former Soviet countries continue this without much, if any, involvement from the west. It could also be argued that the military and financial support the west gave to the Soviet Union in the early 1940’s helped save their country. It was a mutually beneficial alliance, perhaps a temporary and convenient one, but none the less a real one. One could argue neither the west or the Soviet Union could have defeated Germany on its own, so a case could be made for including someone from the eastern front in the D Day remembrances. However, given the indirect involvement I could also understand not including Russia in this.

An excellent piece and reminder all around who really took down Hitler. The Soviet Union had pressured the rest of the Allies to invade Northern Europe to relieve them a little, but the West took their own sweet time doing it. Then claimed all the credit to the folks back home when victory was finally gained.

I lost family in WW2 and can only applaud the superb response of our Canadian soldiers from D Day till war’s end, fighting someone else’s war if truth be told. In fact, I’ve enjoyed incredible hospitality in both North Eastern France and Holland back in the early ’70s when people learned I was Canadian. Over the top thanks that made me weep. People there remembered our troops with complete fondness. Can anyone say better than that for the sacrifice they made and the liberation they brought? It was appreciated beyond measure. Worth commemorating without doubt, all the more because it brought no ideology at the foot soldier level, just regular people, and I believe the gratitude I received reflected what those French and Dutch appreciated most about the Canadians – selflessness and right against wrong with no expectation of praise, but serious and to the point in chasing the enemy out. Yup, a pretty damn good show.

I have had the same experience in Holland, Bill. People going way out of their way to help me because, well, I was a Canadian and Canadians (like my Uncle Dave Garratt, after whom I was named, not that they knew that bit) helped liberate their country. It was particularly moving when a nice man who had given me directions shyly asked me if I was Irish. (Red beard, in those days.) Actually, I’m Canadian, I responded, at which point half a dozen people who had overheard materialized at my side, anxious to help. Someone even apologized for not recognizing I was a Canadian! And, yes, it made me weep too. DJC

In 2005 my wife and I visited Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery in southern Holland. When we arrived we encountered an older Dutch woman, all by herself, putting flowers on the soldiers’ graves. She did it entirely on her own initiative; she wasn’t part of a group, nor did she receive any recognition for doing it; she was just expressing her own gratitude.

It’s is indeed true that the Soviet people made enormous sacrifices in the Second World War, not only at the front against Nazi Germany but on the home front, as their country mobilized and industrialized to meet the equipment and materiel demands of mid-20th-century mechanized warfare. But, here is one unpleasant truth about their sacrifices: it’s not as if they had any choice in the matter. The Germany-USSR theatre of the war was not democracy combating dictatorship, as in Western Europe, but two brutal dictatorships fighting each other. Joseph Stalin was a brutal and oppressive dictator long before Adolph Hitler became Chancellor of Germany: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin

Just before the outbreak of the war, Stalin’s government concluded the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, which freed up Hitler to invade Poland—which the Pact actually split up between Germany & the Soviet Union. This was the final act that led the Western European Allies to finally give up on diplomacy and shift to a military solution: Clausewitz’s “pursuit of policy by other means”. Stalin remained nominally an ally of Hitler right up to the moment the first panzers crossed into Russia in Operation Barbarossa. Stalin didn’t become an ally of the West because he genuinely believed in their cause; he did so because “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” and so was essentially forced into the alliance. In fact, in the Pacific theatre, he stayed out of the war with Japan until the day after the Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, just so he could say he was in on the Allied victory there.

So, yes, let’s acknowledge the sacrifices and heroism of the peoples of the countries that once made up the Soviet Union—Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and the rest—but let’s not glorify the brutal dictator who forced those sacrifices on them.

Funny stuff. The “democracies” consisted of the British and French empires. The French were content to rearm the Imperial Japanese in Indochina to regain their colonies. The Dutch got busy killing Indonesians by ‘46 in their colony. The US openly joined the war when the naval base on islands they stole at gunpoint from the Hawaiians was bombed. The US generals having to switch gears from crushing their former subordinates in the Bonus Army. The US wiped out a half million or so Filipinos when they stole the remnants of the clapped-out Spanish Empire, not to mention the last state murders of the Plains Indians occurred less than fifty years before the start of Great War 2. Don’t get me started on plucky little Belgium.

This is a preview of Canada’s future if Justin Trudeau is re-elected as prime minister, as he continues to implement his terrible anti-automobile agenda.”

Were I to take to Twitter and say such a thing, dear readers, presumably many of you would conclude that I had gone over the edge. In the absence of hints this was done for comedic effect, you might be justified.


Senator Denise Batters and an American friend, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Photo: Supplied to CBC by an unspecified political office).

I give you, then, Sen. Denise Batters, an actual member of Canada’s Upper House, the Chamber of Sober Second Thought, as it was declared to be by Sir John A. Macdonald, a Conservative politician of the old school although one not normally remembered for sobriety.

Sen. Batters is a Regina lawyer who once served as the chief of staff a Saskatchewan Party justice minister. She was appointed to the Senate by prime minister Stephen Harper in 2013 and it would be fair to say she is known for intemperate remarks on Twitter and other social media sites.

Still, she outdid herself on Saturday, when she tweeted: “Major power outage in SE #Regina right now. This is a preview of Canada’s future if Justin Trudeau is re-elected, as he continues to implement his terrible anti-energy industry agenda. #C69 #C48 #carbonTAX”

Lacking any evidence that this was done for comedic effect, many Twitter users concluded Sen. Batters had gone over the edge, prompting a lot of mockery. Certainly that is a plausible explanation under the circumstances. I am not so sure, however, so bear with me.

Consider this from Jason Kenney, premier of Alberta and a former minister in Mr. Harper’s cabinet: “It appears quite possible I inherited the NDP’s second recession,” he told his favourite Postmedia stenographer late last week. He accused the NDP of lying about the state of the province’s finances in the same screed. He has tweeted much the same thing.

Similarly, in his victory speech on the night of April 16, Mr. Kenney accused “foreign-funded special interests” of “leading a campaign of economic sabotage against this great province.” He has repeated this claim numerous times on social media.


Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his federal friend, Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andre Forget, Andrew Scheer Flickr).

Neither assertion is supported by much evidence.

Or ponder these words from Doug Ford, Mr. Kenney’s sentence-finishing bromantic partner and the Conservative premier of Ontario, who Tweeted without irony on Sunday: “Our government has accomplished more in 12 months than any other government in Ontario’s history.”

Seriously? Seriously?

Does this all sound familiar? Does this all ring a Bell, as it were?

Of course it does. Because, considered together, this is Trumpism of the first water.

There is a pattern here: Bizarre and illogical accusations about political opponents’ supposedly conspiratorial connections and intentions; attempts to identify and persecute scapegoats for real and imagined crises; and fantastic claims unsupported by evidence. Plus, of course, an endless stream of outright, knowing lies. All of it amplified by weaponized social media and compliant right-wing mainstream media.

It all fits the disinformation-loop strategy perfected by Donald Trump and the Republican Party south of the Medicine Line, and imported to Canada by the new post-Reform Party Conservatives of Mr. Harper, Sen. Batters, Mr. Kenney, Mr. Ford and federal Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer.

It’s easy to mock such disinformation a tweet at a time. It’s not so easy to undo the corrosive effect over time.

With a federal election looming and Conservative trolls in full throat, Canadians should take this very seriously indeed. We’ve already seen what’s happened, and is still happening, south of the 49th Parallel. It can happen here too, and very well may.

Indeed, it’s already happening in Alberta as the New Conspiracism transforms itself into the New McCarthyism as Mr. Kenney’s War Room becomes the House Un-Albertan Activities Committee.

Which is why I don’t think Ms. Batters is batty. I think she’s reading from a script. Unfortunately, it’s a script we now know works pretty well","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">I give you, then, Sen. Denise Batters, an actual member of Canada’s Upper House, the Chamber of Sober Second Thought, as it was declared to be by Sir John A. Macdonald, a Conservative politician of the old school although one not normally remembered for sobriety.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sen. Batters is a Regina lawyer who once served as the chief of staff a Saskatchewan Party justice minister. She was appointed to the Senate by prime minister Stephen Harper in 2013 and it would be fair to say she is known for intemperate remarks on Twitter and other social media sites.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, she outdid herself on Saturday, when <a href=""https://twitter.com/denisebatters/status/1137395082686939137"">she tweeted</a>: <i>“Major power outage in SE #Regina right now. This is a preview of Canada’s future if Justin Trudeau is re-elected, as he continues to implement his terrible anti-energy industry agenda. #C69 #C48 #carbonTAX”</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Lacking any evidence that this was done for comedic effect, many Twitter users concluded Sen. Batters had gone over the edge, prompting a lot of mockery. Certainly that is a plausible explanation under the circumstances. I am not so sure, however, so bear with me.</p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">Consider <a href=""https://calgarysun.com/opinion/columnists/bell-ndp-lied-about-albertas-finances-declares-kenney"">this from Jason Kenney,</a> premier of Alberta and a former minister in Mr. Harper’s cabinet: <i>“</i></span><i>It appears quite possible I inherited the NDP’s second recession,”</i> he told his favourite Postmedia stenographer late last week. He accused the NDP of lying about the state of the province’s finances in the same screed. He has <a href=""https://twitter.com/jkenney/status/1137061385840410624"">tweeted</a> much the same thing.</p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">Similarly, in his victory speech on the night of April 16, Mr. Kenney accused “</span>foreign-funded special interests” of “leading a campaign of economic sabotage against this great province.” He has repeated this claim numerous times on social media.</p>

<p class=""p4"">Seriously? <i>Seriously?</i></p>
<p class=""p4"">Does this all sound familiar? Does this all ring a Bell, as it were?</p>
<p class=""p4"">Of course it does. Because, considered together, this is Trumpism of the first water.</p>
<p class=""p4"">There is a pattern here: Bizarre and illogical accusations about political opponents’ supposedly conspiratorial connections and intentions; attempts to identify and persecute scapegoats for real and imagined crises; and fantastic claims unsupported by evidence. Plus, of course, an endless stream of outright, knowing lies. All of it amplified by weaponized social media and compliant right-wing mainstream media.</p>
<p class=""p4"">It all fits the disinformation-loop strategy perfected by Donald Trump and the Republican Party south of the Medicine Line, and imported to Canada by the new post-Reform Party Conservatives of Mr. Harper, Sen. Batters, Mr. Kenney, Mr. Ford and federal Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer.</p>
<p class=""p4"">It’s easy to mock such disinformation a tweet at a time. It’s not so easy to undo the corrosive effect over time.</p>
<p class=""p4"">With a federal election looming and Conservative trolls in full throat, Canadians should take this very seriously indeed. We’ve already seen what’s happened, and is still happening, south of the 49<sup>th</sup> Parallel. It can happen here too, and very well may.</p>

No doubt we are going to be hearing a lot about “foreign funded” environmentalists from the War Room but we won’t be hearing much about our “foreign controlled” oil sands which spirits the bitumen and most of the profits out of the country leaving a big hole in the ground which we Albertans squabble over.

Apparently this War Room is nothing new. The Albertans govt used to have a Public Affairs Bureau and in it was a section promoting the oil sands. Only the name has changed.

South of the border a former aid to Hillary Clinton says she’s threatening to get into the 2020 race if the Dems stray to far to the left. Deplorable.

It’s a simple risk reward strategy. If there is no downside or opprobrium for telling a lie, then why talk about the truth. The truth is always freighted with some sort of unpleasant reality; it never measures up to the fantasy.

The question then becomes why is there no punishment for these liars and charlatans?

Any credibility conservatives have on free speech is undone each time a nut like @jkenney turns the resources of the state against individuals voicing their opinions, declaring them, in effect, enemies of the state.

This turn is scary. It’s unConservative and unAlbertan.

Interesting that Kenney is going to try and blame his upcoming recession on the NDP. The sad part is most of his supporters will actually believe him rather than admit he really has no idea what he is doing. Looking at his record as part of the conservative government he is out of his depth unless there is a bubble out there he can inflate as a premier I don’t know about. Housing bubble, that’s pretty much run its course Flaherty added air and the Liberals are clueless in their attempts. Oil, perhaps a war with Iran will inflate that one but most still remember Libya and not much a premier can do to start a war. If he could monetize the senseless rage he inflated to get elected perhaps that would do it. Sorry Mr. Kenney you will own this one it’s time to look in the mirror.

The only thing new about this rubbish is the role of social media. We wallow in a massive bog of misrepresentation from those who control the game, and we always have. A small anti-thesis was permitted, within certain parameters, to exist between 1945 and approximately 2000, but those days are gone as the Empire lurches into a new paradigm, which is the struggle to maintain unipolarity in the face of a bona fide challenge from Eurasia. I find this “new conspiracism” to be about as credible as the right-wing allegations about virtue-signalling, the precarious state of the “white man”, etc. We are the subject of conspiracies from our masters, all the time. The single biggest crime against humanity since 2000 was the destruction of Iraq. Was that not the result of a conspiracy? How about the financial collapse in 2010? No conspiracy involved? Who went to jail or the gallows for either of those?
There is a conspiracy afoot realted to the international traffic in hydrocarbons, as there has been since Rockefeller took control of the transportation of oil out of the Pennsylvania shale and the Royal Navy switched over from wind. Do people believe that the skull-duggery involved in Imperial energy acquisition, the single most pressing issue for empires since the time of Sumer, disappeared? Hint: hydro-carbons replaced slavery.
The Vietnam War, supposedly occurring at the peak of the virtuous phase of the US Empire, was one sloppy collage of conspiracies. With regard to the one that everybody likes to pretend came straight out of the realm of the tinfoil hat in 2001, it is indisputable that the state appartatus of the Western democracies participated directly in the murder of their fellow citizens during Operation Gladio in the seventies. Yet when a group of men known tied to known US state intelligence assets commit a crime, only the crazies could allege the direct involvement of US intelligence. So what exactly is the evidence that supports this notion that we’re subject now to cuckoo conspiracy theories?
The right is composed of fascists or those duped by fascists, and there is no “moderate” group of conservatives, in this country or any other in this particular universe. And it’s not new.

My father-in-law read a stat from the paper to me over breakfast one morning: “twenty percent of Canadians dislike Americans.” He thought it humorous when I quipped, “more like twenty percent of each Canadian dislikes Americans.”

Many years later I was reminded of my now-departed father-in-law’s laughter when JT’s popularity surged through no effort of his own but, rather, merely because Donald tRump had publicly insulted him in (where else?) a tweet, post G-whiz conference, calling our PM “dishonest” and “weak” and “You can’t do that [to me], Justin…gonna cost [Canadians] a lot of money.” Indeed, within nanoseconds Canadian Conservatives ‘pivoted’ in their normally derisive tone toward our PM—that is, they assumed a straight-backed, if insincere, patriotic tone, politically forced to marshal to his defence. My father-in-law would have laughed at that bit of theatre, too, because it rather illustrated my point: even neoliberal-addled neo-rightists understand the deep, abiding enmity most, if not all, Canadians feel towards our greatest ally and trading partner (I felt the rankle recently, for example, when tRump’s stupid tariff threat against Mexico was reported by US news media as a threat against America’s “largest trading partner [Mexico]”—by PBS, no less—because, as every Canadian knows, that superlative still belongs with our country and, as usual, we take exception to the slightest American sleight).

I was astounded when Con leader Andrew Scheer appeared to endorse neo-Nazis during an anti-Trudeau truck rally. What a huge mistake, I thought as I awaited abject apology for being captured in news video with anti-immigration (dog-whistle frequency-lowered-translation = ‘anti-immigrant’) protesters carrying placards emblazoned with demands to hang (yes, hang by the neck until dead) the young PM for, of all things, “treason” (I just pray JT’s children didn’t have to see it on TV). But darned if I wasn’t even more astounded when Scheer appeared unapologetic and, indeed, has subsequently been associated by way of his own MPs and co-partisan provincial politicians with acts and statements that tend to confirm this resort to odious, age-old demagoguery against the perennial, imaginary “Other.”

Not only that, it’s just sooooo American, especially since the ascent of Donald T Rump. What in the world are all these Canadian neo-rightists thinking when they proudly read from the tRumpian playbook? Are they tempting fate?

Wait a minute! I hear some people saying the tRump playtweet “works pretty well.” After all, The Orange One did win the presiduncy and some of his Canadian apers of The Orange have employed his Twitterisms to victorious electoral effect, namely Alberta’s Jason KeKKenney and Ontario’s D’ohfo. I suppose it might look like the tRump playbook works pretty well from a certain point-of-view, like, to paraphrase Einstein, if one imagines looking at the world while riding the leading edged of a beam of shite.

Remind that none of these twitter twits has completed a single, four-year term: JKKK’s only begun his, D’ohfo just a year in, and The Donald in his third. IMHO, we’ll have to wait see if their respective electorates think of their terms as working pretty well. And it rather seems it hasn’t, not so much in the US of A, nor in Ontario where the D’ohfo’s popularity has tanked below that of his vanquished predecessor who’d held the record-low rating hitherto— Alberta’s tRumperoid government is still too new to tell how much voters will approve of the irritable, snarling mien their premier has costumed them on the world stage. (Forgive me if I can’t think of a Canadian equivalent to Yosemite Sam. With talk of Alberta separatism still circulating on social media, I don’t think JKKK quite qualifies anyway.)

But, I agree: on the national level, the distended, twittering bowels of the American man-child do present a frightful possibility: that we Canadians will become like or more like—instead of merely aping—our American cousins. But remember, we have the benefit (I can’t believe I’m saying this) of having had the HarperCons (take ten deep breaths—okay:) of which our American neighbours had never seen the like—until now with tRump. Remember how ‘well’ Harper’s tactics worked: by the time he won a majority, his government was beset by prosecutions for electoral cheating, his lacklustre legislation was regularly being struck down by the SCoC, his centrepiece pipeline policy turned into a pipe dream, and the First Nations he tried to railroad had organized the most spontaneous, nationwide protest movement in Canadian history, Idle-No-More, which nailed that door shut with a single log across the transcontinental railway track. Then his first majority was his last.

There’s more evidence that tRump, JKKK and D’ohfo will meet this same fate that not. Why so surprised? They’re all ideological neo-right absurdists who yield net negatives for ordinary citizens. Nothing they prescribe will ameliorate the challenges of our times. Certainly not the imaginary ones.

I’m waiting for the Orange One to insert himself into the Canadian federal election. If it doesn’t occur to him, maybe an anybody-but-Con sympathizer will put the twitter bug in his ear. As it happens, the lengthy nature of US presidential elections has coincidentally lined-up our two nations’ federal contests, side by side like Ben Hur and Massala, which is a good thing, IMHO, because, as if we don’t already sniff up our smug Canadian sleeves at American political crudity, it will remind us of what The Orange goof’s Canadian apers— especially its brown-dwarf star in this darkening political atmosphere—have in mind for our fair country. It’s a gonna be some great TV.

As the Dems lose their shirts and loose their skirts in their embarrassing embarrassment of partisan riches pitted against a stubborn 40% tRumpularity nut to crack, I expect the Canadian right to forget about our twenty percent. That’s a nut that’s never been cracked.

It seems these days the world has a case of political vertigo. After being discedited for about half a century, the era of the big lie seems to be back with a vengance again.

It seems the more outrageous the accusation the more willing some politicians seem to make or spread it these days It seems to have worked fairly well for Trump in the US and now it seems to be catching on with the Trump wannabes in Canada. I suppose as the saying goes, immitation is the highest form of flattery.

I suppose therefore it shouldn’t be a surprise in their unrelenting effort to demonize Trudeau and the Federal Liberals, some Conservative is now essentially blaming him for a recent power outage in Regina. As ridiculous as that sounds, remember the UCP was fairly succesful in blaming Trudeau and the Federal Liberals for all that ails Alberta and whipping up a frenzy about it convenienly just in advance of our recent provincial election.

Another election is coming up soon, so expect another blizzard of more outrageous and self serving political lies. Don’t expect too much scrutiny of this by what passes for or remains of the mainstream media.

Maybe we need a war room to fight against the big poltical lies, that seem to be increasingly common these days, as much or more than we need a war room for our energy industry.

Many readers not directly hostile to unions nevertheless may have wondered, “What’s the big deal? The government’s just asking for a little time.”

Let me explain.


United Nurses of Alberta President Heather Smith (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Once Bill 9, the Public Sector Arbitration Deferral Act introduced in the Legislature yesterday by Finance Minister Travis Toews, is passed – a certainty in a United-Conservative-Party-majority Legislature – it will postpone the start of any arbitration hearings until after Halloween, and suspend hearings that are already underway until the same scary day.

The legislation will impact 24 collective agreements covering roughly 180,000 public sector employees, some of them directly employed by the government but most by public agencies like Alberta Health Services.

Despite the government’s narrative that this is just a short procedural delay while its recently appointed “blue-ribbon” panel gets a handle on the province’s financial situation, union members have sound reasons to worry about what the government is up to.

This is because it is neither hyperbolic nor tendentious to declare that the government’s motives in introducing a law that breaks important terms and conditions of legal contracts should be transparent to even a casual observer.

First, while the UCP narrative doesn’t state this explicitly, halting arbitration hearings is obviously intended to prevent one thing, and one thing alone. To wit: arbitrators giving public employees like nurses a raise.

The urgency for a government that has already decided to attack public sector salaries is that many Alberta public employees’ unions negotiated “wage reopener” agreements in their current contracts, which have now reached the point these wages-only negotiations are about to start or are already underway.


Alberta Union of Provincial Employees President Guy Smith (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Typically, if the parties to a wage-reopener can’t reach an agreement in collective bargaining, compulsory binding arbitration is triggered.

The problem with that for a government like the UCP is that arbitrators have to make their decisions based on facts like comparable salaries paid to other workers, the cost of living, and the employer’s finances – not on neoliberal ideology and hostility to the public sector and unions.

So by tearing up this inconvenient part of the agreements signed just over two years ago by several unions, the government gives itself time to plot its next moves.

Obviously, on its face, the Act allows the government to breach a key part of collective agreements like those of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, United Nurses of Alberta, the Health Sciences Association of Alberta and the Alberta Teachers Association.

When those contracts were negotiated, members agreed to multiple years of frozen wages in return for the ability to negotiate a wage increase in the final year of the contract. So Bill 9 strips the contracts of the provision on which members’ agreement to a wage freeze was based.

Imagine the brouhaha in the private sector and among Conservative parties if an NDP government, say, had told a contractor that a provision in its contract that allowed periodic renegotiation of its fees had been nullified by legislation!

It also seems obvious on its face that arbitrary state meddling in legal contracts like that in Bill 9 violates the constitutional protection of collective bargaining rights enshrined by the Supreme Court of Canada. This is what public sector unions are talking about when they say their members’ constitutional rights are being violated, and it will inevitably be tested in the courts. The results are predictable, although that will take time.


Alberta Teachers Association President Greg Jeffrey (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Meanwhile, the government has bought time to entrench its narrative through the work of the so-called “blue-ribbon” panel into Alberta’s finances headed by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon, which will report in late summer after what in such a time frame can only be a cursory look at the books.

The evidence of her own past words suggests Dr. MacKinnon’s conclusions are foreordained – she and her fellow panelists will call for something like she has already advocated, wage rollbacks followed by wage freezes based on a tendentious interpretation of the province’s fiscal state.

Moreover, whatever its members’ inclinations, the panel’s mandate is rigged to prevent it from reaching a fair conclusion – it’s not permitted to consider the revenue side of Alberta’s financial predicament, nor is it allowed to trifle with the UCP’s big corporate tax cuts.

Readers may wonder: Why wouldn’t the government just bull ahead and impose its desired rollbacks and freezes now on the public sector right now?

This is a good question, and the answer is obvious from the time lines of the legislation and the actions of the radical agenda the UCP promised its base during the spring election campaign.

Canada’s provincial Conservative governments have torn a page from the Republican campaign playbook south of the 49th Parallel and are now all participating in a national campaign paid for by their taxpayers to unseat the Liberal federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

What do you think Premier Jason Kenney’s “war room” and its advertising campaigns in other provinces are all about? Why do you think Mr. Kenney is now spending so much time outside Alberta? Why do you think his bromantic partner, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, is in virtual hiding now that his approval ratings have taken a deep dive?

There’s no way the UCP or other governments in the Canadian Axis of Conservatism will risk passing legislation offensive enough to become part of the federal campaign in the critical battleground of Ontario until the national election is over.

After that, all bets are off.

In the mean time, Bill 9 freezes negotiations so no arbitrator can properly do his or her job and allow collective bargaining to function as the Constitution and the Supreme Court say it should.

This is why public sector union presidents like Heather Smith of UNA, Mike Parker of HSAA, Guy Smith of AUPE and Greg Jeffrey of the ATA were lined up in the Legislature yesterday to condemn Bill 9’s historic interference in free collective bargaining","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p3"">The evidence of her own past words suggests Dr. MacKinnon’s conclusions are foreordained – she and her fellow panelists will call for something like she has already advocated, wage rollbacks followed by wage freezes based on a tendentious interpretation of the province’s fiscal state.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Moreover, whatever its members’ inclinations, the panel’s mandate is rigged to prevent it from reaching a fair conclusion – it’s not permitted to consider the revenue side of Alberta’s financial predicament, nor is it allowed to trifle with the UCP’s big corporate tax cuts.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Readers may wonder: Why wouldn’t the government just bull ahead and impose its desired rollbacks and freezes now on the public sector right now?</p>
<p class=""p3"">This is a good question, and the answer is obvious from the time lines of the legislation and the actions of the radical agenda the UCP promised its base during the spring election campaign.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Canada’s provincial Conservative governments have torn a page from the Republican campaign playbook south of the 49<sup>th</sup> Parallel and are now all participating in a national campaign paid for by their taxpayers to unseat the Liberal federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p class=""p3"">What do you think Premier Jason Kenney’s “war room” and its advertising campaigns in other provinces are all about? Why do you think Mr. Kenney is now spending so much time outside Alberta? Why do you think his bromantic partner, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, is in virtual hiding now that his approval ratings have taken a deep dive?</p>
<p class=""p3"">There’s no way the UCP or other governments in the Canadian Axis of Conservatism will risk passing legislation offensive enough to become part of the federal campaign in the critical battleground of Ontario until the national election is over.</p>
<p class=""p3"">After that, all bets are off.</p>
<p class=""p3"">In the mean time, Bill 9 freezes negotiations so no arbitrator can properly do his or her job and allow collective bargaining to function as the Constitution and the Supreme Court say it should.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is why public sector union presidents like Heather Smith of UNA, Mike Parker of HSAA, Guy Smith of AUPE and </span>Greg Jeffrey of the ATA were lined up in the Legislature yesterday to condemn Bill 9’s historic interference in free collective bargaining.</p>

Serious question: does Bill 9 as currently before the Legislature contain any “notwithstanding clause” language?

The elephant-in-the-room question. The answer is yes. The section of the Charter the unions argue Bill 9 violates would be Section 2.d., freedom of association. Section 33.1. states, “Parliament or the legislature of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 to 15 of this Charter.” There you go.

With apologies to George Santayana: Those who fail to remember Alberta labour history are doomed to repeat it.

1995 was the year Alberta Premier Ralph Klein blinked — big time! Triggered by wildcat strikes from courageous lowly-paid Calgary hospital laundry workers (most of whom were immigrant women), Klein bit off more than he had bargained for. The laundry workers were forced to take job action to combat Klein’s reckless privatization agenda that had targeted their jobs. Eventually labour support coalesced in six hospitals and nine nursing homes across the province with over 2,500 healthcare workers joining in solidarity work-to-rule campaigns. The David and Goliath struggle ended with a reprieve on the axing laundry workers’ jobs and Klein added $100 million back into the health care budget, which had been severely cut in previous years.

By the comments made yesterday from Alberta’s labour leaders, it would appear that the labour union mantra of “No Justice — No Peace” is about to ring throughout the province once again. Jason Kenney promised a back-to-the-future conservative government. Promise made — promise kept. He’d better brace for the political and labour fallout.

Hmm appears I was right, I was talking with a few people and came to the conclusion, Kenney “wins” either way. 1. It gets fought through the courts and he wins. 2. It gets fought and the Public Sector workers “win” and the bill/act gets repealed. Either way Kenney gets the delay he wants. The only “hope” is that the Unions can push for a emergent hearing in the courts to get this in right away.

Worth trying, but unlikely to succeed. It would be very difficult for the unions to prove there was the potential for irreparable harm since a court would probably say, “if you win, your members will get their money eventually.” Where’s Mr. Justice Denny Thomas when you need him?

Ask British Columbians what happens when signed contracts are torn up: for purely ideological reasons and against legal advice, then-education minister Christy Clark did just that to the contract teachers had signed with the previous NDP government in order the new, BC Liberal regime impose changes to its terms unilaterally. The move initiated a decade of lawsuits, all of which the neo-right government lost at a cost of millions of dollars to the public purse—and eventually millions in fines the regime had to pay (also at public expense) for continuing to appeal what had legally been confirmed and reconfirmed as unconstitutional and indefensible. Worst of all, almost a full K-12 cohort of students was deprived by the BC Liberal cuts and changes while the case was at trial and appeals, with the government knowing its actions were illegal all along.

Budgetary difficulty in paying for the court-ordered compliance with the original contract was just one of the many problems the neo-right regime bequeathed to the Green-Dipper government that replaced it.

It was a disastrous policy: the BC Liberals knew all along it was illegal to tear up legal contracts, it gamed the judicial system to the max until the court punished it with fines and ordered it to pay the teachers their legal due while legal costs were charged to citizens. Small wonder many observed that this perfidy was tantamount to willful, ideologically motivated sabotage of legal principle, public-sector collective bargaining, teachers’ pay and working conditions, students’ education, and the public weal. It was, in fact, a massive breach of public trust and a total failure.

It contributed to the BC Liberals’ electoral defeat and to fiscal challenges the new government inherited. It might take quite a while for the BC Liberals to live it down—maybe, taking into account the many other ideologically motivated perfidies this far neo-right party inflicted on British Columbians, an eternity.

Christy left politics for several years after tearing up the teachers’ contract, but returned to win the BC Liberal leadership when premier Gordon Campbell was forced to resign in disgrace. One of the cabinet ministers who’d stuck it out while Christy was hosting a talk-radio show was George Abbott. After losing the leadership contest (by a close margin) to the policy-incompetent prancing majorette, Abbott left politics and quit the party because, among other things, Christy petulantly resumed defending the mess she’d created years before. He recently completed a PhD thesis in which he condemns such neo-right excesses as he witnessed in the BC Liberal cabinet.

The BC Liberals, he confirmed, knew tearing up contracts was wrong. I’m not sure he characterized it as a massive breach of trust, but Alberta’s UCP government should give it a read, anyway.

Not to mention ripping up the healthcare workers’ contract by Campbell; ironically these acts followed the livid ideolog8ical attacks on the NDP for varying a single contract (Carrier Lumber) because of indigenous rights in the Chilcotin.

“Imagine the brouhaha in the private sector and among Conservative parties if an NDP government, say, had told a contractor that a provision in its contract that allowed periodic renegotiation of its fees had been nullified by legislation!”

The power purchase agreements – and this resulted in massive expenses for Albertans by triggering a buyback.

Markb: That was because the NDP were too stupid (some might say ‘ethical’) to use the supremacy of the Legislature to specify in the legislation that no compensation is owed on the Power Purchase Agreements. There is a lot of cunning in the UCP, but ethical constraints? Not so much in my view. So-called legal constraints? The UCP know very well that while the Courts and the Charter of Rights are great and wondrous things, they are also so remote in time and space as to be meaningless in the here and now of the election cycle.

Tout le monde Conservative Alberta was reeling over the weekend at Friday’s news from Rome that Pope Francis, leader of 1.3 billion Catholics, has declared global warming to be a real thing and putting a price on carbon to be “essential” to saving the planet.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

At a closed-door meeting of the Vatican’s Academy of Sciences, a concept that at some points in the Church’s history would have been oxymoronic, His Holiness sternly lectured the CEOs of Royal Dutch Shell, Eni, BP, Repsol, Conoco Phillips, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and executives of sundry investment funds to get with the program and stop standing in the way of planetary salvation.

This has to be causing some consternation in the circles closest to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, the “former WASP” and convert to Roman Catholicism who for many years has been portraying himself as more Catholic than the pope.

Up to now, this may have appeared compatible with the premier’s crusade against carbon taxes, the heart of his passive-aggressive attack on climate science in which he halfheartedly acknowledges the reality global temperatures are rising while doing everything he can to deny the obvious reason for it.

Hitherto, Mr. Kenney has seemed like the sort of fellow who reckons the Inquisition was on the right track in 1633 when it threatened to torture Galileo Galilei to make him recant his notion the earth revolves around the sun, rather than the other way around.

What is Mr. Kenney to do now that the infallible Pontifex of Rome has damned – only metaphorically, so far – those who ignore the perils scientists say the planet faces?


Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andre Forget, Andrew Scheer Flickr).

Could he turn his back on the teachings of the Bishop of Rome when they don’t suit him – as he once accused the Jesuits at the University of San Francisco of doing when they had the temerity to support the right of women on campus to speak freely in support of their reproductive rights? Alert readers will recall that the young Mr. Kenney tried to get the church to declare the institution could not call itself a Catholic university, then dropped out when that didn’t work.

Maybe he could return to his roots in the Anglican Church. Not much satisfaction there, alas. These days Anglicans are all for ordaining women and welcoming LGBTQ folk.

Or maybe the answer would be to set up his own church with his sanctimonious self as pope. I have to tell you, though, it’s been done. At least half the time, that’s basically what that Protestant thing Mr. Kenney abandoned in his early years was about.

And what about United Conservative Party ministers like Adriana LaGrange, the fiercely anti-abortion holder of the education portfolio in Mr. Kenney’s cabinet? Will this former Catholic school board chair argue the pope is right about abortion and homosexuality and wrong about climate change? That would make her almost as inconsistent as those evangelicals who take everything in the Bible literally except the bits that they don’t.


Galileo Galilei, portrait by Justus Sustermans, 1636 (Image: Public Domain).

Whatever will Ms. LaGrange do if Pope Francis declares that teachers in Roman Catholic schools have an obligation to teach climate science? Yikes!

Then there’s federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, another piously Roman Catholic constant carbon-tax complainer. No word from him yet, either, on Friday’s papal carbon commentary.

Meanwhile, it would be interesting to be a fly on the wall in Mr. Kenney’s mighty “war room” as its leaders brainstorm ways to take on the Church of Rome and squeeze the pontiff till his pips squeak. After all, there are still plenty of pips in the coffers of Rome! And if you count the Swiss Guard, the pope’s got more divisions than Mr. Kenney has, too.

I suppose the war roomers could threaten to make the Church pay taxes if His Holiness won’t stay in his lane – if only that could be described as something other than a tax increase.

Talk about awkward.

Fortunately for Mr. Kenney and his Catholic caucus and cabinet members, the pope hasn’t made his latest pronouncement on carbon taxes official doctrine. Yet. But who knows, another papal encyclical may be in the works, which really would leave the pious premier in the position of having to choose between glory to God and death to the carbon tax.

It’s not hard to predict what Mr. Kenney and his sanctimonious ilk would do. Catholic Conservatives in Canada have basically been ignoring the last encyclical from Pope Francis on this topic, in 2015.

Still, Pope Francis was pretty clear on Friday. “Faced with a climate emergency, we must take action accordingly, in order to avoid perpetrating a brutal act of injustice towards the poor and future generations,” he said. “We do not have the luxury of waiting for others to step forward, or of prioritizing short-term economic benefits.”

Like Galileo and unlike the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in Calgary, the fossil fuel multinationals’ CEOs in Rome saw the wisdom of bowing their heads and saying they too support a carbon tax.

That sounds about right to me. Mr. Kenney? Mr. Scheer?

149,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,It’s time for a frank talk about the T-word: Just who’s advocating treason here anyway,2019-06-18 01:31:00,David Climenhaga,,"It’s time, my fellow Canadians, for us to have a frank talk about the T-word.

Albertans who have been paying attention to politics for the past few years cannot have missed the fact certain elements of the right-wing ideological ecosystem have been sloppy and irresponsible in their use of terms like “treason” and “traitor” to describe ideas and people they disagree with.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is frequently smeared by the Alberta right as a “traitor” (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

It is impossible in this province not to have heard the right-wing rage machine refer frequently to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former NDP premier Rachel Notley, in this manner.

Conservative politicians like Premier Jason Kenney have been careful not to use this kind of language themselves, but they certainly encourage such rhetoric and attitudes among their supporters when it suits them.

Of course, the “treason” of which Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley were regularly accused didn’t fit the definition in the dictionary or the law. Rather, it amounted to advocating tax and environmental policies with which their accusers disagreed.

Since both Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley were making such remarkable efforts to encourage the success of Alberta’s fossil fuel industry, it seemed at times their sin was not being extreme enough to suit the most hysterical climate-crisis deniers among Canada’s movement conservatives.

In the case of environmentalists and ordinary Canadians in other provinces who had their doubts about Alberta bitumen being shipped through their territory, some well-known voices on the right – including one prominent holder of the Order of Canada, for heaven’s sake – called for their fellow Canadians to be hanged for this crime!


Former Calgary Herald editorialist Danielle Smith, early in her political career (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Needless to say, this does not foster a positive attitude about Alberta ands its fossil fuel industry in other parts of Canada – but in the short term, from the Conservative perspective, it can be said to have helped get Mr. Kenney’s United Conservative Party Government elected, and therefore to have worked.

The defeat of Ms. Notley’s NDP in April, instead of calming things down, though, appears to have driven the right-wing rage machine to new levels of fury.

As is well known, Mr. Kenney has announced he will build a “war room,” to crush democratic dissent at home and, he blusters, elsewhere.

Still infuriated by their loss of control in Ottawa to Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals in 2015, Alberta Conservatives and their allies in other provincial governments have turned the focus of this fury on this fall’s federal election.

In their blind rage, they have raised the spectre of Alberta separatismand the destruction of Canada as a stick with which to beat the rest of Canada and its doubting citizens into submission, or, failing that, to keep voters inclined to support the federal Liberals at home.

Mr. Kenney and his ilk, of course, have once again been very careful about how they phrase such threats, casting themselves as defenders of national unity, which they argue can only be preserved if Alberta’s fossil fuel industry is given carte blanche to do whatever it pleases.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If legislation imposing more rigorous environmental approvals on fossil fuel infrastructure projects and protecting the environmentally sensitive North Coast of British Columbia are passed, Mr. Kenney claimed recently, “this will be inflaming a growing national unity problem in Alberta.”

But for this threat to have any weight, there must be a credible separatist threat to back it up, and Mr. Kenney’s cheering section at Postmedia, on social media and in the mysteriously (foreign?) funded infrastructure of right-wing political action groups has been quick to gin one up.

Postmedia scribes have apparently been working overtime churning out nonsense about the threat of separatism.

“Former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall has compared the government’s environmental assessment bill to kindling, fuelling the flames of Western alienation, and its oil tanker ban to lighter fluid,” wrote the foreign-owned newspaper chain’s John Ivison in a June 6 screed attacking Bills C-69 and C-48.


Calgary Herald Columnist Licia Corbella (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Not even a pipeline will soothe Western ire when this legislation sails through the House,” said the headline on the piece, in case you’re wondering how Postmedia will play a federal decision to approve the Trans Mountain Pipeline today.

“The national unity crisis is real,” screeched Matt Gurney in the same publication on June 12. “Trudeau’s talking point on national unity is dangerously wrong,” said the headline.

Licia Corbella’s hyperventilating meditation on the same Brad Wall observations in the Calgary Herald the next day was headlined: “Will pipeline approval quell western separatism rise caused by Trudeau?” She even trotted out the imaginary “Laurentian elite.”

All this because Mr. Trudeau addressed the elephant in the room and observed, “it’s absolutely irresponsible for conservative premiers to be threatening our national unity if they don’t get their way.”

The day after Ms. Corbella’s effort, the Herald published an unhinged rant by its former editorial writer (and former Wildrose leader) Danielle Smith that bizarrely claimed, “Alberta’s energy industry has solved carbon dioxide,” and went on to trot out the warning that not giving Mr. Kenney his way will ensure “Canada is fractured.”

Then there’s Barry Cooper, another Postmedia perennial, musing on Global TV that we cranky Albertans aren’t just alienated, we’re practically separatists, also citing “Laurentian” boogeymen.


Alberta Economic Development Minister Tanya Fir (Photo: Government of Alberta).

And claiming to be BFFs with members of Mr. Kenney’s cabinet, Craig Chandler, the bad penny of Alberta far-right politics, reappeared on social media to proclaim, “most Albertans want to separate.”

Meanwhile, a mysteriously funded Conservative PAC is running billboards that ask, “Should Alberta ditch Canada?” They provide a link to a website that calls for a separation referendum.

Readers will get the picture.

Now, Mr. Chandler has a history of ludicrous comments and is not exactly a credible source. Nevertheless, he may be onto something this time. To give the man his due, he was campaign manager for Calgary-Peigan UCP MLA Tanya Fir, who is now Mr. Kenney’s minister of economic development.

Obviously, the financial and political oxygen for this fake separatist movement is coming from somewhere to achieve something.

The dictionary, meanwhile, defines treason as “the crime of betraying one’s country,” a notion that can include a multitude of sins.

The Criminal Code of Canada defines treason in part as waging war against Canada, or “any act preparatory thereto.” Treasonous activities defined in Section 46 of the Criminal Code may also include using force or violence to overthrow a provincial government, attacking the sovereign, disclosing “without lawful authority, military or scientific material to agents of a foreign state,” or aiding Canada’s enemies.

I am not, of course, suggesting that Mr. Kenney, other Conservative politicians or their overwrought journalistic supporters are guilty of treason, although I believe many of the things they say and do are extremely irresponsible and potentially harmful to Canada and Canadians. Nor am I saying that simply advocating separatism, no matter how ludicrous one’s arguments, is treason.

Still, given the words of the law passed by the Parliament of Canada, some of these Conservatives’ followers are starting to sail very close to the wind – and not just wing nuts on the fringe if Mr. Chandler is to be believed.

Given the frequent abuse of the T-word in recent Alberta political discourse, surely it’s now reasonable to ask: Just who are the real traitors here","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">
  <p class=""p1"">It’s time, my fellow Canadians, for us to have a frank talk about the T-word.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Albertans who have been paying attention to politics for the past few years cannot have missed the fact certain elements of the right-wing ideological ecosystem have been sloppy and irresponsible in their use of terms like “treason” and “traitor” to describe ideas and people they disagree with.</p>

Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">It is impossible in this province not to have heard the right-wing rage machine refer frequently to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former NDP premier Rachel Notley, in this manner.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Conservative politicians like Premier Jason Kenney have been careful not to use this kind of language themselves, but they certainly encourage such rhetoric and attitudes among their supporters when it suits them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, the “treason” of which Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley were regularly accused didn’t fit the definition in the dictionary or the law. Rather, it amounted to advocating tax and environmental policies with which their accusers disagreed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Since both Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Notley were making such remarkable efforts to encourage the success of Alberta’s fossil fuel industry, it seemed at times their sin was not being extreme enough to suit the most hysterical climate-crisis deniers among Canada’s movement conservatives.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the case of environmentalists and ordinary Canadians in other provinces who had their doubts about Alberta bitumen being shipped through their territory, some well-known voices on the right – including one prominent holder of the Order of Canada, for heaven’s sake – called for their fellow Canadians to be hanged for this crime!</p>

<p class=""p1"">The defeat of Ms. Notley’s NDP in April, instead of calming things down, though, appears to have driven the right-wing rage machine to new levels of fury.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As is well known, Mr. Kenney has announced he will build a “war room,” to crush democratic dissent at home and, he blusters, elsewhere.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still infuriated by their loss of control in Ottawa to Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals in 2015, Alberta Conservatives and their allies in other provincial governments have turned the focus of this fury on this fall’s federal election.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In their blind rage, they have raised the spectre of Alberta separatism<i> and the destruction of Canada</i> as a stick with which to beat the rest of Canada and its doubting citizens into submission, or, failing that, to keep voters inclined to support the federal Liberals at home.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Kenney and his ilk, of course, have once again been very careful about how they phrase such threats, casting themselves as <i>defenders</i> of national unity, which they argue can only be preserved if Alberta’s fossil fuel industry is given <i>carte blanche</i> to do whatever it pleases.</p>

Well, I hate to inform Albertans of the dingbat harumph variety still so enmeshed in the social mores of 70 years ago, but whatever scheme Kenney and the Brains Trust are dreaming up in war-rooms filled with wood smoke has so far been dashed on the rocks of a metaphorical seaswept shore and dissipated without effect. Not a soul of my acquaintance has paid the slightest bit of attention to yet more Alberta whining, a feature for fully forty years on the Canadian political landscape and which blindly passes them by as background noise, much as they do not really notice repeated climate change pronouncements.

The populace is stuffed to the gills with messages from people advocating this and that, and rarely watches standard news broadcasts on TV – local news is far more popular. People watch Trump if he makes some outlandish assertion just to see if the world’s as nuts as they already thought it was. Everyone’s online, chattering away about nothing in particular for pleasure and avoidance of reality, and lining up their own news items if they even have an interest in that direction. Political disengagement reigns supreme. Who wants to be constantly surrounded by depressing BS and intoning bigheads, given their druthers?

The exception is older folk, boomers, whose habits from decades of practice still encompass a spot of national TV news. A lot of progressive bloggers are older people who can for the most part still spell, write a sentence, organize paragraphs and present a logical unity of thought in a post. Younger ones tend to often present a Youtube video made by someone else that they more or less agree with. I personally cannot sit around waiting for some pontificator to get to the point, when an essay could be read in a quarter the time, and if some point becomes unclear then it is easy to refer back to an earlier paragraph. Searching back on a video or podcast is an exercise in frustration that makes one forget the point due to mechanics/lousy interfaces interfering with the message.

So Ersatz Sub Pope Jason The First of Alberta can shake the secession flag as much as he wants and threaten doom, but I daresay the 88% of Canadians who aren’t Albertans couldn’t care less, barring some BCers who don’t feel they should be forced to buy into Alberta’s dream of exporting more diluted bitumen and nascent CO2 through their patch to non-existent Asian markets, like the Mayor of Burnaby, itself no mere hamlet. No amount of screaming and hollering about Alberta’s rights from Jason is going to change their minds just as unctuously pompous judicial decisions upholding some out-of-date provincial rights statute made 150 years ago and of little relevance to today’s realities hold little sway either.

The situation may well come to the fore if the feds ill-advisedly bring in platoons of RCMP, or heaven forbid the troops, to basically shut down all protest as the new pipeline is built. The average social media chatterers will awake and wonder what the hell is going on. It will also become obvious that the dissenting portion of the public’s view is for naught against the state, and all the fine words of democracy amount to nothing when money’s at stake. Who knows how things will unfold? Will Canadians be as acquiescent to naked displays of power as Italians and Germans of 90 years ago were and keep their heads down, with the blame shovelled onto indigenous heads for convenience’s sake? I believe it’s all quite unclear since there are endless tangents for either side to exploit to confuse the masses. And nascent storm troopers with highly racist views panting to give anyone who disagrees a black eye or worse are massing on the sidelines scratching their armpitz, ready to rumble at any sign of discord to fulfil their blighted agendas.

Personally, I don’t give two tosses if Alberta secedes. Nowhere else except in parts of Quebec have I ever encountered such incuriosity at how other Canadians live. All the commentary is inward-turned and after picking out the lint from their belly-buttons, the resulting exposed navel becomes of surpassing interest to the exclusion of anyone else’s.

The constant din about the downturn of Alberta’s oil patch is belied by production figures which constantly trend upwards as anyone who examines production figures available on the NEB webpages can see. But nobody in power in Alberta wants facts, they want a fight, to win, to lord it over others as we further poison ourselves, deny Insurance Industry near-term forecasts of 20% less moisture in the West and 20% more in the East delivered by gut-wrenching storms even as the West burns and crops fail. Let us not debate facts, say those pols, let’s argue and fight instead and ignore the looming outcome of what they have allowed and caused to be done.

We’ve reached a stage where many things are coming to a head. Will we decide to shoot ourselves in the foot and claim lt feels really good? Or will someone with a bit of gravitas and reason come to the fore and guide us through our travails? Past experience and history, which holds little interest for most these days and is thereby dismissed out of hand, argue for the darker force of special interests to prevail. Lots of money can buy lots of propaganda. We want to be supremely happy as we choke ourselves to death while in thrall to the quick buck desecrators of our sovereign resources. I mean, they owe us that much in return, right?

All this pro-pipeline, pro-oil rage is bubbling out while, at the same time, environmentalists, West Coast Indigenous groups and political opponents of the Liberals, including the federal NDP and Green Party and the BC coalition-in-all-but-name government, are demanding the Trudeau government put a halt to expanding Trans-Mountain. Elizabeth May in particular is also demanding an end to fracking, which is an important component of oil & gas extraction activity in much of Western Canada, including right here in the Peace Country.

There does not seem to be any middle ground between the vociferous proponents and equally vociferous opponents of TMX and everything it represents. So, the question that remains is, which decision the Trudeau government makes will lose it more votes, approving TMX or delaying it further? If they approve it, they risk losing important votes in BC, especially the voter-rich Lower Mainland, and in Quebec, which is—as always in Canada—the key to electoral success. If they delay it further, they risk losing votes in provinces that are already electoral wastelands for Liberals, i.e. Alberta & Saskatchewan.

Which choice do you think they will make???

Alberta Separation – what a great way to sell newspapers!

Apparently when Ezra Levant was sued he used as his defense that his writing was for entertainment value. I wonder if Postmedia would use the same argument with regards to Danielle Smith. She has zero formal education in climate science, and I am sure universities would be happy to provide people with scads of expertise on the topic so people could actually become more informed about the topic, but Postmedia runs her ideas instead of someone smart.

As David has acknowledged, true treason is a bit of a stretch, but since conservative supporters have brought up the word, it is fair play to respond in kind. In that vein, people might want to consider this:
Climate change has already caused fire deaths in California and Portugal; a lot of the immigration related deaths we hear about are a result of human migration necessitated by climate change. In the face of that, could active climate change denial, ie, campaigning to prevent governments from trying to reduce it, be regarded as a crime against humanity?

There is little doubt who are the traitors; they are conservatives of every stripe. They have proven themselves to be racists, misogynists, nationalists, traditionalists, corporatists and fascists. None of these characteristics are appropriate in the 21rst century.
Now, they want to kill people and damage property so that a few foreign shareholders and some red-neck rig-pigs can continue their irresponsible and criminal lifestyles. In fact, our conservatives have a ‘War Room’ set up to further exactly this.
What is war? Killing the enemy and destroying enemy property.
Who are they going to war against? Everybody not actively supporting the petro-industry.
What is at stake in this war? Your kids lives and the environment they will live (or die) in.

Make no mistake, these people are deadly serious. You will have to make a choice.

Thank you DC, great post. I think it could be added that essentially no one outside Alberta is likely to believe that there is such a thing as western separatism. No military, no airforce, no harbours. Separate from what?

The last time western separatism reared its head was with the election of exactly one MLA representing the Western Canada Concept in 1982. The WCC took a provincial by-election in Olds-Didsbury winning a previously Social Credit seat. (Gordon Kesler, lost his seat in the ensuing general election later the same year, a near-sweep for the PCs which also saw the demise of Social Credit in the legislature).

Separation talk in Alberta just tells me that Albertans as a whole have bought into the baloney successive conservative governments told us over close to 50 years. What I see is a collective tantrum over being told no…or not even that. Being told there are limits and consequences.

The pundits and politicians in this province have stoked the flames much like the Republicans in the US. I do understand the angst and pain people here feel with the long, hard downturn in the O&G industry but this is a global situation that has little to do with politics but hard facts and science.

Alberta would do very poorly as a land locked country. The reality of that needs to be front and center because the stuff I read from the “victims” reflects an idea that Alberta the country would be paradise.

It’s not treasonous to advocate separation from the Canadian federation—it is heinous, though, for Alberta’s government to threaten it in order to preserve its moribund and beset polity.

One is not a traitor for advocating separation—but one is a hater, though, the way Canadian neo-right parties want their supporters to behave when challenged by politics, world dilbit market prices or rapid, CO2-induced climate change.

Climate change is not hypothetical—but it is hypocritical for Conservative cooperatives to incite heinous haters to blame the rest of Canada for their own denialist and separatist sentiments.

As for separatism: is it a viable option for a landlocked province—especially when the provocating issue is about moving resource through the jurisdictions it’s proposing to separate from? The most important element for Albertans to consider is that if the province wants to leave the federation, it may, but the rest of Canada (not sure if the ROC abbreviation is appropriate, here, given it was an Albertan-Reform coinage back when Quebec was the applicant and the “West-Wants-In”-ers chanted, “Good riddance!”) will get to have a say about it.

And especially a say about the diplomatic and economic relationship the remaining federation would have with its new, internally enclosed neighbour.

I entertained the question and came up with about sixty permutations or possible scenarios that included, naturally the American federation and potential separatist, landlocked states which might confederate (or something) with Alberta in order to purchase their own accesses to tidewater (possibly the Lakehead of Superior connected by binational seaways to the Atlantic), and other provinces which might join contiguously with Alberta to achieve the same or some other realization of their self-perceived potentials. In this process I realized that the Northwest Territories through which Alberta could access Arctic tidewater cannot entertain a co-separation proposal because it is not one of the provinces, they being sovereign, the only signatories to their respective confederations, and the only entities that may separate from the federation. Perhaps if this Territory confederated as a sovereign province first…?

Ironically, the most plausible co-separatist province would be British Columbia, chuck full of “treasonous traitors” as it is.

I concluded that Alberta separatism is barely viable and most unlikely.

But the real question is how viable is the moribund neo-right as it tightens its separatist bull’s arse.

With fly season upon us, it’s sure to tighten some more.

“ …As for separatism: is it a viable option for a landlocked province—especially when the provocating issue is about moving resource through the jurisdictions it’s proposing to separate from?… ” On that point, the separatists in Alberta have claimed that separation would in fact increase Alberta’s ability to push a pipeline across BC territory, allegedly because of some UN protocol that they claim gives small, landlocked countries right-of-way to ocean access, or “tidewater” to use the hackneyed terminology. I haven’t investigated this claim, simply because it seems implausible, but that’s what they say.

Of course, the kind of people that are strongly for Alberta separation are also the kind that buy into conspiracy theories about the UN & the “New World Order”, so I can’t see an appeal to the UN being a viable solution for them to take up anyway.

It seems to me treason is generally refereed at the national level, not at some sub national jurisdiction level. Therefore, if the national government does not do what some provincial or regional politician wants, it is not the national government being treasonous. If a provincial or regional politician threatens to separate from that nation because they do not get everything they want, it certainly isn’t the national government that is the one being treasonous.

There is a saying about history repeating itself instead as a farce, and I think this is what is happening with some not too bright conservatives now in the west, attempting to copying Quebec’s separatist tactics, because that worked so well economically for Quebec, didn’t it? Several decades of high deficits, high taxes, high unemployment and many head offices leaving Montreal for Toronto which has never threatened separatism. Does Calgary really want to go down the path Montreal did?

Of course Quebec’s bargaining power, however much it had, boiled down to two things, Alberta does not have – proximity to Ontario and it relative size. Also the debate in Quebec was mostly about provincial autonomy and powers within its own borders, not about trying to impose its way outside of its own boundaries. These distinctions are probably lost on the current proponents of western separatism who view it as a useful threat – sort of like little kids think when they tell their parents they are going to hold their breath until they get what they want (a pipeline across BC, a change of federal government, etc…). Most parents know how to deal with this sort of foolishness and I think the rest of Canada will react in much the same way.

Remoteness is Alberta’s (and Saskatchewan’s) distinction, obviously and primarily remoteness from tidewater. But the kind of remoteness the UCP avails is also the historiographical and mythological, the same kind that envisioned the Mormon ‘Promised Land’ of Deseret, or a homeland for Métis-‘Indian’ political alliance, or a haven from Russian persecution, or, indeed, a Canaan of the New World.

Remoteness is also the UCP’s conundrum and absurdity: it’s wanted to rally partisan supporters to the ‘everybody’s-out-to-get-us’ ilk to the circled wagon laager in the western prairie fastness, but at the same time it’s the thing Alberta wants ameliorated by transportation links to the outside world, if not by jurisdictional partnership like being part of a larger federation.

As any map of North America shows, Alberta has already ventured farther north from the 49th parallel than any other part of Canada, with networked transport-links, roads, rail and pipelines fanning out in every direction, excepting the north of which Alberta is the natural and infrastructural frontline when northern development eventually does happen. This Alberta-based network gives the impression of a place that doesn’t want to be alone.

In this sense Alberta is like Quebec—or perhaps any other place in Canada, excepting BC (owing to its tidewater proximity to California and East Asia, and original, perennial aloofness to Canada, some of the things Alberta covets )—where ardently demanded, outright Quebec independence cooled to “sovereignty association” when push came to shove: ‘separate’ from Canada except for all the stuff that makes federal partnership so advantageous: a larger national bank and stable, respected currency, an experienced standing armed force and long-cultivated, respected international diplomatic and economic relationships. Not even the gigantic, populous and venerable Habitant Homeland really wanted to be so alone, and settled for recognition of its cultural, historical distinctiveness in the end.

The chance of that recognition happening to Alberta is, shall we say, much more remote.

Scheer: ‘ I don’t believe he actually wants it built.’

Conservatives have gone down the Trump-style with more today from Scheer about Trudeau, on TMX.

EXCERPT: 

“I doubt his [Trudeau’s] sincerity because he hasn’t actually done anything. Show me the pipeline. He doesn’t support our energy sector … he failed to tell Canadians on what day construction would actually start,” Scheer said.

Ms. Smith’s claim the Alberta energy industry has “nearly” perfected zero-emissions natural gas sounds like magical thinking.

Yes carbon dioxide can be combined with other things to make synthetic fuel and materials, but that comes at a cost in more energy use. This is interesting in a laboratory setting but hardly commercially viable anytime soon. However, it does make for a “gee-whiz-oh wow” presentation.

More realistically, Ft. Mac could cook their tar using cheap BC hydro power from the new Peace River dam, but doing that is no free perpetual motion machine either. That junior high school physics is just so unpleasant.

One of the most significant examples of manipulation of the media occurred in the fall of 1990 when a group of PR firms in the US used the Kuwaiti ambassador’s daughter to relate a completely false story about Iraqi troops murdering Kuwaiti babies who were torn from incubators. The story of the Rendon Group, Hill and Knowlton, and other professional [email protected]#*ers deliberately misleading Americans in order to gain public acceptance for the Desert Storm show was eventually well-publicized, and one would think that anyone in the news media would be familiar with the scandal. But not Licia Corbella. In the lead-up to the 2003 illegal destruction of Iraq, Corbella reiterated the Kuwaiti preemie story as common knowledge of the wickedness of Saddam Hussein.
There is little evidence that Corbella is any worse than the other Kon-bots referred to in the article.
Some of them are creepier than they are stupid. This little bit about Cooper’s Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda pretty much sums up the role of the University of Calgary:“The invitation came from E. Burke Inlow, another American, and the first head of U of C’s political-science department. An expert on Iran and the Far East who died last year, Inlow himself had been recruited directly from an assignment with the Pentagon. There, according to his son, Brand, a Calgary lawyer, he was engaged in “cultural work—providing intelligence to people we (the U.S. government) were sending to the Middle East.””

Conservatives willing to ape Trump to win elections…

EXCERPT: Responding to Trudeau’s announcement on Tuesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer went so far as to suggest that Trudeau didn’t even really want the pipeline built — which comes close to suggesting the last few years in federal politics have been part of a very elaborate, and very expensive, ruse.

Trump-style i.e. ‘just make shit up’.

CPC and UCP have noticed Trump’s popularity with his base has not been hurt by just total BS.

If Alberta does separate, the pipeline will still belong to Canada. Do they propose to nationalize it, Venezuela-style?

It’s too soon to tell.


Justin Trudeau’s news conference on the same topic back in 2016 (Photo: Screenshot).

Alberta Conservatives and their legion of media cheerleaders obviously feared the first explanation was the truth, that Mr. Trudeau had somehow found the magic middle on this contentious issue and voters throughout the land would soon be flocking back to his side.

Why else would they be so cranky about an outcome that should have been easy for them to portray as a huge victory for their side?

Rather than celebrate, the Conservative commentariat spent the afternoon carping and moaning that Mr. Trudeau didn’t really mean it (a patently false narrative), that he didn’t go far enough and drop other legislation they don’t like (an argument you can make, I guess, but so what?), or that he didn’t look cheerful enough at his news conference in Ottawa.

The latter point is just pathetic. What was the prime minister supposed to do? Dance a jig? If he’d done that, these nabobs of negativity would have complained he was nothing but a flaky drama teacher!

The general tone was set by the Calgary Herald’s Don Braid, who had the cheek to publish his attack on the prime minister for doing what the columnist had demanded before the decision had even been announced. “Ottawa won’t deserve Alberta’s thanks for pipeline OK,” barked the headline, neatly summarizing this province’s inevitably ungracious reaction to anything Mr. Trudeau does.


Green Party of Canada Leader Elizabeth May (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But the idea yesterday’s decision was a strategic masterstroke by the Liberals, long faces and all, is based on the assumption there is a middle left in Canada, and that we’re not becoming as polarized as Donald Trump’s America thanks to the efforts of those now-worried conservative bloviators.

It certainly assumes that no one is paying any attention any more to what Mr. Trudeau said the last time his cabinet approved the TMX, back on Nov. 29, 2016 – to wit, that “we could not have approved this project without the leadership of Premier (Rachel) Notley and Alberta’s climate leadership plan.”

“We said that major pipelines could only get built if we had a price on carbon and strong environmental protection in place,” Mr. Trudeau said then. His assembled cabinet ministers that day, then including Jody Wilson-Reybould, didn’t look all that cheerful either, whatever that meant.

For those who do remember such things, this would suggest that Liberal talk is as cheap as gasoline in Edmonton after Premier Jason Kenney tore up the NDP’s carbon levy.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

And there are plenty of people in parts of Canada that, unlike Alberta and Saskatchewan, are inclined to vote Liberal in a pinch, who now likely won’t.

They won’t vote for Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives either, of course. But this does suggest that if Jagmeet Singh and the NDP can’t come up soon with a compelling pitch, a lot of them are going to vote for Elizabeth May’s Green Party of Canada, perhaps providing it with the breakthrough Ms. May keeps predicting.

Well, like I say, it’s too soon to tell. I’ve been wrong about this stuff before, but you’d have to put me in the group that wonders if Mr. Trudeau has just blown it all to smithereens.

Two things are guaranteed, though:Building a bigger pipeline to “new markets” via the West Coast will never raise the price of Alberta bitumen as long as the law of supply and demand remains in effect.
Shipping more bitumen from Alberta’s tarsands through a bigger pipe to whatever markets will buy it will not lower Canada’s carbon emissions.

St. Albert MP threatens to sue former classmates over allegations

The CBC reported yesterday that Conservative Michael Cooper was threatening to sue two of his former law school classmates for publicly alleging the St. Albert-Edmonton MP once made disparaging comments about immigrants from places insufficiently steeped in Judeo-Christian values.


St. Albert-Edmonton Conservative MP Michael Cooper (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But first the CBC reported the two other lawyers’ allegations at length, a story you can read for yourselves here. The lawyers quoted by the CBC said they decided to go public after reading of Mr. Cooper’s behaviour before the House of Commons Justice Committee on May 28.

Mr. Cooper told the CBC he recalled the class discussion 11 years ago, but denied making the comments. “I have instructed my counsel to take all necessary legal measures,” he warned.

Politically alert residents of Mr. Cooper’s riding are advised to keep an eye on how the threatened legal action unfolds. Threatening to sue for defamation can be a tricky strategy for politicians, as Justin Trudeau discovered recently when he said he planned to sue Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for comments he made during the days of the SNC-Lavalin brouhaha was bedeviling the prime minister.

Mr. Scheer, of course, was the understanding boss who gently tapped Mr. Cooper on the wrist in late May for his offensive performance before the Justice Committee, in which he read into the record the anti-Muslim screed of the terrorist who murdered 51 people in March as they prayed in their mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Meanwhile, in New Zealand yesterday, a judge sentenced a Christchurch white supremacist to 21 months in prison for sharing a banned video of the terrorist attack. New Zealand has also banned publication the terrorist’s rambling manifesto, the one Mr. Cooper read to the committee","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

There’s a nice summary of pipeline myths on The Tyee.
As usual, Alberta politicians take billions of dollars of Canadian taxpayer’s money with all the grace of Veruca Salt receiving another pony from her father.
There might be an uptick in crude prices once the fracking boom goes bust in the US, but if flyover country ends up under water for 9 months of the year due to a brand new, climate change induced monsoon season, maybe there will be no place to sell the gasoline.

Sometimes I wonder if all this nonsense is but a dream. The plot is worse than a soap opera’s. But then I look at Cooper’s photo with its depiction of an ostrich head firmly extended on a long neck of dorkiness, poised at the ready to plunge at any instant into a handy pile of sand, recall his voice, and realize, not even my dreams invent creatures like that.

I always find it interesting that politicians and voters who advocate for ‘individual responsibility’ take on but one choice when it comes to having to pay for their own contributions to CO2 emissions: Deny that such pollution is affecting climate in any (significant) way. With the re-awakening of naked neoliberalism in the right wing party across our nation, the only option for my grandchildrens’ future is indeed bleak at best. My apologies to them and all the kids who get to inherit our woeful regress.

There certainly is some polarization on the issue of pipelines, making it tricky for the Federal Liberals to try to occupy the middle ground. However, this is what throughout history they have done on many polarizing issues and often fairly successfully.

Yes there are some very vocal climate change denier or ignorers on one side and some strong supporters of Greenpeace on the other side too. Neither are really much inclined to support the Liberals anyways, nor are they inclined to moderate their views preferring the comfort of their own echo chambers. Therefore the Liberals have little choice but to hope those in the middle are sufficient to support them.

I think little infuriates those opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline as much as noting the opposition is a mix of nimbyism as much as environmentalism. Fortunately for the Federal Liberals the pipeline is not in Ontario or Quebec. They might take a hit in parts of BC, but the strongest opposition is somewhat localized. They are probably willing to concede most of Vancouver Island to the Greens anyways and it seems they can not ever be pro oil enough to satisfy very many in Alberta.

If environmental feelings were so strong in central Canada, there would be a tanker ban off the east coast too by now. Its not 100% certain the Liberal strategy will work, but I think it has a good chance of political success.

The risk here is that the anti-pipeline vote and pro-climate-action vote will splinter, with those votes being distributed amongst three parties—the Liberals, the NDP, and the Greens—while the pro-pipeline and pro-climate-inaction vote will consolidate behind the ScheerCons, leading through the vicissitudes of our single-member plurality (aka FPTP) voting system to a Conservative victory in October.

The only hope is that we end up with a hung Parliament after all the ballots are counted, and even then that the Greens & NDP hold their noses and support the Liberals and their watered-wine climate action strategy over the Cons and their keep-the-coal-fires-burning strategy. Both of the major poll aggregators, Eric Grenier & P J Fournier, have posted seat count projections for the Cons that straddle the line between minority & majority—mathematically 169 seats, although if we then deduct one for a Speaker, it really needs to be 170—so such an outcome remains statistically plausible.

144,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"With Stephen Mandel’s resignation and zero Legislature seats, Alberta Party faces leadership vacuum and bleak future",2019-06-29 00:46:00,David Climenhaga,,"So long, Stephen Mandel, at least we can’t say we hardly knew ye!

Mr. Mandel announced in a news release yesterday he would step down on June 30 as leader of the Alberta Party – which he took over after an internal coup last year and turned from a vehicle for disaffected Alberta Liberals into a vehicle for disaffected Progressive Conservatives.


Former Alberta Party leader Greg Clark (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As it turned out, the timing was all wrong: a polarized electorate, a province-wide majority of Conservatives determined not to endure another four years of NDP rule, and a left-leaning Capital Region just as determined not to split the progressive vote to the United Conservative Party’s further advantage would probably have doomed the Alberta Party no matter who its leader was.

With slightly different circumstances, though, things could have turned out very differently for the former Edmonton city councillor, three-term mayor, PC health minister, and MLA. Love it or hate it, Edmonton’s lavish $600-million-plus downtown hockey arena project – owned by billionaire Daryl Katz and substantially paid for by Edmonton taxpayers – will now be Mr. Mandel’s best-known political legacy.

The Alberta Party gambit was Mr. Mandel’s second comeback bid after he retired from Edmonton civic politics in October 2013. It was marginally less successful than the first, in 2014, when PC premier Jim Prentice appointed him unelected to the health portfolio and he subsequently won a by-election in Edmonton-Whitemud that fall, serving as MLA for five and a half months until the PCs were swept away by the NDP in May 2015.


The late Jim Prentice with Mr. Mandel soon after the PC premier put him unelected into his cabinet (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Nevertheless, in the end, Mr. Mandel’s undeniable talents as a political pro and fund-raiser didn’t amount to the proverbial hill o’ beans for the Alberta Party. It had three MLAs going into the April 16 election, albeit two of them floor crossers, and zero after the polls closed on election night.

This prompted some sniping on social media yesterday, but in fairness, Mr. Mandel did something no one else could, briefly getting the Alberta Party onto the radar with the province’s voters, raising the party’s provincial share of the vote from 2.2 per cent in 2015 to 9.1 per cent. Despite his fund-raising talents, though, the party is in financial disarray.

From the perspective of the present, blessed as we are with 20/20 hindsight, it looks very much as if the Alberta Party would have been better off if it had stuck with its previous leader, capable former Calgary-Elbow MLA Greg Clark, who was pushed aside by Mr. Mandel’s backers despite having a credible chance of re-election if he’d remained leader. Leastways, no one can claim the party would have done even worse with Mr. Clark at the helm.

So yesterday’s development sees Mr. Mandel return to a fretful retirement and the Alberta Party facing a bleak future with its supporters unsure if they’re supposed to be Red Tories or fiscally conservative Liberals, or if they have enough money to serve either constituency.


Former NDP Health Minister Sarah Hoffman, an alumna of Concordia University of Edmonton (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

You could argue the Red Tory-Blue Grit thing is a recipe for a big-tent small-c conservative party like the now-defunct PCs, but recent developments suggest that in a fiscally, socially, and even regionally polarized province, it’s actually more like a formula for permanent failure.

The search is now on for an interim Alberta Party leader. There will be a proper leadership race eventually, which will generate a few headlines, so the ennui will continue a little longer. After that, I predict, pfffft.

As for Mr. Mandel, if his wife can’t stand having him around the house, there’s always the municipal election in October 2021. The Senate “election” on the same date is out, unfortunately, since Mr. Mandel will be 76 by then and Senators must retire at 75.

In the mean time, the Windsor, Ont., native who received much of his university education in the United States will have to satisfy himself in the ceremonial role of chancellor of Edmonton’s tiny Concordia University, a former Lutheran college founded in 1921 that today has fewer than 2,000 students.

It’s hard to believe he will find that very engaging or will be able to resist the temptation to make a nuisance of himself.

Edmonton-Glenora NDP MLA Sarah Hoffman, another former health minister, is an alumna of that institution.

Ontario Court of Appeal upholds federal carbon tax; Alberta proclaims law breaking public sector contracts

Also yesterday in Alberta politics…
The Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the federal Government’s right to impose a carbon tax, rejecting arguments made by the government of Conservative Premier Doug Ford. In a similar case last month, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal made a similar decision. This preponderance of legal opinion, however, is unlikely to stop Alberta from pursuing a similarly doomed challenge because the coordinated effort by Conservative provincial governments is a way to use provincial tax dollars to campaign politically against the Liberal federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The legal effectiveness of such arguments is increasingly obvious, as is the unethical nature of using of tax funds this way. The jury remains out on its political effectiveness.
Bill 9, the unconstitutional legislation by Premier Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party Government delaying collective bargaining and arbitration for tens of thousands of public employees until the end of October, received Royal Assent and was proclaimed into law. The delay specifically breaks provisions in several public sector unions’ current collective agreements. Background on the motivation and strategy behind the Public Sector Arbitration Deferral Act is found here.
Remember when Mr. Kenney accused the NDP of lying about the state of the province’s books, claiming the province’s finances were a worse mess than the former government had said? Turns out that what the NDP significantly underestimated was the amount of progress they’d made reducing the deficit. The latest government statistics show the deficit was more than $2 billion smaller than last year’s forecast by the NDP. Not a lie; just caution. The UCP has no shame, though, so they continued to complain about NDP overspending and offered no apologies or acknowledgements for Mr. Kenney’s disingenuous rhetoric","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_30877"" style=""width: 278px;""><img width=""268"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-30877"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-30877"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Clark-268x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Clark-268x300.jpg 268w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Clark.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-30877"">Former Alberta Party leader Greg Clark (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">As it turned out, the timing was all wrong: a polarized electorate, a province-wide majority of Conservatives determined not to endure another four years of NDP rule, and a left-leaning Capital Region just as determined not to split the progressive vote to the United Conservative Party’s further advantage would probably have doomed the Alberta Party no matter who its leader was.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With slightly different circumstances, though, things could have turned out very differently for the former Edmonton city councillor, three-term mayor, PC health minister, and MLA. Love it or hate it, Edmonton’s lavish $600-million-plus downtown hockey arena project – owned by billionaire Daryl Katz and substantially paid for by Edmonton taxpayers – will now be Mr. Mandel’s best-known political legacy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Alberta Party gambit was <a href=""http://daveberta.ca/2019/06/stephen-mandel-alberta-party/"">Mr. Mandel’s second comeback bid</a> after he retired from Edmonton civic politics in October 2013. It was marginally less successful than the first, in 2014, when PC premier Jim Prentice appointed him unelected to the health portfolio and he subsequently won a by-election in Edmonton-Whitemud that fall, serving as MLA for five and a half months until the PCs were swept away by the NDP in May 2015.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" id=""attachment_30878"" style=""width: 391px;""><img width=""381"" height=""354"" class="" wp-image-30878"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-30878"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/JP-SM-300x279.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/JP-SM-300x279.jpg 300w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/JP-SM.jpg 800w"" sizes=""(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-30878"">The late Jim Prentice with Mr. Mandel soon after the PC premier put him unelected into his cabinet (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Nevertheless, in the end, Mr. Mandel’s undeniable talents as a political pro and fund-raiser didn’t amount to the proverbial hill o’ beans for the Alberta Party. It had three MLAs going into the April 16 election, albeit two of them floor crossers, and zero after the polls closed on election night.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This prompted some sniping on social media yesterday, but in fairness, Mr. Mandel did something no one else could, briefly getting the Alberta Party onto the radar with the province’s voters, raising the party’s provincial share of the vote from 2.2 per cent in 2015 to 9.1 per cent. Despite his fund-raising talents, though, the party is in financial disarray.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the perspective of the present, blessed as we are with 20/20 hindsight, it looks very much as if the Alberta Party would have been better off if it had stuck with its previous leader, capable former Calgary-Elbow MLA Greg Clark, who was pushed aside by Mr. Mandel’s backers despite having a credible chance of re-election if he’d remained leader. Leastways, no one can claim the party would have done even worse with Mr. Clark at the helm.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So yesterday’s development sees Mr. Mandel return to a fretful retirement and the Alberta Party facing a bleak future with its supporters unsure if they’re supposed to be Red Tories or fiscally conservative Liberals, or if they have enough money to serve either constituency.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignleft"" id=""attachment_30876"" style=""width: 265px;""><img width=""255"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-30876"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-30876"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Hoffman-4-255x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Hoffman-4-255x300.jpg 255w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Hoffman-4.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-30876"">Former NDP Health Minister Sarah Hoffman, an alumna of Concordia University of Edmonton (Photo: David J.

<p class=""p1"">You could argue the Red Tory-Blue Grit thing is a recipe for a big-tent small-c conservative party like the now-defunct PCs, but recent developments suggest that in a fiscally, socially, and even regionally polarized province, it’s actually more like a formula for permanent failure.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The search is now on for an interim Alberta Party leader. There will be a proper leadership race eventually, which will generate a few headlines, so the ennui will continue a little longer. After that, I predict, <em>pfffft.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">As for Mr. Mandel, if his wife can’t stand having him around the house, there’s always the municipal election in October 2021. The Senate “election” on the same date is out, unfortunately, since Mr. Mandel will be 76 by then and Senators must retire at 75.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the mean time, the Windsor, Ont., native who received much of his university education in the United States will have to satisfy himself in the ceremonial role of chancellor of Edmonton’s tiny Concordia University, a former Lutheran college founded in 1921 that today has fewer than 2,000 students.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s hard to believe he will find that very engaging or will be able to resist the temptation to make a nuisance of himself.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Edmonton-Glenora NDP MLA Sarah Hoffman, another former health minister, is an alumna of that institution.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Ontario Court of Appeal upholds federal carbon tax; Alberta proclaims law breaking public sector contracts</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Also yesterday in Alberta politics…</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">The Court of Appeal for Ontario <a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/5438730/carbon-tax-trudeau-provincial-courts/"">upheld the federal Government’s right to impose a carbon tax</a>, rejecting arguments made by the government of Conservative Premier Doug Ford. In a similar case last month, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal made a similar decision. This preponderance of legal opinion, however, is unlikely to stop Alberta from pursuing a similarly doomed challenge because the coordinated effort by Conservative provincial governments is a way to use provincial tax dollars to campaign politically against the Liberal federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The legal effectiveness of such arguments is increasingly obvious, as is the unethical nature of using of tax funds this way. The jury remains out on its political effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">Bill 9, the unconstitutional legislation by Premier Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party Government delaying collective bargaining and arbitration for tens of thousands of public employees until the end of October, received Royal Assent and was proclaimed into law. The delay specifically breaks provisions in several public sector unions’ current collective agreements. Background on the motivation and strategy behind the&nbsp;<em>Public Sector Arbitration Deferral Act</em> is <a href=""https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/06/the-strategy-behind-the-ucps-public-sector-arbitration-deferral-act-explained/"">found here</a>.</li>
<li>Remember when Mr. Kenney accused the NDP of lying about the state of the province’s books, claiming the province’s finances were a worse mess than the former government had said? Turns out that what the NDP significantly underestimated was the amount of progress they’d made <em>reducing</em> the deficit. The <a href=""https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/latest-alberta-fiscal-update-shows-6-7-billion-deficit-for-2018-19"">latest government statistics</a> show the deficit was more than $2 billion <em>smaller</em> than last year’s forecast by the NDP. Not a lie; just caution. The UCP has no shame, though, so they continued to complain about NDP overspending and offered no apologies or acknowledgements for Mr. Kenney’s disingenuous rhetoric.</li>

Good riddance.

Oh, and thank you for stealing votes that would otherwise have gone to the NDP. If we have a Kenney party in AB, you can thank all the fringe parties that helped split the vote thereby helping the pee pee party.

I liked Mandel, but from day 1 I thought he was not the right leader for the Alberta Party. If they stuck with Clark, they might have at least held on to the one seat they had, or maybe not. They actually did fairly well in the last election, doubling their vote percentage to around 10%, which has in some recent provincial elections resulted in parties getting 4 or 5 MLA’s, but unfortunately for Mandel and his party not this time. This last election, most Albertans decided to go left or right, leaving very little room for a party in the middle.

I have to wonder what the future holds for the Alberta Party. The respectable vote percentage they got indicates their might be some hope, particularly if some UCP supporters become disenchanted with Kenney if he does not live up to his promises or hype. However, being shut out of the legislature is a difficult hurdle to overcome and I think the Alberta Party might struggle to attract someone of a high caliber to take over now that Mr. Mandel is going. It might be that 10% was a high water mark for a party that has such a great name, but has struggled to get support and be taken seriously.

It might have been better if Mr. Mandel stayed on a bit longer to help build or rebuild the party. There is sure no rush to choose a new leader as the next election will not be for several years. However, I suspect Mr. Mandel’s interest and enthusiasm has waned considerably since the election result and retirement probably looks much better to him than hard political slogging, which he would not get the benefit from or much credit for anyways.

@Dave: They didn’t double their vote percentage … they more than quadrupled it—from 2.2% in 2015, to 9.1% in May 2019 (source: Elections Alberta Official Results page). But their vote was highly inefficient, and they failed to elect a single MLA. In hindsight, they would probably have done better had they adopted the federal Green Party’s tactic of focusing all of their efforts on a few key ridings where they had a decent chance of winning, instead of the implausible charade that they were gunning for government.

But they still did far better than the moribund Alberta Liberals …

Consider the dissimilar cases of Meng Wanzhou and Stephanie Clifford.


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s brief side conversation with President Xi on the same occasion (Photo: Screenshot of CBC video).

The first we won’t allow to leave Canada, the second we won’t allow to visit. Both, obviously, because that’s what the giant boy-man who is president of the United States desires.

Or, more to the point, it’s what the Trudeau Government thinks Mr. Trump wants because we’re now at the point we try to anticipate his every likely whim in advance, the better to preserve the USMCA, the NAFTA, or whatever our corporate-rights agreement with the United States is called this week.

This is just pathetic, and it’s certainly not what Justin’s old man would have done in the same situation – or even the more diplomatic Lester B. Pearson, who preceded Pierre Trudeau in the job of prime minister of Canada, and who President Lyndon B. Johnson famously accused of pissing on America’s rug by not toadying up to U.S. warmongering in Vietnam.


Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou (Photo: Office of the President of Russia).

Ms. Meng, of course, is the executive for Chinese electronics giant and alleged security threat Huawei who we’ve been obediently holding captive since late last year because the Trump Administration wants to use her as a bargaining chip in its ongoing trade war with China.

Oh no, it’s all about the rule of law, our treaties with the United States, and the fact Huawei was selling electronic widgets to Iran, you say? Please! The previous paragraph is an accurate summary of the explanation given by President Trump himself of the U.S. demand we extradite Ms. Meng to a kangaroo trial and a predetermined prison sentence, followed by, perhaps, repatriation in the event the Chinese fully knuckle under to the art of the deal.

You can believe that pious posh-posh about treaty obligations if you like, but you have to agree that Ms. Meng’s lawyers were onto something when they wrote Justice Minister David Lametti on Monday arguing the case against her is “palpably” political.

They asserted, therefore, that Ottawa should let her go, and this would be true to “Canadian values, including the rule of law, even in circumstances where this has meant a departure from American foreign policy.” They gave the example of Canada’s refusal to participate in the tragic and immoral Iraq war, although they could as easily given the example of the tragic and immoral Vietnam war that got Mr. Pearson called on the carpet by LBJ.


Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels (Photo: Glenn Francis, Creative Commons).

This is what the elder Mr. Trudeau would have done, I’d hazard, and it’s embarrassing the Trudeau we have now won’t do the same.

Ms. Clifford, of course, is better known as Stormy Daniels, the American star of movies of questionable artistic merit and sometime presidential paramour. Her relationship with Mr. Trump seems lately to have been, well, stormy.

Ms. Clifford was denied entry to Canada a week ago Friday for “mysterious” reasons, according to the few news organizations that bothered to cover the story, several of them Russian. Those that did mostly used it as an excuse to run salacious photos of Ms. Clifford and engage in a little free advertising for the tacky Niagara Falls strip joint that invited her to the Canadian side of the falls for what has been termed a meet-and-greet last weekend. The proprietor of the establishment complains he paid for the trip and is now, in a manner appropriate to that geographical location, over a barrel.

Since Ms. Clifford has no criminal convictions, it’s hard to imagine what the legal justification for the decision could have been. Perhaps Canada Border Services Agency officials worried she would corrupt our morals – she’s been known to hang around with Mr. Trump, after all. Or maybe she just forgot her passport.


Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1957 (Photo: Nobel Foundation, Public Domain).

It seems more likely, though, this was just another tawdry example of our government shouting “how high” even before Mr. Trump’s minions yelled “jump!” Despite their differences, these two situations are just different sides of the same coin.

Together, they illustrate a troubling pattern, even though it’s doubtful trying to anticipate Mr. Trump’s wishes ever gets one very far – at least if the one in question happens to be the government of a country that ought to be able to consider itself an ally of the United States.

Just in case you’re wondering, obsequious as we’ve become, we’re certainly better off with Mr. Trudeau’s snivelling than we would have been with Andrew Scheer at the helm and Conservatives in power.

I mention this because Mr. Scheer was pretending last week in Internet memes cooked up by the former Rebel Media operatives who staff his strategic brain trust to be way more manly than Mr. Trudeau when it comes to standing up to China.


U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 (Photo: Arnold Newman, Public Domain).

He’s been doing this to cow-tow, as it were, to Western Canadian beef farmers and slaughterhouse operators, all of whom presumably are going to vote for his party anyway, over the way China’s cut off beef imports from Canada to apply pressure on us to release Ms. Meng.

No one can say that these export-dependent farmers’ fears aren’t real enough, but Mr. Scheer’s posturing is a bit of a laugh considering that his generation of Conservatives would already have shipped Ms. Meng off to a drumhead court at an undisclosed location in the Republic, no doubt without even the legal niceties of an extradition hearing. So would they have embroiled us in the Iraq and Vietnam wars if Conservatives of those times can be taken at their word.

For their part, the Chinese are in a position to squeeze Canadian famers till their pips squeak to make a point, confident that the Conservatives’ favourite American, Mr. Trump, will do nothing at all to thank Canada for its loyalty, except perhaps to impose some additional tariffs of his own on us.

Indeed, from the Chinese government’s perspective, kicking the crap out of Canada is an excellent way to make a strong point to Mr. Trump, confident there will be no repercussions from the United States, which is basically in the process of blowing up the world trade order it put in place to serve itself anyway.

Evidence coming out of the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, on Saturday suggests this may have worked for Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump. Leastways, their side chat produced some headlines favourable to both, unlike Mr. Trudeau’s brief side conversation with President Xi about Canadian agricultural products and the Canadians languishing in Chinese jails, presumably as hostages to be exchanged for Ms. Meng.

Naturally there was no mention of Canada, let alone thanks, from President Trump.

Catering to tRump by messing with Stormy … fine by me.
tRump is an existential threat to our existence so bending the rules on that one just makes good sense.

But Meng? Besides being plain wrong (its is simply part of the economic & judicial warfare against China and Iran), the Meng arrest was about the dumbest thing Canada has done.

Ms Meng should have quietly been advised to leave Canada, and Canada’s response to tRump should have been an trite apology with a very wide, shit-eating smirk—oops, lost in translation! So sorry! But, when the good times are all gone, we’ll look for her if she ever passes this way…”…Seven seas that run high…”…heh, heh,…

Meng’s arrest was probably worth the attempt to garner favour with tRump, but JT found out nothing more about the brat than the fact he has no qualms about doing more of the more he always does.

So now JT knows. Now he coughs in the Orange One’s presence. Mark these words: JT is going to poke a stick at tRump, as he did with the cough—an offence for which the presidunce had his own staffer kicked out of the Oval Office—and then again in a highly publicized tête-à-tête with tRump’s Democratic nemesis House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, neither of which provoked comment from the Twitter Twit but which doubtlessly piqued his famously thin skin, more sensitively irritable than a fish’s in a tank of diluted amphetamine. JT’s gonna keep poking, coughing, irritating and crushing tRump’s famously small hands at every occasion a handshake can be squashed in. He has a plan.

Maybe tRump’s innate sense of which of his acquaintances’ buttons are most irritating to push will advise him to pretend he doesn’t even notice JT’s increasing sauciness simply because that’s what Canadians are always indignant about: Americans not noticing us. The ploy works either way for JT, though, especially if Canadians perceive that tRump’s feigned indifference is in reaction to, not in control of, the relationship with his nation’s northern neighbour and most important cultural, strategic and economic ally.

Yes, of course we’ve been lamenting that JT is no PET. Yet, the fortuitous congruity between Canada’s and America’s electoral cycles (both are beginning their respective federal election campaigns even though the Americans’ is a year longer) affords JT the opportunity to handcuff his domestic Conservative rival and rally patriots to his own party. And, if he does it with a cough and a smirk, he’d be only one step away from the perfect PET pirouette.

Just like Stormy Daniels’ affair with the married tRump—with respect showing Americans the ethical caliber of their presidunce with all the reality TV grit he deserves—we always knew any favours tRump does Canada would be by way of perversity. In our case it’s also ironic because any attempt tRump makes to slag our PM will immediately have the opposite effect in Canada (as it did when The Donald insulted JT by publicly calling him “weak” and “dishonest” behind his back and suggesting it was going to cost Canadians “a lot of money”)—which is why JT will provoke it if tRump doesn’t try to insert himself into the Canadian election all by himself.

But, even better, it can only help the Liberals if Scheer starts reading verbatim from the tRump playbook instead of in paraphrase as he’s been trying to do so far (this, of course, to feed his base the red meat they’ve become increasingly addicted to). Although JT probably doesn’t expect Scheer to recommend tRumpian policies to Canadians, the PM can reasonably expect to punch Scheer into the corner of the ring with rhetorical questions about his climate and immigration policies, underscoring the parallels with tRump’s odious policies south of the border which, handily, will be getting close inspection the whole while in the American context we Canadians love to observe and comment about.

And, of course, JT gets to look more like his father, flipping the bird to Alberta still as politically affordable now, when Liberal prospects there are still very poor, as it was in PET’s NEP days.

tRump: the gift that keeps on giving—we just had to get used to him.

I would flout Trump on Stormy and would go along with the US on Meng.

We can’t control other countries rules, but we can decide who comes to our country. I have always believed we should let most everyone in unless their is a very good reason not too. I think Stormy’s biggest supposed crime was embarassing Trump by exposing his moral shortcomings.

Meng on the ofher hand is alleged to have committed a serious offence under US law. It may or not be the case, the courts can decide. While we in Canada may not regard the alleged offense as seriously as the US does, it is a general law there that applies to everyone, not jusr Meng. I don’t like the rule of law,argument much, as I thimk extradition is properly decided on a case by case basis, but I think in this case it is reasonable to let it play out under the law.

She is certainly not being badly treated here, although limited to her large Vancouver mansion, so the Chinese response is disproportionate. If anything it shows the hypocricies of the Chinese system to the world. First, because they do not have fair trials there, they find it hard to believe she would get a fair trial in Canada or the US. Second, being a member of the economic and political elite, the Chinese government seems wiiling to go to great lenghts to help her. If she was an average Chinese citizen, I doubt their government would have tried to pressure us so much. Communism is China is now a sham now and in name only. The government protects its elites and priviledged as much as or more so as does the US. Both systems are fundamentally rotten and unfortunatetly we have to try and navigate around their shortcomings these days as best as possible.

One way or another, our Canada always seems to end up on every list of the world’s Top Ten economies.

Granted, we are almost inevitably No. 10 of 10, which may leave the intensely competitive dissatisfied. But, realistically, this also means we’re No. 10 of 193, if you go by the membership of the United Nations, which is a moving target in a perpetually unhappy and fractious world.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Now, a large economy is no guarantee of national happiness, and money, as my mama used to say, isn’t everything. Still, in this world it is a measure of success, and, managed properly, of potential. Being a citizen of a rich country, therefore, isn’t a bad place to be, which is why so many people dream of coming here.

As a country, it gives us the financial, technical and educational resilience to successfully meet an economic, political or environmental crisis – leastways, if we have the collective wisdom to recognize such crises as they come along.

It’s interesting that we Canadians tend to see our country as smaller and less influential than it really is – doubtless the result of living next door to a cacophonous colossus.


Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andrew Scheer, Flickr).

And though our history turns out to be darker than many of us imagined, certainly that generation, mine, that went to public school in the 1950s and 1960s, we still have not done badly in the great scheme of things – struggling to set things right over time and all without a bloody revolution or a civil war.

If you’re looking for a universal lesson in Canada, then, it’s that those who say governments never do anything right are full of baloney.

Governments can – and, indeed, must – pick winners and losers, and the Imperial Government in London picked a winner in 1867 when it pushed the disparate parts of still-British North America for geo-strategic and budgetary reasons into a national union that was not entirely comfortable at the time. Canada.


NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

This was achieved despite political uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic, with John A. Macdonald – “the ablest politician in Upper Canada,” said Lord Carnarvon – working hand in glove with the Colonial Office.

Canada doubtless benefitted from London’s perceived needs to save money on defence and to get things done in a hurry, before our next-door neighbour turned its attention northward in the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War. (It certainly took us a long time to clean up the details after the basics were laid out in the British North America Act, and then thanks to Pierre Trudeau.)


The late NDP Opposition leader Jack Layton (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The history of northern migration by those loyal to the British Crown who fled the depredations of the American Revolution likely also gentled the worst ethnocentric instincts of colonialism that later created such catastrophes in post-colonial Asia and Africa.

Yet it is more than a lucky accident that our country grew up to be the place it is.

Canada must be seen as a genuine triumph of bureaucracy, a successful creation of a professional civil service, that prospers still.

Further meditations on the national holiday, which marks the start of Campaign 2019

Canada Day 2019 marks the beginning of the official campaign period leading up to this fall’s federal election, and the rhetoric, excitement, and limitations on spending and donations that go with that season.


Former Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien (Photo: Michael Ignatieff, Flickr).

If there is a lesson to be drawn from this fact, it is that grafting American innovations like fixed election dates onto our Westminster Parliamentary system is usually a bad idea, especially from the governing party’s point of view.

The three major national parties that have been in a position to form government in recent years all suffer from vacuous leadership that is both weak and flawed. A Jean Chrétien, a Brian Mulroney, or a Jack Layton could be expected to win at a canter.


Former Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney (Photo: Miller Center, Flickr).

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faltered badly in recent months, which should have made it easy for an Opposition party leader to make a compelling case for change. But Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s pitch is for more Harperism with its roughest edges lightly burnished.

Canadians have been there, seen that done and would really prefer not to have it happen again. This makes the Conservative base furious, and therefore furiously accident-prone. Perhaps Mr. Scheer will put out a meme claiming that if he were PM, he’d make Canada’s GDP No. 8! One wonders how many Conservatives are seriously contemplating voting for Maxime Bernier and his batty far-right People’s Party just to overcome the nagging sensation of Scheer indifference?

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is as yet unclear about what he stands for, if anything. This leaves NDP supporters dispirited, awash with ennui, and casting lingering, longing glances at Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, whose party lacks an infrastructure that can form a national government.


Green Party Leader Elizabeth May (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

This, in turn, makes many New Democrats, appalled at the prospect of a return to Conservative Government, vulnerable to the attractions of strategic voting, Mr. Trudeau’s obvious limitations notwithstanding.

Here in Alberta, meanwhile, the avatars of our fake national unity crisis – presumably ginned up to frighten Canadian voters into holding their noses and betting on the dubious attractions of Mr. Scheer – are scruffy men in ancient rust-holed and bumper-stickered pickups who want us to believe we can all be as rich as Croesus if only we’ll take their financial advice. Two months ago they were telling us that sustainable energy was a UN plot to land-lock Alberta’s resources. Now they say the UN will guarantee an independent Alberta’s bitumen access to tidewater!

This may not make much difference to the solid Conservative vote within Alberta’s borders, but somehow I don’t think these people constitute much of a threat to Confederation whether or not Mr. Trudeau and his Liberals manage to get re-elected.

Perhaps this explains why Stephen Harper himself seems to have turned his attention away from reforming Canada in his sinister image to another project, helping England finally stage its Brexit gong show, not just extracting itself from a united Europe but probably unintentionally from the United Kingdom in the process","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

I always liked the opening line of Anna karenina, the great Leo Tolstoy epic on love and lust. “All happy families are alike: each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”

In a similar vein: “All happy countries are alike: each unhappy country is unhappy in its own way.”

This Canada Day we can celebrate the triumph of our accomplishments like equality and universal access to health care which is the core foundation for any society, but goddammit we pay too much for wifi and beer.

David you have certainly made my day referring to our 3 major party leaders as “vacuous”, personally I would exclude Andrew Scheer and include Elizabeth May but that simply comes down to ideology. As for Justin Trudeau, I remember saying many times before Alberta’s last election that Alberta could survive another 4 years of Rachel Notley but we can’t survive another 4 of Justin Trudeau! And just for the record David I try to keep my goatee well trimmed and I don’t have a single bumper sticker on any of my vehicles but I would vote for a separate western Canada in a heartbeat!

Hello Farmer Brian

You may keep your beard tidy and your truck free of bumper stickers, but that makes you a credit to your ideology. It goes not give your ideology credit.
There are two ‘separate’ ideas here. David is talking about the Alberta independence movement. You are advocating for a separate Western Canada. In the Western Canada version, Alberta and BC should be on the same side. How do you square that given the current relationship between these provinces? And, the Western Canada concept will generally have more support here if we are on bad terms with the people in Ontario, but they just elected a fantastic premier, if one judges by conservative ideology. Are you pro-Ford or anti-Ford?
But your comment resonated with me because I have been thinking recently about the futility of debate. You post regularly on this site, but your arguments are not persuasive ( ie: Andrew Scheer *is* a stuffed shirt ), and you are certainly not persuaded by what you read here. And, on Canada Day, you declare you long for Canada’s dismemberment. The plan you promote is pretty unrealistic; is *anything – anything at all* better than having to work with people living all across the continent? You post here, knowing, I think, that it will make no difference. You want to not have to ever talk with folks east of Manitoba, presumably because it’s pointless to try. Lately I have begun to feel the same way, from the other side of that ideological wall. Why even look for compromise where there is no mutual understanding, no common ground?
Maybe I’m just getting old. Well, enjoy your day, too.

Doug, how many years have western politicians attempted to influence more positive outcomes from Ottawa. Peter Lougheed battled with Ottawa, Ralph Klien the same. It is all very simple math, the federal government receives roughly $20 billion more in revenue from Alberta than it sends back in programming. As such you would think that the federal government would want Alberta to have continued success but we only have roughly 10% of the seats in the House of Commons so we have very little clout. You can easily win a majority government without a single seat in Alberta. Doug I am 55 years old, born and raised Albertan, I have watched this my whole life and it certainly gets worse when there is a Trudeau in power! At some point you have to say enough is enough.

You ask me about Doug Ford, not a fan in any sense of the word.

You also feel there is no mutual understanding or common ground. I think if you and I sat down and had a coffee you would be quite surprised. I think the majority of people want sensible middle of the road financially responsible government. Myself, I am certainly interested in a government that attracts business and supports our health and education at the same time. Pro business pro people. Enjoy your day.

You assert that over a cup of coffee, most people would agree with your definition of “sensible middle of the road financially responsible government” such that they would then conclude along with you that Alberta could not survive four more years of a Liberal government.

Well, thank you for sharing a bit about yourself. I am a little longer in the tooth, was born and raised in Toronto (you may have heard of it), moved to Edmonton as a young man looking for work, and my first month in Alberta was greeted by the then mayor of Calgary complaining about those bums and creeps from the east. Never went back.
To my earlier point that debate is futile, your ‘very simple math’ explanation doesn’t sway me at all. I like it here. I think I’m lucky to be here. I chose to make this place my home and to raise a family here. I could tell you a dozen short-sighted stupid things I have watched conservative Alberta governments do over the years. But, I think my whining would be no more persuasive to you than yours was for me. Of course we could sit together and have coffee without coming to fisticuffs. But we both have complaints, and we each have incompatibly different ideas about the solutions. So, let me try this for why and see where we get: I am frustrated with my fellow Albertans. But you suffer under a foreign yoke. My problem is hard to resolve; yours is easy.

Brian, I am from Saskatchewan where our economy is much like yours in Alberta. Are things getting better economically now that Jason Kenny is premier?

Do you believe that selling more oil will improve the price it fetches. Historically more goods for sale lowers the price whereas more demand for fewer goods raises the price.

I hope that things do get better for Alberta, but doubt that will happen before the province diversifies its economy. Alberta has prospered since the early forties when oil was discovered in plentiful supply. This happened with a conservative government (social credit) and continued until 2014 under the Progressive Conservatives of Lougheed and his successors, but when the price of oil collapsed due to too much supply created by fracking largely in the US and Canada.

Likely the only reason the NDP won in 2015 was the collapse of the oil price and the Prentice government blaming the public for wanting government services like health care and education coupled with his austerity approach to correcting the revenue shortfall the province had.

David there is this belief that Alberta’s economy isn’t diversified. Let’s be realistic, we have a strong tourist industry, farming industry, lumber industry, construction industry, our economy is just as diversified as any province in Canada. The problem in Alberta is that our government revenue is too dependant on the oil industry. When the price of oil drops, government revenue drops disproportionately because we lose royalties and corporate taxes. Every province in Canada except Alberta has a sales tax, Jim Prentice was right, we need to look in the mirror, we have no one to blame but ourselves and until we implement a sales tax in Alberta the roller coaster ride in government revenues will never end. Enjoy your day.

A thoughtful column. Happy Canada Day.

On another apparently upbeat note, the ranchers of Alberta are raising cattle whose hitherto unchecked flatulence is now 15% less, according to a McDonalds TV ad. This is indeed a revelation which on the surface of it might allow the continuation of mediocre factory-burger-munching forever, although the cattle arrayed behind the gravelly-voiced grandpaw spokesman looked rather dubious. The subliminal message? Keep away from those knitted plant Beyond Meat saltcakes A&W are peddling, ya hear?

However, was MickyD’s forthcoming enough to let us know whether that’s 15% less methane per head, or in the grand total, which would seem more likely? Because, to steal a quote from The Western Producer: “The number of beef cows fell .8 percent to 3.9 million head as of Jan. 1, following a downward trend that began in 2006.” So amazingly enough, fewer cows mean less methane eruption. Who knew? Who could possibly have guessed? Talk about creative manipulation. Give ’em half the story. A Farmer Brian type of statistic, then. Correct but not qualified in context, the Con game in full swing.

Yes, no programmed carbon tax refunds to the taxpayer are ever mentioned because the Con publicity machine is officially blind to facts, and anti-any-tax as self-professed market fundamentalists often are, so they squawk, whine, profess unmitigated outrage, and deny climate change while looking like prehistoric dunces. Scheer seems as weak an aw shucks brainwashed Con dolt as ever, while claiming he’d give that Chinese Commie leader a verbal dressing down and get him to release those Canadians and buy our canola again, because Andy is big, bad and mean, recently having smashed his way out of a wet paper bag in no uncertain terms. His fantasy is about as likely as a Grade 1 kid beating up the local Grade 12 bully, but words are cheap.

Can we withstand the earthy prognostications of an Alberta crowd officially dedicated to the uncontained growth of a 1950’s social existence in a time of climate change? Personally, whenever a Con opens its mouth, I wait to hear the latest fib some petro-corporatist-funded think tank has issued as “talking point for the day”. Ethics and honesty are thrown to the winds as not worth the trouble. Why confuse people with truthful knowledge? Whip ’em up into a seething froth of resentment instead, it’s easier.

So we have two miserable choices for PM this fall, one each from the Liberals and Conservatives. One helter-skelter whippet who proclaims he loves Canada and jobs no matter how retained, and one stolid unimaginative clod with only one thought — free markets solve everything, I read it in a book. Gee, what standout choices! The NDP are useless, adrift at sea, so I really couldn’t vote for any party but Green. Don’t care if they aren’t “ready”, it’s no more outre than voting for the established idiots in any sane intellectual sense. And much more likely to get something done about climate change than the put-it-on-the- shelf-forever main parties, who need a major shaking up.

What a time to be alive!

“One wonders how many Conservatives are seriously contemplating voting for Maxime Bernier and his batty far-right People’s Party just to overcome the nagging sensation of Scheer indifference.” They key take-away is “how many,” not “if.” Voters everywhere are in the mood to throw the proverbial wrench into their political traditions, the result presumed incapable of being worse than what is assumed nadir-bad at present, with the hope of something even marginally better —anything, doesn’t matter what—outweighing the prayer mumbled on the half-wing.

The Greens are the only party that can possibly benefit from this pervasive political malaise of ours—but, as you point out, they’re too small yet to take full advantage.

Did Osama bin Laden win? Is the cacophonous colossus of the West about to meet its historian, with China, having patiently awaited its revenge for the Opium War and Boxer Rebellion, flooding the Streets of the Laredo with deadly cheap fentanyl, and the Russians availing the economies of social-media scale to interfere with democracy on the cyber cheap? The Great Bogey Man theory of history is tempting, there being so many that one or another can be found and erected a milestone for nearly any bracketed epoch. Suffice to say that the beginning of this malaise coincided with the attack on the Twin Towers lo these nineteen years ago, but that myriad factors like climate change, social impoverishment and Neoliberal play for all the marbles, all related, have been important, too.

Still, the correlation between the kind of democratic risk-taking we see now and palpable geopolitical unrest is fairly weak. During the infamous inter World War period, for example, political strain was rather expressed by partisan diversity, whereas today, post-911, the expression has not so much inspired new parties but, rather, amplified wishful attempts to return to better times—even ones that never really existed, or at least only in very particular ways generally unattainable today. All sorts of charlatans have ascended the ladder, lately, disguised as politicians of the past. Only when even that faint hope has expired have voters been ready to risk a tRump, a Brexit, a Trudeau Two-Point-Oh-Oh or a Rachel Notley. We shall duly note the effect of social media—where everybody’s been talking about climate change lately. Somebody once said it doesn’t matter what they say about [climate change], just so long’s they talkin about [whether it’s weather or not].

The pseudoCons have really conned themselves on this phenomenon by embracing the perennially dissatisfied instead of the newly disaffected: there’ll always be pissed-off rednecks who’ll defend their pickup trucks and who dislike “foreigners” (even Canadian ones) but it’s not apparent there are any more of them than there is a quickly growing number of voters disturbed by political inaction on issues affecting them right now, like income disparity and environmental degradation. Nothing exposes the neo-rightists as charlatans more than the fact they have nothing to return to of their own—since they never were conservative in any way except name, anyhow. “Make Canada Great Again” for Scheer means “Make Canada Harper’s Again.” Anybody who’s paid attention knows that era was a retrogressive bust that never would have happened if Harper had been a real Tory and not a neoliberal usurper and saboteur of Canadian democratic sovereignty.

Too bad for Andrew because there’s plenty of disappointed voters out there he might have appealed to instead of recklessly inviting neo-Nazis and religious whackos into the party. These are the representatives, I guess, of the good ole days he’d like to “return” to. While many dissatisfied voters truly do want a return to more equitable, healthier times, Scheer incredibly produced a climate action plan, ostensibly prescriptive, that completely ignores the causes of climate change because, presumably, he’s become too far committed to the snarling extremists already recruited to make up for his party’s natural attrition and abandonment by moderate conservatives—counterintuitively, slogans, for all their simplicity, are extremely difficult for extremists to exchange. A real leader would have focused on building a more ethically stable base—even if it required forfeiting a mandate or two.

JT is retro to begin with; that’s the main reason he won: people longed for a time before the HarperCons ruined so much of our political decorum, and JT’s name reminded of a certain pirouetted irreverence that outraged the Cons of the day (because they were real Conservatives who believed in decorum). Nationalistic tinkering with Alberta’s petroleum resource is what got JT’s father so hated in the West. At least it’s a real past, regardless its dubious attainability by way of nationalized pipelines today. Score one for the Kid? His attempt at looking forward at least pays lip service to voters’ concerns—and it sounded great until proved hollow in the four years following his landmark victory. He can say at least he tried, but it’s been, for all that, another example of risk-taking by a frustrated electorate.

Dippers got so mad at their leader for taking the neo-right globe into account (Mulcair had the unforgivable audacity to propose a balanced budget), and for not unfurling the red flag, that they fired him despite having won the second highest number of seats in their party’s history under his leadership and, amazingly, retaining many of the Quebec seats they’d first won by mere default during the same Liberal collapse that gave us Harper. Frustrated risk-talking? How’s about electing a leader who would not be allowed to perform public service in the province that supplies over a third of his caucus?—and who definitely will not be unfurling his Sikh turban anytime soon! It’s hard to discern whether the move is progressive or merely progressively frustrated.

It is dangerous times when the anti-politician is so advantaged by widespread voter frustration. It may be that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger but, having survived Harper and (for me here in BC) the BC Liberals, I’m not sure we’re in such strong condition right now—at least not yet. I look at progressive moves in such an environment as hopeful if not yet entirely helpful. It wouldn’t surprise me if it takes all of nineteen years from the ouster’s of Harper and Christy Clark just to get back to zero. That is, if we have that much time before being forced to wake up to an evacuation order.

Happy Dominion Day and GSTQ.

Until recently, perhaps around the time of harper, it seemed clear that whatever party led in Parliament, whatever side an MP came down on, it was always for the greater good of Canada, that they always fought for a better, more perfect liberal democracy.
Conservatives today are nothing more than shills for big business, they are corporatists not conservatives. And Liberals, by not aggressively pushing back the conservative nonsense and standing for liberal values, risk becoming corporatist-lite.
Every leader today has to consider the implications of their current position over the next decade on issues of petro-development and the next-generation of livability and success factors. More of the same will expose that leader to criminal culpability.
There is little wonder why Elizabeth May is seen as the only credible alternative.

As Yogi Berra said, nostalgia aint what it used to be. I have this feeling some of the strong current anxieties of our country are because we are between a seemingly certain and comfortable past and an very uncertain and unknown future.

It is true we don’t have an obvious great leader right now, but then Chretien – “yesterday’s man”, Mulroney – who was never elected to anything before becoming PC leader and Layton who was a fairly unknown city councilor before becoming NDP leader, were not obviously great either in advance of them taking on their respective leaderships. In fact, I would argue it was only towards the end of their respective times and after that we really took stock of all their accomplishments and abilities.

Right now we have three potential leaders Federally – one who hasn’t lived up to all his hype, but still has some achievements and abilities, one who hasn’t seemed to even connect at all yet, despite the brief initial hype and another who remains quite a bit of a mystery. I suppose given all that Canadians are understandably feeling underwhelmed now. I am hopeful that the actual election campaign will help us to better focus on which is best to lead us forward in the current world and the uncertain future. Maybe we don’t actually need a great leader, Canada is as you state a pretty good country with I think with a fairly good ability to muddle through things somehow. We just need to avoid picking the wrong leader for the times and I think we need a leader that can for the most part be competent.

To paraphrase from what I think are other countries recent mistakes, maybe we need to avoid picking a leader on the basis of making Canada great again. We are and remain one of the best countries in the world and unlike some other countries are relatively unburdened by memories of supposed past greatness. The future will always be uncertain, technology and all the current chaos in the world is adding to that and our anxieties. However, nostalgia is best saved for TV shows and movies.

The Canada I would like to see is one where Liberals stick to being liberal, the NDP sticks to being progressive and the Conservatives stick to being financially conservative.

Liberals should stick to being liberal but cautious instead of copying the Democrats in the US who are no different from Republicans when in government and not at all for working people any more. Leave that stuff for conservatives.

The NDP (now that Mulcair is out of the picture) must realize that there are no votes for them in being centre right. Stick to tried and true progressive ideas that make our society more equal.

The Greens should stick to being environmentally responsible so future generations will have a chance at a life as good as we have had in the last fifty years.

Oh Canada we love you for being liberal progressive. (at least when you are).

Unfortunately, the $2.5-million probe into “foreign funded defamation” of Alberta’s fossil-fuel industry announced by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s government yesterday at a news conference in Calgary isn’t it.


Inquiry Commissioner Steve Allan (Photo: Lieutenant Governor of Alberta).

How could it be? It’s been established to buttress a debunked conspiracy theory that proved useful to the United Conservative Party’s election campaign and may yet have some utility in the efforts of Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party of Canada to win the federal election this fall.

But as was said here when this “inquiry” was still an irresponsible election promise dreamed up by the UCP’s Rebel Media-inspired campaign team, this can be an honest inquiry, or it can be what the government has promised it will be, but it can’t be both.

If you’re looking for a first indicator of which way it’s going to roll, consider the fact it’s not led by an impartial and disinterested judge, as any serious inquiry into any serious issue would be.


Alberta NDP Economic Development Critic Deron Bilous (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I don’t know if Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, who with Energy Minister Sonya Savage seems to be stuck with handling this likely-to-be-embarrassing file, actually talked to any judges about leading this effort, but if he did he must have been laughed out of chambers.

Instead, the inquiry into what Mr. Kenney called “a well-funded political propaganda campaign to defame our energy industry and to land-lock our resources” to the advantage of U.S. energy companies by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Tides Foundation and other U.S. charitable entities will be led by the chair of Calgary Economic Development.

Look, I’m sure Steve Allan is a fine fellow and the “leading forensic and restructuring accountant” described in the government’s news release, but giving responsibility to the leader of a city office set up to sell corporate investors on the benefits of opening branch offices in Cowtown is not a sound strategy for a serious inquiry. Giving the holder of such an office the title of commissioner and subpoena power under the province’s Public Inquiries Act is ludicrous.

As CED describes itself on its website, “Calgary Economic Development is a conduit, connector, catalyst and storyteller.” It’s fair to say, at least, that Mr. Allan obviously has the right background for the job Mr. Kenney obviously has in mind for him.


Prominent environmentalist Tzeporah Berman (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But only a judge could be the “effective and impartial commissioner,” Mr. Schweitzer described. And it’s doubtful any judge would take on an inquiry with the terms of reference of this one.

It’s also not a good sign that Mr. Kenney repeatedly pointed to commentaries by a Vancouver blogger beloved of the energy industry to back up his dubious claim that $75 million has been expended on this conspiracy.

NDP Economic Development Critic Deron Bilous described the inquiry as a “glorified Google search,” but Vancouver-based environmentalist Tzeporah Berman came closer to the mark when she tweeted that “what is disturbing about this Alberta Inquiry is government using power of the state to harass citizens who disagree with their agenda to expand the oil and gas industry despite the growing threat of climate change. This Inquiry is about civil liberties.”


Energy journalist Markham Hislop (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Even Stephen Harper committed to phasing out fossil fuels in this century, Ms. Berman noted in another tweet. “Attacking free speech will not turn back the clock.”

Energy journalist Markham Hislop called the inquiry the “Un-Alberta Activities Committee” and described its mandate as conducting a “witch hunt.”

Indeed, Premier Kenney described the tactics of this supposed “disinformation and defamation” campaign as “litigation, public protests and political lobbying,” all activities that are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in case the UCP missed it.

So if Mr. Kenney expects to use the findings of this inquiry as the basis of a legal effort to harass and sue critics of the fossil fuel industry, the outcome in the courts is likely to be both disappointing and expensive for Alberta taxpayers, even if they sincerely believe Alberta’s fossil fuel industry has been badly done by.

The premier half-heartedly conceded this point yesterday, responding to a reporter’s question with the admission “we can’t project in outside jurisdictions.” D’ya think? Anyone basing a lawsuit on the findings of this group will be laughed out of court, and not just an American court either.

Anyway, it’ll be a relief to Alberta taxpayers and voters to learn the causes of the energy industry’s troubles are not, as the Houston Chronicle explained on Tuesday, caused by rising production, weakening demand, and skeptical investors.

The inquiry is supposed to report on July 2, 2020. That’s the Thursday after a mid-week Canada Day holiday, an excellent day to bury any disappointment if the findings turn out to be somewhat underwhelming.

Thank you, President Trump!

Speaking of inquiries, senior officers of the British Army are sure to be poring over their records from the 18th Century to find out how George Washington’s ragtag rebel insurgents got the jump on them and seized control of their airports during the American Revolutionary War, 1775-1783, as revealed by U.S. President Donald Trump in his speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington yesterday.

I am personally grateful to President Trump for solving one of the enduring mysteries of the Climenhaga family, explaining how the excellent Third Waldeck Regiment, German mercenaries in British service said to have included one Heinrich Kleimenhagen, did so poorly.

Obviously, Gen. Washington’s troops destroyed the Hessians’ helicopters on the ground. Either that, or President Trump was having trouble seeing his teleprompter screen through the raindrops","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

I suppose Mr. Kenney’s is doing his bit to stimulate some sectors of the Alberts economy. The legal sector seems to be a bit busier with challenges to the carbon tax, Postmortal media may get a boost with the war room on environmentalists and now an inquiry into them will give a bit of a boost to CED employees. Fortunately the NDP left him a lower than expected deficit, so he has a bit of mad money to spend on such mad ideas.

I can’t see this inquiry resulting in much, particularly as most of the groups the UCP seems to want to blacklist operate mainly outside of Alberta. What will Kenney do, take away their Federal charitable status? He must be confusing Federal and Provincial powers again. Actually, wasn’t that what the Federal Harper government he was a part of tried to do before? I suppose in Kenney’s defense, it all probably starts to blur for the guy who seems to be perpetually campaigning for the next big position, whether available yet or not.

Perhaps Mr. Trump assumed that because Britain as it was well known had naval superiority, it must have also had control of the airports in the US before the time of the American revolution. Sadly, airplanes and hence airports did not exist until over 100 years later. Apparently history is not Mr. Trump’s strong point – what a surprise!

If someone chooses to make a donation to the Pembina Institute, there is a place on the page for the donor to make their donation in honour of someone, and a place to submit the honouree’s email address as well, presumably so the PI can advise the honouree of the donation. This gives extra motivation to donate! Give your donation in honour or Jason Kenney, Lorne Gunter, Danielle Smith, David Staples,…

No shortage of irony here. As far as pipelines and oilsands expansion go, the Pembina Institute and Jason Kenney are pretty much on the same side.

Former Pembina executive director Ed Whittingham just wrote an op-ed in the Globe & Mail in support of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion. Parroting CAPP’s talking points.

Current Pembina executive director Simon Dyer pens op-eds in The Edmonton Journal preaching “responsible oilsands development”. An oxymoron, if ever there was one. No scientific basis.

Nothing says “Trumpian” like a good ole American-style witch hunt, funded by taxpayers and conjured up by Alberta’s card-carrying coven of political deplorables.

While low-income kids are likely to go hungry in schools this fall, with the cancellation of the NDP’s Alberta’s School Nutrition program by the UCP, $2.5 million (plus additional court costs) will be wasted on a frivolous campaign designed to reward conservative sycophants and acolytes beholden to Jason Kenney. Sad.

Here’s the proper subject of a public inquiry into the history and state of AB democracy with the purpose of taking it back for the citizenry; a supposed democracy now hollowed out and operated from inside the gov’t by oilsands corporations.

Oilsands tailings leaking into the Athabasca River and groundwater,
First Nation citizens downstream giving up on eating fish/animals from the polluted waterways,
0.1% reclamation of oilsands mining operations for over 50 years,
intense fragmentation/loss of intact forests due to exploration/development of in-situ oilsands is a major factor in caribou herds declining toward extinction around the oilsands,
and industry demanding it be allowed to use experimental unproven freshwater capping of tailings ponds rather than cleaning them up thus avoiding tens of billions of reclamation costs while the 5 major oilsands mining companies make billions in profits every quarter as they automate and lay off workers.

Fifty years of oilsands equals only 0.1% of land reclaimed

excerpt: ‘Taft is not the first author to criticize Alberta for being a willing hostage to the oil industry, but he doesn’t call the province a petrostate. He calls it an “oil deep state”: “Petrostates are conceived in petroleum, while oil deep states are captured by petroleum.”

In other words, we had democracy in Alberta until we discovered oil.’

As you point our DC, wouldn’t it make sense to examine foreign lobbying expenditures on both sides? From the Guardian, March 22, 2019:
“The largest five stock market listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m (£153m) a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change, according to a new report. Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil were the main companies leading the field in direct lobbying to push against a climate policy to tackle global warming, the report said.”

“Separately, BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state – $1m of which was spent on social media ads, the research shows.”

Of little interest to JK et al seems to be any other “Alberta energy” production. What is of interest is merely extractive industries, whether tar sands, fracked sites, or other liquid resources, and their use and export. No mention (nor support I am sure) of the wind power ‘energy’ resources throughout the province now, nor of all the cities, towns, villages, and Indigenous People’s communities that have put bucks and backs to work to install solar electricity production. No mention of the ‘energy’ possibilities of geothermal, whether existing residential and business installations, nor even [neighbourhood] plant scale electricity production which could be achieved.
Seems we continue to do the one-trick-pony routine of fossil fuel extraction as the saviour of our “energy”!

Those pesky environmentalists, foreign-funded by people trying to stop Alberta’s right to pollute and generally act like cowboys oblivious of any interest except their own, just cheese Jason off. No doubt he’s advised the Pope to mind his own business on climate change too. US and foreign funded petro-state propaganda is of course welcome. But, Jason wants to stamp out people trying to save the world because Alberta knows better – climate change isn’t happening. Kenney at his weirdest. Misplaced paranoia about sums up his attitude.

As for Trump, well a bozo never changes its spots. Probably the reference to airports flew right past many of the Trump Chumps sittin’ at home guzzlin’ beer on the Fourth. High school education ain’t what it used to be, especially in poor counties. The US has no collective sense of humour about itself. That to me has always been the difference between the current US Empire and that of the Brits before them. The Brits were always quite happy to have a joke at their own cultural expense.

137,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Stephen Harper’s proposed restrictions on bitumen exports caused no uproar – so why the fury at Justin Trudeau,2019-07-07 01:32:00,David Climenhaga,,"Late last week, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer was once again accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Government of wanting to phase out the oilsands, as he put it, and passing laws to put that putative plan into action.

Notwithstanding a lack of persuasive evidence, the popularity of this refrain here in Alberta never seems to wane.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Perhaps there’s a subtle distinction that escapes the uneducated layperson’s eye, but can someone in Mr. Scheer’s Conservative Parliamentary Caucus or Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party explain the difference between Mr. Trudeau’s restrictions on bitumen exports and Stephen Harper’s plan for the same thing?

Oh, I know, any real Albertan believes Prime Minister Trudeau’s bitumen export plan calls for our province’s vast resources to be land-locked and the Canadian economy destroyed in the name of airy-fairy environmentalism while former Conservative prime minister Harper’s plan was a wise blueprint for their prudent and environmentally friendly development to the benefit of all mankind.

Seriously, though, on closer examination – which is not easy amid the current nearly hysterical state of political discourse in Alberta fostered by our recent provincial election and Mr. Kenney’s harsh anti-Trudeau rhetoric since then – it would appear there’s not actually a lot of light between Mr. Trudeau’s plan now and that of Mr. Harper back in the day.

Leastways, 11 odd years ago on Sept. 26, 2008, the Reuters News Agency was mildly complaining that Mr. Harper’s plan “would ban exports of tar-like bitumen from Alberta’s oilsands to countries that do not match Canada’s efforts to cut carbon emissions.”

Say what!?

According to Reuters, both the fossil fuel industry and environmentalists were “perplexed” by this Conservative Party of Canada policy. The environmentalists because they didn’t feel it went far enough, especially with regards to Canada’s own emissions, and the industry because it claimed it needed more time to study the details.

Still, reading between the lines, it was clear that the spokesperson for Enbridge Inc., whose Northern Gateway Pipeline proposal was then still a thing, didn’t much like the idea of any restrictions whatsoever.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, left, and Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andre Forget, Wikimedia Commons).

As for the unrestricted access to Asian markets that we Albertans have all now been persuaded we simply must have, Mr. Harper was blunt, telling journalists in Ottawa that, in the words of the Reuters reporter, his policy “could affect Asian countries that are the target of a proposed Enbridge Inc. pipeline that would move oil sands-derived crude to Canada’s West Coast to be shipped across the Pacific Ocean by tanker.”

Of course, at the time Mr. Harper was campaigning for re-election and hoping to turn his Conservative minority in Parliament into a majority. Perhaps he hoped to woo some Canadians who wanted both economic expansion and caps on carbon emissions into his camp – you know, very much like what Mr. Trudeau is trying to do right now, and certainly what former Alberta NDP premier Rachel Notley’s government was also trying to achieve.

Jack Layton, by the way, who was then the leader of the NDP, called this balancing act “absurd.” He wondered how Mr. Harper could propose emissions caps for countries that might want to import Canadian bitumen when he wasn’t willing to set any here in Canada.


The late Jack Layton, leader of the NDP, campaigning in Edmonton in 2011 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Well, whatever. The point is, there’s not really much difference between what Mr. Harper was proposing then and what Mr. Trudeau is doing now. This is true regardless of unfounded claims to the contrary now appearing regularly in once respectable newspapers like the Calgary Herald, which ought to know better.

Then, the idea that Ottawa might dare to control where Alberta could export its bitumen, for environmental reasons no less, caused barely a murmur of protest on the right. Now we have a Conservative politicians talking seriously about how the same thing is a grave threat to national unity.

How can Mr. Trudeau’s modest environmental measures in the context of aggressive development of the oilsands and pipeline infrastructure be tantamount to treason, according to people like Premier Kenney, while Mr. Harper’s were a guarantee of environmental common sense and long-term Canadian prosperity?

What’s changed, in other words?

Well, for the better part of the last decade we’ve been on the receiving end of an unremitting, well-funded campaign by the fossil fuel industry that without pipelines to all points of the compass, our economy is doomed. A good part of the funds for this campaign, I daresay, came from foreign sources.

Our provincial governments, Conservative and NDP alike, enthusiastically joined this clamour. They have claimed repeatedly Alberta must, simply must, have unlimited and unrestricted pipeline access to Canada’s coastlines east and west so that we can find new markets for our underpriced oilsands crude, never mind the law of supply and demand.

But the only truly significant thing that is different at this moment, I would suggest, is simply this:there’s a Liberal government in Ottawa.

That, in turn, suggests that all this hysteria amounts to a cynical and dishonest political campaign on behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada. And if this campaign ends up actually threatening Canadian unity, those Conservatives don’t care a fig!

Quite an amusing article David, I am always fascinated by the influence ideology has on our interpretation of present and past events. You attempt to compare a statement made during an election campaign by Stephen Harper to laws C-48 and C-69 enacted by Justin Trudeau, giving both the same level of relevancy. Hardly a fair comparison, what is said to get elected is quite often forgotten once elected, many examples of this with Justin Trudeau.

Going by memory if I go back to 2008 the pipeline of greatest interest would have been Keystone XL. After doing a little googling it appears Enbridge began actively pursuing approval of Northern Gateway in February of 2008. Also worth noting that on April 14, 2005 Enbridge announced a $2.5 billion deal with PetroChina Co. to transport oil along the proposed line, Enbridge originally announced preliminary plans to build a pipeline to the British Columbia coast back in 2002. Interestingly 2008 was the same year that Corpethics(originally called Corporate Ethics International, based in San Francisco)helped conceive the anti Tar Sands campaign, a campaign that has helped stall both Keystone XL(they take credit for this on their site) and the TransMountain expansion. In the last 10 years the U.S.A. has went from producing 5 million barrels a day to 12 million a day, this has changed the world oil market and attracted a lot of investment. In the last 4 years the lack of movement on pipeline construction and changes in government policy have caused many foreign companies to divest themselves of their oil sand assets. Again ideology comes into play on whether you believe the pro oil or anti oil forces have spent more money or won the day. Myself I would say that those fighting against pipeline construction in Canada have been more successful.

One last question, you give me the impression that you think Justin Trudeau is doing a good job for Alberta and by extension Canada, if this is the case why do opinion polls only give him about 18% support in Alberta?

Brian: as you observe, Trudeau buying a heavy oil pipeline has not swayed Alberta voters. Perhaps this is because many people in Alberta have accepted your argument that if only there was a pipeline the world price for heavy oil would justify more work in the patch. How more heavy oil sales from the tar sands translates to more service work in the conventional oil and gas basin where all the high paying jobs once existed is never explained. As to tankers to Asia, that market was never there (see China’s Belt and Road initiative) except in the minds of certain stock promoters and speculators who took China for granted (not unlike certain canola farmers).

Perhaps you could also explain how adding more heavy oil to to a world market already awash in heavy AND light oil will raise prices here in Alberta. Or is this a mystery only revealed to a religious mystic like Mr. Kenney? I see why Mr. Kenney would push such an illogical narrative to vulnerable and frightened people who understand deep in their hearts that they peed away the last oil boom of this century, but where is your class interest as a farmer in all this?

Finally, isn’t the essence of this blog post that what Mr. Harper proposed, Mr. Trudeau intends to impose?

To counter the blow back from the impending cross the board 5% wage roll back for all provincial, municipal, university, law enforcement, school board and health care employees, the government will reduce MLA salaries at the same time. That won’t happen until after the federal election to avoid Kenney providing austerity fodor during the federal campaign. Kenney can easily make the MLA cut retroactive.

Your last question is a good one in that it exposes the hyper-partisanship of politics in general these days and Conservative thinking in Alberta specifically.

Trudeau and Notley did more for the O&G industry than I had seen up until then. Buying a dead in the water pipeline, promoting it by Notely 24/7 the last couple years of her mandate. Picking fights with Ottawa and B.C. during that promotion etc.

I’ve lived in Alberta 30 years and arrived via Saskatchewan. I can tell you one thing I’ve learned about politics here. 45 years of conservative rule demonstrated how demonizing the federal government and petro dollars can brainwash a populace works.

Federal interference in the oil patch is like the deficit, which is an absolute obsession of the National Post and the Globe and Mail during Liberal governments, but vanishes from the headlines when the PC or Cons take control of the tiller. Because as we know, Conservative governments are the sensible stewards of the economy, even though they tend to leave power with a vastly increased deficit, unlike Liberal governments.

SASQ: because most Albertans are simply deranged in this respect, among others. There are no objective counts on which this Prime Minister’s policies have harmed Alberta’s interests, so the 18% figure you quote—with out supporting links, I notice—it at best simply evidence of the ubiquity of this derangement.

Well, um, except in rare instances Albertans don’t vote Liberal no matter who the leader is or what he does.

EKOS research poll done June 27-29, 2019 puts LPC 15.5%, CPC 65.1%, NDP 5%, Green’s 7%. Abacus Data I believe had the LPC at 25.5% poll taken June 28-July 2. Eric Grenier had an average of the polls with the LPC at 16.9% in Alberta. Personally, if a person believes Justin Trudeau has done a good job I would say they are deranged. As a farmer I would say Justin Trudeau’s original stance when they were trying to start free trade talks with China was not beneficial. They were interested in trade he was interested in gender equity. As a farmer I can’t think of one beneficial thing he has done. From playing Mr. Dress-up in India, the SNC Lavelin affair, and the inability to get anywhere with the Chinese on trade he has done nothing that makes me optimistic about our government! Enjoy your day.

The Conservatives seem to have lately made quite an effort into looking for Liberal scapegoats. Of course, blaming Trudeau for all the country’s ills serves two purposes in Alberta. First, if people buy it, it may help them out politically. Second, now that Alberta has a UCP government, they can no longer so easily blame the previous NDP government for all the provinces problems, so it gives them someone else to shift the blame to as the Alberta economy does not seem to have yet magically boomed, as the UCP at times promised it would during the provincial election.

The Harper Conservatives tended to be hyper partisan and well just kind of nasty to the their political opponents and often made exaggerated statements about them that did not stand up to scrutiny. I think a lot of Canadians were actually put off by this excessive political nastiness and after their first attempt to demonize Trudeau in the last Federal election failed spectacularly. It seemed for a while the Conservatives had learned a lesson from that and were going to try to be a bit kinder and gentler. Well that didn’t seem to last that long.

I suppose the Conservatives can blame Trudeau for the state of the Alberta economy, whether true or not if they want. It might even win them a seat or two more in the west in the next Federal election, but really there is not much for them to gain here as they already have most of the seats. However, I wonder if this strategy might be counter productive elsewhere in the country. For instance, if Trudeau is responsible for the allegedly sad state of the Alberta economy, then shouldn’t the Conservatives not be giving him credit where the economy is doing much better, say in Ontario, Quebec, BC and many other parts of Canada? I doubt they will give any credit, thus they will be delivering two mixed messages – where the economy is bad, its Trudeau’s fault, not the say the price of oil and where it is good, forget about giving him credit. So to some extent the Conservatives obsessive desire to blame Trudeau for Alberta’s economic situation undermines the message they want to deliver in other parts of Canada where there are seats available to potentially win.

But I was shocked last week both by the specious and dishonest attacks by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s Rebel-Media-trained social media meme-makers and the way Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland immediately threw the man under the bus in response.

The proximate cause of the calumny heaped on Mr. McCallum was an interview with the South China Morning Post. In it, the former Canadian ambassador to China suggested Beijing would be wise not to punish Canada further over the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. By doing so, he argued, the Chinese Government risked helping to elect a government likely to be considerably less friendly to China than the one in power now.

In his remarks to the venerable Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper, Mr. McCallum also urged China not to inflict any more “punishments” on Canadian exports, a reference to recent official Chinese bans on imports of Canadian agricultural products such as canola and beef.


Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In addition, he noted the importance of Canadian business people continuing to visit China in preparation for the day when problems between the two countries inevitably blow over. He suggested this would likely happen in time for the 50th anniversary next year of prime minister Pierre Trudeau’s opening to China on Oct. 13, 1970.

This was clearly a reference to the two Canadian business people, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who are being held hostage by Chinese officials supposedly for spying in what is a transparent effort to spring Ms. Meng from Canadian house arrest.

So for looking out for the interests of Canadian farmers and two Canadians unjustly held in deplorable conditions in China because of Canada’s foolish attempt to support the lawless Trump Administration’s effort to use Ms. Meng as a bargaining chip in its own trade dispute with that country, the Conservative Online Rage Machine instantly spun Mr. McCallum’s words into an invitation to a foreign power by to interfere in Canada’s election.

This is patent nonsense, clearly not Mr. McCallum’s intent. Such hysteria would be amusing if three Canadians were not languishing in Chinese jails, the third being the schmuck charged with drug smuggling by the Chinese who had his sentence “upgraded” to ratchet up pressure on Canada to let Ms. Meng go.

Never mind that Mr. McCallum doesn’t speak for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, and owes it nothing – it canned him as ambassador last December, for heaven’s sake, for daring to state the obvious truth that the U.S. case against Ms. Meng is shaky and politically motivated.

Above all, don’t forget that, just as he spoke the truth in December, Mr. McCallum’s assertion a Conservative government would be hostile to China is obviously true.

Indeed, it’s worse than what he said. While Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals are embarrassingly sensitive to U.S. President Donald Trump’s whims, a government led by Mr. Scheer would be craven in its toadying to the Trump Administration, not to mention dangerously hostile to the Democratic Party administration that will likely replace it. That, obviously, is because they agree with most of Mr. Trump’s policies.

That would be bad for China, bad for Canada, and bad for anyone concerned with preserving a rules-based world trading system.

For their part, disgracefully, Conservatives clearly would rather let a few Canadians rot in foreign jails on trumped up charges than surrender any electoral advantage in October.

As for Ms. Freeland’s instant capitulation to this transparent Conservative tactic, it seems likely she was paying too much attention to the diplomatic pros at Fort Pearson, who doubtless resented a former politician’s appointment to a prestigious diplomatic post.

Their reputation for enthusiastically representing Canadians in trouble with the law abroad is, to put it diplomatically, somewhat mixed. (Who can forget the department’s horrifying neglect of William Sampson, the British-Canadian biochemist imprisoned, tortured, raped, and sentenced to death on trumped up charges by the appalling Saudi Arabian regime; Maher Arar, handed over to the United States by Canadian police and shipped off to Syria to be tortured; or Quebec photographer Zahra Kazemi, murdered in an Iranian jail in 2003?)

Ms. Freeland would have done better to treat Mr. Scheer’s obviously dishonest claims and his cavalier disregard for the fate of his fellow citizens abroad with the deep contempt they deserve.

The Conservative success stampeding the foreign affairs minister into attacking Mr. McCallum may explain why they have now tried to crank up more hysteria with risible calls for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service to investigate Mr. McCallum’s remarks. CSIS would do better, it’s said here, to investigate Conservative support for Alberta separatists, who actually pose a threat to national security.

Friends and relatives of Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, not to mention independent-minded Canadian farmers, would be justified feeling grateful to Mr. McCallum for his efforts on their behalf, disgusted with Ms. Freeland for turning her back on him, and furious with Mr. Scheer and his Rebel Media minions for doing what they can to keep obviously innocent men in jail if it serves their political ends","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

While what Mr McCallum said about how Canadian electoral politics might affect Canada-China relations—already dismal—might have been true, in international diplomacy, candour is often unwise: he ought not have said it publicly. However, to charge that in dong so, he was encouraging Chinese interference in the election is ludicrous. In fact, he was doing nothing of the sort, since what he was so indiscreetly suggesting does not constitute “interference”, which implicitly means illicit tampering, but simply stating a reality of politics: that when you exert unsubtle pressure on a government facing the electorate to act in a certain way towards your own country’s interests, while its opponents favour acting in a different way, the rule is “be careful what you wish for”.

As for the Meng case, it is abundantly clear that the Chinese government simply fails to appreciate what an independent judiciary and the rule of law mean in a democracy. They think that PM Trudeau can simply free Ms Meng at the stroke of a pen—which might in fact technically be true, although I’m no lawyer, but is essentially impossible from a legal and public policy perspective—and so they are exerting intense pressure on the Trudeau government to do just that. The only hope for a resolution to this impasse is for the courts, in their wisdom, to realize independently that the US has no case and to deny their application for her extradition.

Mr Scheer, for his part, has failed to state clearly what he would have done differently had he been Prime Minister. Would he have sprung Ms Meng, as the Trudeau government has refused to do on legitimate grounds? Would he have shipped her off to the States by now, instead of allowing the legal process to play out on its own schedule? One would have satisfied China, but have been fatal to Canada’s reputation as a reliable partner in matters such as extradition; the other would have satisfied the US but seriously pissed off China, and any Canadians in China would be in peril. But for Mr Scheer to simply rant that the Trudeau government has mishandled this file, without saying what he would have done differently, is just as vacuous as Jason Kenney assailing the Notley NDP for lack of progress on pipelines, as though there were anything anyone could have done differently in light of the decisions of the courts.

Recall, Jerry, that the comments by Mr. McCallum that have sent Canadian Conservatives over the top were made long after he was a diplomat, after he had been humiliatingly fired from that post. As for the oft-made claim Canada is acting in accordance with the rule of law in the Meng case, I am highly skeptical. The U.S. case against Ms. Meng is so openly fraudulent, the president of the United States has stated as much. There is such a thing as realpolitik in this world. Canada would have been wiser to give Ms. Meng a nudge in the direction of the airport and than waited 24 hours before acting on the U.S. warrant. Any sensible nation, including the United States, would have done this in the same circumstances. I have always suspected that rogue elements within the national police force, knowing this and wanting to hurt the prime minister, acted without informing their superiors. Regardless, we’re stuck with this mess now, since the only thing worse for us than infuriating China would be infuriating the United States. DJC

“ …I have always suspected that rogue elements within the national police force, knowing this and wanting to hurt the prime minister, acted without informing their superiors…” Hmmm … interesting hypothesis, but lacking in available evidence. My view? As someone once famously said, “never ascribe to malice what can reasonably be attributed to incompetence.”

We shouldn’t ever forget the incredible “liteness” of Justin Trudeau. “JT-lite” was only ever half-lighted by the niqab-black darkness of Stephen Harper from whom The Kid seized power in an improbable, come-from-behind election campaign which the rookie leader of a recently third-placed party encapsulated in his victory maxim: “Sunny ways, my friends, and sunny days.” The new PM gave us the shaft of sunlight after the red hot poker of Harper-Nacht.

The vast majority of Canadians rejoiced in relief that the Con base was not so deep. But even low relief casts long shadows in the obliqueness of this mandate’s setting sun, and the acting CEO of the shadow cabinet now searches as frantically as a blind man in the fleeting umbra of the thin, dusky wedge, a silhouette on sable, for any opaqueness his predecessor’s better might have cast during his incredible lightness of being the Sunny Boy of Canadian politics.

During the incredibly long election writ period Harper arranged in order to blunt potentially embarrassing news from the concurrent Mike Duffy trial, Canadians heard a surfeit of allegations that JT was “just not ready” to govern a complex country like Canada. As true as that might have turned out, the youngest contender was definitely not ready to concede to a Senate Harper-thug in the ring, nor to second-place HarperCon or first-place MulcairDipper geezers in the running whom he blew past while cheerily turning cartwheels and hand-springs (a pirouette would have been a bit too pretentious, perhaps). A deep desire for change among the electorate and a sort of endorsement from a father whose fame transcends even death certainly didn’t detract from the young candidate’s glad-handing. Nevertheless, betting on a leader of such light credentials required hedging, whence the promised legalization of Marijuana and electoral reform.

Both promises should have been shoe-ins: the first given that medical Cannabis had already been protected by the courts and technically illegal recreational pot had been openly retailed from storefronts with relative impunity for years, was almost a throwaway cookie of relatively little political risk—and it was literally mother’s milk for the Christmas Baby, JT. But electoral reform was played very poorly. We don’t yet know what cynical politics might have come into play here, but the unworkability of JT’s campaign promise (that ‘FPtP’ would be eliminated for some other system, TBA) should have been a tell: perhaps because it was promised so early in the campaign, long before he’d started to eclipse his superior rivals, nobody really noticed actual lightness camouflaged by presumed lightness.

Doubtless many voted for JT’s ER promise and perhaps as many will not again in their disappointment, sharpened by the notion that such an unlikely victor should have also had the capacity to implement a new electoral system forthwith, without the referendum, despite every survey suggested 75% of Canadians wanted one with ‘FPtP’ on the ballot, not disqualified as he’d so foolishly or cynically proposed. Again, the two possibilities allow lightness to be disguised as the kind of political shrewdness we too often forgive as necessary mendacity. A cynical ploy to dupe the Cons on the special ER Committee into relieving JT of his ill-considered (?) promise would at least also relieve its otherwise apparent lightness. Maybe it’s more than mere coincidence that the Cons can hardly make hay of what might be judged one of JT’s most egregious and consequential failures: they could, I guess, claim to have ‘saved Canada’ from proportional representation (or whatever it might have been), but not without looking like they’d been manipulated (when the Liberals relinquished their majority on the Committee) into the role just so JT could escape his promise as he’d planned all along. Win-win, Mr Sunshine?

But the compensating errors of fortune have been working incessantly to show the PM has been relying as heavily on luck as he has been on the advice of others, for good or bad. Rather, he can’t show he’s capable of telling the difference and the SNC-Lavalin/Raybould/Phillpot scandal proved it.

The Sunny Boy persona the new PM cowed to The Donald might have been as light and trite as all that, and an impolitic risk given that more than 20% of Canadians hate American politics—actually, it’s more likely 20% of each do—but making nice with tRump simply cannot be labeled as imprudent. For all his showy obsequiousness and sycophancy, JT ended up getting dirked—which doesn’t necessarily shine a light on his lightness given The Orange One had dirked almost everybody around him, anyways. Indeed, Trump’s “weakness” and “dishonesty” aspersions cast at the PM have already formed part of Con rhetoric, they doubtlessly happy it doesn’t appear too much like it’s been lifted directly from tRump’s playbook. But it remains that the Trudeau government saw to it that the C-Must-D has been nearly ratified (at least for Canada’s part) on condition that US tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum are lifted. Most of this was the work of Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland who had to endure at least as much public boorishness from the President as JT—and probably endured much, much more behind closed doors in negotiation; Her affectionate loyalties paid assiduously to, and her fierce, unstinting defences of the PM are overtly self-confident and maybe, one day, politically ambitious: she wouldn’t have been able to shine as much as she has without JT’s nod, yet she’s careful not to let her successes look like leadership flows uphill, even if it actually did in this instance. She’s content for now to let JT bask in the solar spotlight that magically refuses to reveal too many warts and wrinkles —or to fade, despite many anvil clouds scudding across the horizon.

In pipe-liners, affirmative activists and Aboriginal leaders JT seems to trust to reveal his dependence on naive trust which, in this sense, is well matched with his main rivals and, I suppose, better than appearing paranoid like Trump or Harper. Still, it betrays a certain ineptitude about realpolitik we expect at least from the PMO, if not the PM himself. With regard the SNC-Lavalin debacle it looks like somebody didn’t know what they were doing amongst the tangle of political marionette strings— not Jody, not even the PMO, nor, for sure, JT himself. Nothing good came out of this for the PM—except, maybe, that he got rid of two insubordinates.

But maybe some of the dirked knew what they were doing—maybe Jane did, maybe Jody— but most definitely McCallum: he knows a lot, maybe too much to be an ambassador; perhaps that’s why Chrystia was so quick to refute his astute observations. Maybe she had to do it so JT wouldn’t have learn how to.

Nevertheless, the arrest and pending extradition of Chinese national Meng Wanzhou might be construed as incredible lightness on JT’s part—after all, it would have been so simple to explain to the Whitehouse—which, naturally, wants to trump diplomacy for tRump’s partisan gain by scapegoating Ms Meng’s Chinese company during the US-China tariff war—that Ms Meng has had to be released on a technicality discovered in the extradition filing which legally prevented Canadian border agents from keeping her in the country. We note much has changed since JT submitted to American demands to arrest Ms Meng: the PM now coughs loudly in the President’s presence, knowingly riling the infamous germaphobe—but in the sunniest way possible, knowing the Orange One has descended too far down the dark karmic ladder to retaliate much farther than against those immediately surrounding him in the Whitehouse. Sunny days, my friends—cough!

Certainly the Harper-shadow’s shadow has seized upon this sabre-tooth in a tar-pit with foolhardy courage he won’t get trapped in the ethical goo himself. Thank goodness DJC has put paid to that faint hope.

What nobody seems to be considering is that, sunny ways and sunny days having gotten JT this far, and no amount of “he’s-not-ready” has much dented him yet, he may elect—perhaps, as seems usual, with or without good advice—to continue his incredible lightness of being PM—and leave us wondering, still, if he, for example, simply releases Ms Meng to provoke criticism from tRump that can only help his election campaign on patriotic grounds (as did tRump’s “weak and dishonest” accusation to JT’s popularity polls) or put an electoral reform referendum question on the general election ballot at the last moment to atone for the ER debacle. JT can still do either if he wants or needs. Maybe leaving that option open is why Canadian officials simply didn’t warn Ms Meng to stay out of Canada, letting her know the extradition request would be pressed if she did enter the country. Or maybe they really wanted to cynically bait tRump to contrast in their sunny boss’s favour.

If JT can hang on by any means, his lightness of being PM will have become credible.

But what about the Canadian prisoners held ransom in Chinese prisons? They desperately want to see the lightness of ordinary daylight.

Now, Mr. Trudeau may not have had much to announce, and he may have been surrounded by men and a few women in blue boilersuits when he announced it, but two things must be remembered about this in half-hearted defence of the PM:
First, announcements that don’t contain much news, and re-announcements of things that have already been announced, are absolutely a staple of democratic politics, employed by all political parties in all democratic jurisdictions.

Second, the Conservative Party of Canada and its provincial farm teams are masters of this political art form, as Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and his ministers demonstrate regularly in a stream of government news releases that don’t contain much news.


Mr. Kenney, in his more recent role as premier of Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Not only that, but using humans as props is standard operating procedure, as Mr. Kenney famously illustrated back in his days as federal immigration minister when his department dragooned a dozen professional civil servants into pretending to be new Canadians for a political Kabuki performance put on for the benefit of the Sun News Network.

Say what you will about Mr. Trudeau, at least the blue-boilersuited folks standing by supportively Friday in Edmonton were real workers, not, in effect, actors, and unwilling ones at that, as in the case of Mr. Kenney’s fake citizenship ceremony in 2011. Naturally, Mr. Kenney denied that he was responsible for the hoax, blamed his officials, and refused to apologize.

Nor were Mr. Trudeau’s human props actual actors with political science degrees like the once and future roughneck trotted out by one of the multitude of Conservative support groups not so long ago – although, that’s not to say no one in the group with the PM had a university degree, of course.


Alberta Opposition Leader Rachel Notley, also the former premier of Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Meanwhile, as Canadian Conservatives were reacting with weirdly hysterical fury to Mr. Trudeau’s newser, Mr. Kenney was doing essentially the same thing to better reviews from the trained seals in mainstream media.

The same day as Mr. Trudeau was in town, Mr. Kenney was announcing a meaningless “bold step to increase free trade in Canada” by dropping half of the province’s exceptions to the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement, a bit of neoliberal inter-provincial folderol cooked up by the usual suspects in 2017.

This was done, I guess, to show that a Conservative federal government would make Canada more prosperous by discouraging provincial public sectors from supporting local businesses. How making sure big corporations in other provinces can shove aside local suppliers is supposed to support hard pressed regional economies is not entirely clear, despite the market fundamentalist dogma nowadays pretty well universally accepted as gospel among Canadian political parties.


Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As an aside, it’s important to note that most of the exceptions on the list were demanded by Rachel Notley, then the NDP premier of Alberta, to ensure profits from rebuilding Fort McMurray after the devastating fire in 2016 weren’t pocketed by companies from outside the community. Many had been recommended to her by then Opposition leader Brian Jean, the Wildrose MLA for Fort McMurray-Conklin, to protect his community.

So it’s interesting that Mr. Kenney is willing to toss these useful tools over the side for meaningless symbolism without much thought to future disasters to which his government’s climate policies may well contribute.

Regardless, on the list of restrictions “unilaterally” dropped by the United Conservative Government was “procurement of local food under the Supporting Alberta’s Local Food Sector Act.”


Former Wildrose Party Opposition leader Brian Jean (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Now, the Supporting Alberta’s Local Food Sector Act is a somewhat misnamed bit of NDP legislation passed last year, mainly concerned with ensuring food sold in local markets as organically grown is accurately described as such.

Still, there’s something mildly ironic about the idea of unilaterally ensuring that a legislative effort to support local farmers no longer excludes farmers from other provinces!

Lending even more cognitive dissonance to this posturing was the fact, only a week earlier, that Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen was imploring us to “buy Albertan” to save farmers “caught in the crossfire of a bunch of international fights that have nothing to do with them.”

“Everyone can do their part and help our farmers by buying Albertan,” the MAGA-cap minister pleaded.

I suspect most Albertans will do exactly as Mr. Dreeshen’s boss is encouraging government officials to do, to wit, look for the best price, regardless of where it comes from.

Of course, a certain amount of policy incoherence from Premier Kenney is not entirely unexpected, as we Albertans are coming to learn.

An appropriate response, however, is one of genial contempt, not the seething fury that greeted Prime Minister Trudeau’s newser.

We can only speculate on why this might be, but it suggests that Canada’s Conservatives, having talked themselves into the idea they’re a deadbolt cinch to win the next federal election, are starting to realize that thanks in part to friends like Mr. Kenney and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Andrew Scheer’s coronation as prime minister in October may not be the sure thing they’d imagined","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

He could help Alberta farmers by enticing Bernard the Roughneck back from Stratford or wherever he’s doing his thespian thing and the pair of them could stuff their faces with high quality Taber corn. Sun photogs would love it.

The last time I saw Mr Hancock, it was April, a couple of days after the election; he was walking alongside Resources Road in Grande Prairie, collecting his election signs. I also had the opportunity to chat briefly with him during the campaign, at an all-candidates forum. He was far more rational than he has been given credit for, although I would never in a million years vote for him.

Great article, David; I really enjoyed reading it! I think the frustration of having a few days of silence imposed on you showed with your real vitriol.

I also enjoyed reading the National Post story of an event I had long forgotten about, Kenney’s fake citizenship ceremony. No doubt the Post also enjoyed exposing its then-rival Sun’s hoax. Sadly, I suspect we wouldn’t read about such an event in the Post today, as they would be in on it.

Meanwhile, in an issue of the Edmonton Journal last week they ran full page ads on the front page of an inside section telling us how trustworthy they are, at a time I find the paper the exact opposite.

All of those so-called “interprovincial trade barriers” are, in one form or another, simply evidence of something else conservative politicians of previous generations have long held dear: provinces exercising their authority in matters of exclusive Constitutional jurisdiction. Provinces and territories have the right to govern certain aspects of public policy within their borders, and in doing so to respond to the needs and wants of their voters and not necessarily to those of voters elsewhere. So, for example, there are the concerns that have been expressed in the past by the Government of Nunavut about liberalization of cross-boundary trade in alcoholic beverages, when that government feels the need to keep it under tight control as a major drug of abuse in their territory.
While I enjoy a beer now & then, and am particularly partial to local craft beers rather than the major national brands, I also know that alcohol is highly addictive and a serious contributor to a number of deadly and costly health problems in the population. So, we ought not, as a country, be treating interprovincial trade in alcohol just like any other product in the marketplace. There are legitimate public health interests in regulating it, as has been recognized by the Supreme Court in the famous “free the beer” case.
Of course, I do feel that if a province is maintaining non-tariff trade barriers for other reasons, like maintaining the guaranteed revenue stream of a retail monopoly in beer, wine & spirits, there may be room for some liberalization, but it is essential that we tread carefully to ensure provincial and territorial governments retain unfettered authority to act in the public interest within their exclusive jurisdiction.

The Conservative rage machine has been going full tilt in Alberta for some time, the main goal was to help get the UCP elected here, which it accomplished. It will not be as effective Federally as there are not too many more seats they can win here, but I am guessing it is quite good for their fundraising to continue to whip up anger against the Federal Liberals. Of course, now that they no longer have the provincial NDP to blame for the state of the economy, they also need to have someone else to demonize so Kenney and the UCP will remain blameless in case the miraculous economy recovery he talked about in the election does not magically happen.

It’s not too hard to demonize the Federal Liberals, especially when led by someone named Trudeau, here in Alberta, but unfortunately Mr. Trudeau is not playing along and making it easy for them. First, he went out and bought a pipeline, kind of an odd thing to do if he is as anti oil as the Conservatives portray him. Their answer is yah, but he secretly doesn’t really want to build it. Well that sort of worked when construction was held up (not by Trudeau, but by the courts), but now that has resumed, so they are now have to find other things to criticize – he didn’t go to the Stampede. Well, then he showed up there the other day so their answer was, yah, but he didn’t sit in the grandstand this time, as if this was some great offense or insult to Calgary.

The Federal Conservatives could probably change their name to the Yah, but party however all this yah butting, is not a good sign for them. The Conservatives are getting angrier and angrier because Trudeau isn’t playing along very well with their little game to demonize him. It probably wont affect the election outcome too much in Alberta, which is reliably blue Federally anyways, but I think they can already sense power slipping away from the grasp of Andrew Scheer. I can already anticipate their quiet thinking – yah but, next time we’ll get Jason Kenney for Federal leader and he will do much better.

Take Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party Government in the context of this sensible and widely held rule of thumb.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The Kenney cabinet could almost get away with insisting there’s a sinister conspiracy involving sinister American oilmen and equally sinister American environmental foundations to pay Canadian environmentalists to cook up defamatory disinformation about Alberta’s oilpatch. (All part of a scheme to deny foreign markets to Alberta’s bitumen, ya see, thereby land-locking the stuff to their own profitable benefit!)

Never mind there’s precious little evidence to support this complicated explanation for the success of the very real domestic and international opposition to further development of Alberta’s vast but problematic oilsands resource.

Even if you accept the conspiracy theory, after all, it’s hard to dispute the facts the tarry (sorry!) gunk from northern Alberta requires plenty of energy to process, thereby putting lots of carbon into the atmosphere of a planet that by scientific consensus is rapidly heating up, and that in turn results in a low-quality, low-value product that entails a considerable pollution risk when shipped.


Finance Minister Travis Toews (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Still, most of us understand that yelling about foreign-funded activists is a great way to back-foot your domestic opposition in a world grown nervous about foreign interference, not to mention to distract the rubes in your support base from what you’re about to do to them. So some of us might be willing to laugh this off as an exercise in cynical politics, even if it seems eccentric, and its $2.5-million-plus price tag a mite excessive.

This would probably be true even though much of the research underlying this fantastic interpretation of the facts is the work of a blogger with a background in an unrelated field reported to be none too clear about the sources of some of her own funding. After all, Premier Kenney himself, Energy Minister Sonya Savage, and Finance Minister Travis Toews have all lent their considerable prestige and credibility to these claims.

Indeed, this would likely be true even if the terms of reference of the inquiry hadn’t been quietly revised to switch the main suspects from sinister Americans to sinister Russians.


Energy Minister Sonya Savage (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But introduce another, completely different, sinister conspiracy theory into all this sinister theorizing, and, as they say, Houston, we’ve got a problem! (And that’s not a reference to the problem Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. was having unloading that pipeline before Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government took it off the Texas corporation’s hands for a cool $4.5 billion.)

I speak, of course, of Jason Luan, Jason Kenney’s junior minister of mental health and addictions, who blundered onto the provincial stage this week with a completely new and different sinister conspiracy theory.

To charitably describe the predicament in which Mr. Luan found himself, he had been stuck with the job of trying to explain the Kenney Government’s mean-spirited approach to harm-reduction strategies for dealing with the opioid crisis. For background, the Kenney Government’s view of safe-injection clinics sounds a lot like the late Harper Government’s approach to the same thing.

Mr. Luan was apparently trying to explain the UCP’s resistance to a medical consensus on harm reduction in reasonable terms when he asked in a vaguely Trump-toned tweet, “How much of the so called ‘evidence based research’ is funded by the multi billion dollar Pharma industry? Full disclosure is needed.”


UBC Medicine Professor Ryan McNeil (Photo: Simon Fraser University).

The reaction was not very sympathetic, all the more so when the tweet quickly disappeared from Twitter. (As should be expected, it turned out there were many screenshots.)

Mr. Luan probably didn’t help himself by harshly telling a Postmedia columnist that supervised injection clinics merely “keep them alive by feeding the disease and not addressing it. Yes, you can keep them alive one more day but you’re not going to save them. They’re going to die the minute you’re not with them.”

Well, you can argue politely about whether life-saving harm reduction or long-term detox programs should be a government’s priority. “He is either not engaging with the evidence in good faith or is ill equipped to actually evaluate the evidence,” is the way University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine Professor Ryan McNeil put it.

“Either of those things should be disqualifying from his position as the associate minister of mental health and addictions,” Dr. McNeil told the CBC.

Still, it was Mr. Luan’s conspiracy theory that really grabbed the attention.

“To raise the spectre of pharmaceutical company interference in this is laughably absurd, especially in the middle of a crisis,” observed Dr. McNeil, who is also associated with the B.C. Centre on Substance Use.Others were less kindly, dismissing Mr. Luan’s musings as, for example, “a wackadoo conspiracy theory.”

UCP Caucus staff will probably give Mr. Luan a stern lecture about ignoring his talking points, hand control of his Twitter account to a grownup, and try to pretend the tweet never happened.

Somebody in the UCP strategic brain trust must know the best way to do this politics stuff is one crazy conspiracy theory at a time.

But if they double down and announce another inquiry, this time into foreign pharma funding of fake research to sell Naloxone kits, we’ll know they’ve gone over the edge","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Nice try, but really, boldly arguing that the Kenny UCP will switch to a common sense approach while not being swayed by all that lousy evidence and academic research. This is the gang that can’t believe that somewhere, some hard working people are working hard, and that deservesrespect.

The new hot government model is do what makes your base get feels. Image below: Stephen Harper (top) being carried by Jason Kenny.

The CBC story shows the entire tweet. The irony is, Mr. Luan started off making, or at least alluding to, a very valid point, which is balancing society’s need for supervised injection sites with residents not wanting one in their neighbourhood. Too bad for him he then shot himself in the foot.

I’ll see your conspiracy theory and raise you another steaming hot mess.

As UCP conspiracy theories continue to abound, it reminds me of the less-than-stellar administration south of the border. Witch hunts conjured up by Donald Trump and his obsequious coven of political minions seems to rule the day in Trumpland. Importing American know-how on how to implement conspiracy theories is not exactly what voters likely had in mind when they handed to keys to the Legislature to this rebranded iteration of conservative misfits. They really do need to be better.

Remind that the Big Pharma opioid conspiracy enjoys the cognitive bias of availability. Everybody’s trying to get onto the bandwagon these days: evil Big Pharma has been allegedly making a lot of money from the opioid epidemic —or “crisis,” as it’s now inaccurate to called it—the normalized spate of fatal overdoses caused by super-potent fentanyl manufactured and distributed entirely by criminal organizations. Ignoring that Big Pharma does’nt profit from the manufacture and distribution of illegally-made fentanyl, state and federal and, now, provincial governments want some of Big Pharma’s astounding profits, anyway.

Canadian governments have been climbing up on the bandwagon, too—maybe twenty years late but, hey, this is Canada the Good where we don’t litigate near so much as our American neighbours. Just a couple years ago Nova Scotia joined a class action against Perdue Pharma, the New England company that lied to US federal regulators about its new OxyContin opioid not being addictive in order to get it licensed and making money; more recently the new government of BC announced it would be suing Big Pharma for “aggressively marketing” licensed opioids because, the Crown argues, it caused the illegally-made fentanyl “crisis” that has killed thousands of British Columbians over the past few years. How Big Pharma, as disingenuous as it’s been shown in many ways, is connected to organized crime which makes and peddles illegal fentanyl and has no inclination to share any of its own profits (said to be 20-fold more than achievable by peddling traditional, poppy-derived heroin) is something that requires all the unlikeliness of conspiracy theory as it’s popularly conceived: the more obtuse the better.

Indeed, any attempt to float the notion that a Canadian government can succeed in such a lawsuit requires the confusion of more than one conspiracy theory to be judged plausible instead of merely imitative or politically fashionable. As fatalities would have it, just such a confusion is available and has been since the original OxyContin fraud of 1996.

That Perdue Pharma conspired to lie about its new product’s addictiveness in order to profit more is a theory so evident that the company has paid over a billion dollars in fines and US court settlements. Many US and Canadian doctors overprescribed OxyContin on this vested interest’s false claim; although their professional lapse was probably less conspiratorial in and of itself, it was eventually augmented by a more deliberate conspiracy when physicians’ colleges rationalized an across-the-board policy of “cracking down” on opioid prescription in order to dodge culpability in their members’ patently unprofessional prescribing and neglecting to monitor plain symptoms of addictive behaviour in their patients. To pull this off required yet another conspiracy, one that emphasized Perdue’s own culpability and absolved doctors’, one that also had to blame patients instead as liars and drug-seekers, and opioids themselves which were alleged to be too addictive to safely prescribe for anything except the most severe pain caused by “terminal” illness: that is, patients were alleged to have somehow conspired to “force” supposedly reluctant doctors to prescribe them their dope and doctors only succumbed to the “political pressure.” All by conspiratorial necessity.

As with the fractal nature of lying to explain previous lies, conspiracy theories require adding more obtuse conspiracies to explain more-byzantine conspiracies. As such, patients had to be also blamed for diverting their prescribed opioids onto the streets in order, so the theory goes, to get money to purchase opioids sold illicitly on the streets, in spite of the obvious dangers, and that some of the opioids marketed on the streets were the very same prescribed opioids allegedly diverted by these supposedly dishonest patients. Unfortunately for the theorists, virtually all prescription lookalikes seized on Canadian streets by police have proved to be counterfeits laced with illegally-made fentanyl, not diverted prescriptions as the colleges had premised.

Plaintiffs never want to be accused of conspiracy, rather they want to show how they’ve been conspired against. The colleges’ hand-picked witnesses typically supplied anecdotes that they got hooked after being prescribed opioids for a “sports injury,” implausibly an athlete going directly from, say, T-3s to abjectly injecting illicit street heroin (now laced with deadly, illegally-made fentanyl). Short of hard data to substantiate this theoretical over-generality, the colleges omitted that any of these witnesses naturally try to shift blame away from themselves. (In fact, nobody has ever shown that 95% of patients don’t safely benefit from opioid prescription, nor that they get addicted or divert their meds onto the streets or would ever go there to get opioids refused them by doctors.) A collision of theories was necessary if doctors were to claim victimization by Big Pharma and absolve themselves from culpability overprescribing while submitting testimonials of similar but leap-frogged victimhood from users who were actually most likely to blame for their own addiction to street drugs. Good thing everyone expects conspiracy theories to be a bit fantastic—everyone except users overdosing on illegally-made fentanyl and legitimate patients hurt by the unwarranted crackdown.

Criss-crossing conspiracy theories are still in effect today. One type is American: police seizures of street drugs regularly confirm legitimately manufactured opioids are finding their way onto the streets sparking class action lawsuits against manufacturers like Perdue which state prosecutors allege should have and probably did suspect wholesale shipments of OxyContin are far in excess of normal medical need. Donald tRump has latched onto the lawsuit bandwagon to address the opioid overdose epidemic in his country —and to look like he’s actually doing something other than bullshitting all the time. The theory is that Big Pharma is knowingly trying to addict American patients in order to sell more product. BC Premier John Horgan’s lawsuit against Big Pharma’s Canadian subsidiaries is similar and must also be politically motivated because the basic accusation doesn’t stand up very well when the theory is tested: unlike in the USA, the amount of diverted prescriptions found on Canadian streets is vanishingly small and, after all, an arbitrary crackdown on opioid prescription had been in effect for two years by the time Horgan instructed his AG to file papers with the courts, proving the crackdown had made not one dint in the overdose epidemic and thence diminishing the argument that prescriptions are significantly correlated to use of street drugs (the crackdown did harm legitimate patients who were caught up in this game). the BC College’s crackdown has since been rescinded with the additional proviso that doctors may not drop patients from their practices simply to avoid prescribing opioid medicine they need as they had started to do when the crackdown was implemented.

The point is, Horgan is trying to cross one conspiracy—the uniquely American one—with another—the Canadian one that alleges the majority of users of street opioids, the principal victims of illegally-made fentanyl, initially became addicted by way of overprescription, therefore Big Pharma is culpable even though it’s always been a doctor’s responsibility to observe longstanding protocols for safely prescribing opioids. The suit, I guess, claims advertising by manufacturers like Perdue somehow illegally induced doctors to break their own medical standards. In any case, BC wants to recover expenses it has incurred dealing with the overdoes epidemic. No conspiracy yet to make clean, safe opioid prescription available to users so they don’t have to risk all by using fentanyl-contaminated dope (more than a theory, this approach is working in their jurisdictions).

Unfortunately, Horgan’s pursuit of Big Pharma opioid profits is delaying better ways to deal with the ongoing epidemic which kills street-drug users every single day in BC, despite the lawsuit’s prospects—which are very poor and far off, anyways. It’s a political posture that buys his government time (court cases involving conspiracy take a long time—longer when more than one need sorting out) while street users are expending all of their own mortal coils on a never-ending supply of cheap, potent and deadly fentanyl.

One can’t really blame Alberta’s Minister of Addictions for confusing conspiracy theories too: everybody’s doing it when it comes to who’s responsible for starting and for ending the overdose epidemic. And it’s hard not to get caught up in the chain-reaction of fissionable conspiracies theorized. Some would have Horgan protecting a powerful professional lobby by initiating his lawsuit in a diversionary way, as moot as it is. Others rather subscribe to the theory that doctors’ colleges fomented a diversionary fentanyl crisis when they realized the jig was up with regard their own neglect of professional protocols and dragging them into the same spotlight as the lying, profiteering Big Pharma in the wake of the OxyContin fiasco. After all, the Canadian colleges’ unwarranted crackdown was implemented only when the first Canadian class action against Perdue was filed inNova Scotia—about two decades after Americans had been suing the pants off of Perdue as it continued to reap obscenely huge profits from the very drug which started the whole mess in the first place. The dodges always needed some kind of a crisis to be at all plausible—such as it was, anyways.

See? It’s so easy even a rookie minister can do it!

It’s unfortunate that the religious right from Red Deer and south (see college just north of Red Deer) have convinced those Calgary and south Calgary voters to vote UCP. Just waiting how this will all play out with the natural gas corporations already asking UCP to help them. Most don’t remember how Ralph (RIP) balanced the budget, not on wise government decision but natural gas price was at $13.00 and now at $2.40 (and at that time he lowered and removed the oil royalty rates). UCP needs to explain how lowering the corporate income tax will balance the budget. Corporates will invest anyplace where money can be made. When the NDP won government one of the most prominent Chinese investors was interviewed shorty after and he said no problem, we deal with all sorts of governments all over the world, communist, dictatorships , etc. Now UCP wants to blame the NDP and have delayed doing a budget. The last NDP budget seems to be doing Alberta fine. Calgary and south could never accept a leader from the Edmonton region and now they should pay for electing an incompetent UCP party.

If Mr. Kenney can return Alberta’s economy to good times in the next two or three years and rein in the deficit without too much cuts to education, health care and other government services, Albertans will not mind a few kooks in his cabinet. After all the Socreds ran this place for years and they had more than their share of kooks. As long as things ran smoothly Albertans did not mind so much at least until the govermnent started to seem too old, tired and out of step with the times.

However, if Kenney can’t do these things, he need only look at Doug Ford’s Ontario budget to see how quickly and dramatically the nice honeymoon can end.

I suspect Kenney will be off to a different more high profile political position in a few years or less, so how much kookiness the UCP has may not matter to him personally. I think after the Federal election it will be clear to Conservatives that Scheer is not the winner they’d hoped for and they will be looking for someone with a better track record of winning elections. Then the UCP without its dear leader may face the same fate as the Socreds after their successful leader left, especially if most of their kooks stay here and don’t follow Kenney back to Ottawa.

Every time another UCP Caucus member is interviewed by the Mounties, the party or the MLA in question issues a statement stating that the he or she is not under investigation.

This begs an obvious question: Who is?

Someone must be, else the national police force, facing budget restrictions like everyone else nowadays, wouldn’t be investigating, would they?

Much has been made of the fact this continuing police investigation doesn’t appear to have made a dent on public approval of Mr. Kenney’s UCP government, elected in April. True enough, but this ought not really to be a surprise. It will only be when the $64,000 Question is answered that most voters will decide whether it should have an impact on how they view the governing party.

In the mean time, without additional information, it would hardly be fair to draw a connection between whatever is being investigated by the Mounties and Mr. Kenney’s victory or the loss of his principal rival, former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean.


Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Regardless, it seems as if it would be a good idea from the UCP’s perspective either to get this over with immediately or try to stall it past the federal election this fall. Since they’ve heard the investigators’ questions, they’re bound to have a somewhat better idea than the rest of us of where this is headed.

Certainly they wouldn’t want a story that makes them look crooked to break just before the October election, in which all provincial Conservative governing parties appear to be toiling mightily to elect Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer as prime minister of Canada, giving them a crack at reopening the Canadian Constitution to their advantage.

Mr. Scheer is already having a problem living down the recent depredations of Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose Progressive Conservative government is on hiatus from governing in order to avoid further embarrassments blowing up their federal brethren’s campaign. (This has forced Mr. Scheer to come up with his own embarrassments, which doesn’t seem to have been a problem. Consider his declaration to a group of dairy farmers that Canada’s Food Guide is the product of liberal ideology, not science. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, perhaps the result of having Gerald Butts back on his campaign team, was pretty feisty in response.)


Culture Minister Leela Aheer (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The Mounties, meanwhile, with their Alberta investigation now overseen by an unnamed Ontario prosecutor, are moving at their own stately pace. Perhaps they’ll tip off the news media when its time for a raid, as they’ve been known to do in the past.

So far, they are known to have interviewed Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda, Culture Minister Leela Aheer, Seniors and Housing Minister Josephine Pon, Associate Mental Health and Addictions Minister Jason Luan, Cardston-Siksika MLA Joseph Schow, Sherwood Park MLA Jordan Walker and Calgary-East MLA Peter Singh. Mr. Singh’s Calgary auto body repair shop was also searched by police, who carted off computer equipment.


NDP Ethics Critic Heather Sweet (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the same time frame this story was unfolding, the Office of the Election Commissioner announced fines totalling $70,000 had been levied on former UCP leadership contender Jeff Callaway for two dozen campaign finance infractions.

So far, Commissioner Lorne Gibson’s staff has levied fines of $168,350, against various participants in Mr. Callaway’s “Kamikaze” campaign, so known because it was supposedly intended to sink Mr. Jean’s leadership hopes in a way that let Mr. Kenney keep his paws clean.

This led NDP Ethics Critic Heather Sweet last week to demand Premier Kenney throw Mr. Callaway and his campaign team out of the party. “The sheer scale of illegal behaviour inside the UCP is truly disgraceful, and it reveals a culture of corruption,” she stated.

Mr. Kenney denies any involvement.


Former Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen (Photo: IowaPolitics.com, Creative Commons).

As for Mr. Gibson, who was appointed by the NDP, the UCP are not fans. Doubtless Mr. Kenney would love to send him packing, if only he could think up with a decent excuse that didn’t make it look like he was trying to derail an ongoing investigation. It’s thought Mr. Gibson’s staff played a role in persuading the RCMP to launch its independent investigation, although exactly what the Mounties are investigating is not clear. Presumably they are interested in more serious infractions than violations of mere election finance regulations.

If anyone ends up being charged as a result of the Mounties’ inquiries — and there’s no way of knowing at this point if that will happen — it seems likely the UCP leadership will disavow them completely, a political phenomenon known as being tossed under the wheels of a bus.

With all this stuff swirling around, the recent example of Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, who sang like a canary in similar circumstances, must make the UCP and CPC strategic brain trusts as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. (No more cat-and-canary metaphors — Ed.)

<p class=""p1"">In the same time frame this story was unfolding, the Office of the Election Commissioner <a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/5654351/jeff-callaway-ucp-alberta-election-commissioner-fine/"">announced fines totalling $70,000</a> had been levied on former UCP leadership contender Jeff Callaway for two dozen campaign finance infractions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So far, Commissioner Lorne Gibson’s staff has levied fines of $168,350, against various participants in Mr. Callaway’s “Kamikaze” campaign, so known because it was supposedly intended to sink Mr. Jean’s leadership hopes in a way that let Mr. Kenney keep his paws clean.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This led NDP Ethics Critic Heather Sweet last week to demand Premier Kenney throw Mr. Callaway and his campaign team out of the party. “The sheer scale of illegal behaviour inside the UCP is truly disgraceful, and it reveals a culture of corruption,” she stated.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Kenney denies any involvement.</p>

<p class=""p1"">As for Mr. Gibson, who was appointed by the NDP, the UCP are not fans. Doubtless Mr. Kenney would love to send him packing, if only he could think up with a decent excuse that didn’t make it look like he was trying to derail an ongoing investigation. It’s thought Mr. Gibson’s staff played a role in persuading the RCMP to launch its independent investigation, although exactly what the Mounties are investigating is not clear. Presumably they are interested in more serious infractions than violations of mere election finance regulations.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If anyone ends up being charged as a result of the Mounties’ inquiries — and there’s no way of knowing at this point if that will happen — it seems likely the UCP leadership will disavow them completely, a political phenomenon known as being tossed under the wheels of a bus.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With all this stuff swirling around, the recent example of Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, who <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1152316484154249216"">sang like a canary</a> in similar circumstances, must make the UCP and CPC strategic brain trusts as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. (<i>No more cat-and-canary metaphors</i> — Ed.)</p>

Will someone, or some organization, be providing the funds for these fines to be paid? My guess is that is how the silence will be acquired.

“Canada’s Food Guide is the product of liberal ideology, not science.”

Stephen Harper muzzled climate scientists – will Andrew Scheer muzzle food scientists?

That pesky science stuff is such an irritant to conservatives. No wonder they want to encourage young people to go into the trades.

There is a real probability that Kenney is the premier by virtue of a corrupt process…a really corrupt process. What is the end game is the investigations find that is the case? Can he be removed from office?

You’d have to be pretty, pretty naïve as a voter not to see the links to the Jason Kenney and the Jeff Callaway campaigns.

Voters who actually drill down will uncover a plethora of sordid evidence that points to a Kenney/Callaway conspiracy to deny Brian Jean the UCP leadership — UCP denials notwithstanding. Let’s hope the RCMP cracks the case soon. If I hear no collusion and no obstruction one more time from any politician, I’m going to start screaming into a brown paper bag.

While I think that the NDP is right to pursue this scandal, I hope that they don’t make the mistake that many fear that the Democrats are making in pitting their hopes of Russiagate to bring down the Republicans. While character and ethics are important, it is clear that most people don’t vote on these issues alone. If that were the case, the fortunes of Rachel Notley and Hillary Clinton would be very different. I think that they need to work on opposing the policies of Jason Kenney and work to build public support for their alternatives.

“Canada’s national police” … true, technically, but (no doubt unintentionally) somewhat misleading and incomplete. Remember, that in 7½ of Canada’s provinces—i.e. everywhere except Ontario, Quebec & those parts of Newfoundland & Labrador policed by the RNC—the RCMP has essentially been contracted by the provincial government to serve as the provincial police force, to police those parts of those provinces that do not have their own municipal police forces. As such, they are answerable to and funded by the provinces’ Solicitors-General, and not really to the federal government in Ottawa. Their jurisdiction in the provinces where they are so employed extends not only to investigating alleged Criminal Code offences, but to matters that involve purely provincial laws, from liquor control and gaming regulations to election laws.

So, just because the RCMP is investigating this affair, does not ipso facto mean that there must be some criminal offence at the root of the matter.

127,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Why are Conservative-run Canadian provinces turning down federal cash? The answer’s in the Republican playbook,2019-07-22 01:49:00,David Climenhaga,,"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau observed back on April 16 that the Ontario provincial government led by Premier Doug Ford was throwing roadblocks in the way of Ontario municipalities accessing federal money for needed transportation infrastructure, Conservatives responded with angry denials, and not just in Ontario.

The prime minister had told a news conference Kitchener, Ont., that over the previous year Mr. Ford’s Conservative government hadn’t approved a single infrastructure project for which federal funds were available. Mr. Trudeau called this an example of Mr. Ford’s government “letting down Ontarians.”

Ontario Infrastructure Minister Monte McNaughton characterized the PM’s comment as “a desperate attempt to change the channel,” a phrase that was quickly picked up and repeated by Conservative echo chambers in media and on social media.

But surely this little blip on the political radar, soon forgotten in the news coverage of the Alberta general election results that evening, from which Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party emerged triumphant, seems more credible in light of recent revelations.


Ontario Premier Doug Ford (Photo: Twitter).

I speak, of course, of the news last week that Manitoba’s Conservative provincial government has also refused to accept an offer from Ottawa to provide $5 million in federal carbon tax funds to finance green enhancements at elementary and secondary schools. The sum may be small, but, as they say, it’s not the lousy five million bucks, it’s the principle of the thing.

The offer was part of a broader federal program to use money from Ottawa’s carbon tax to upgrade schools in the four Conservative-run provinces that refused to introduce their own carbon-pricing systems and therefore fell under the federal carbon tax legislation, against which Andrew Scheer’s federal Conservatives have chosen to campaign.

Manitoba’s seldom-seen Conservative Premier, Brian Pallister, dismissed the federal offer as “a hoax,” on the grounds “the feds want to have a PR campaign to promote the carbon tax and they’re on their own.”


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

While the logic of Mr. Pallister’s commentary may seem a little strained, as with Mr. Ford’s policy in Ontario the motive is not difficult to figure out.

As has been said here before, modern Canadian Conservatives don’t seem to have many ideas of their own, and take most of their strategies straight out of the Republican Party playbook south of the 49th Parallel.

As is well known, in the age of Donald Trump, American Republicans won’t do anything that might help their Democratic Party opponents, even if they have to hurt their own constituents to achieve that goal.

Consider the 14 Republican states that refuse to expand the U.S. federal Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, in large part because they don’t want to do anything for which Democrats could take credit, but also because they have a pathological hatred of the former president Barack Obama’s policies in general, and his health care reform in particular.

The growing rural health care crisis in the United States, New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman wrote in June, “is largely … a direct result of political decisions.”


Former U.S. president Barack Obama (Photo: Pete Souza, the White House).

“The simple fact is that the Republicans who run Tennessee and other ‘non-expansion’ states have chosen to inflict misery on many of their constituents, rural residents in particular,” Dr. Krugman wrote.

“Rural voters often complain that national elites don’t care about their needs,” he explained. “Well, one way to make people feel hostile toward those elites is to block their access to federal benefits, and hope they don’t realize who’s actually causing their misery.”

Don’t think for a moment the same cynical calculation isn’t on Conservative minds in this country, especially with a federal election campaign under way, the economy in pretty good shape, and a Liberal government in Ottawa.

It will be no surprise to see Ontario, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan also turn down similar federal offers. As will Jason Kenney’s Alberta too, one imagines, now that it’s in the process of joining the self-styled “resistance” to carbon pricing.

After all, as has been noted here before, carbon taxes are the Obamacare of Canada, an idea invented by the political right, then cynically abandoned and misrepresented when more centrist parties like the Liberals and Alberta’s NDP adopted and implemented it","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

126,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Irony is dead but doublethink thrives as Calgary opts to cut services and subsidize hockey billionaires at once,2019-07-23 01:31:00,David Climenhaga,,"Really, what can one say about the deal the City of Calgary struck with the Flames professional hockey club yesterday for the former Cowtown’s taxpayers to subsidize half the cost of a new arena for the team to the tune of $225 million at the same moment as this city slashes $60 million from its budgets for fire, transit, affordable housing and police services?

I mean, other than, “What the actual (EXPLETIVE DELETED)” — which is, in fact, what a lot of people were saying on social media yesterday.


Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The message from the city is now simultaneously, “we’re broke — dontcha know? — sacrifices must be made,” and “this arena is a great deal for the city!”

To acknowledge that the optics of this are bad, as an embarrassed-sounding Mayor Naheed Nenshi did at an evening news conference, is to understate things considerably. “The optics of this stink, this is really terrible timing,” he said. “But if the deal is ready to go, I’m not about to hold it back.”

City Councillor Jeff Davison — who represents well-heeled west-side neighbourhoods and campaigned on his “pro-business attitude” — got closer to what I imagine council is actually thinking when he blew off concerns about the cuts by saying, sure, “the timing is not ideal. We know there’s a lot of things going on with respect to the budget. But when you really look at $60 million worth of cuts, that’s really talking about two to three per cent of our operational budget. The sky’s not going to fall for two to three per cent.” (Emphasis added.)


Calgary Ward 6 Councillor Jeff Davison (Photo: jeffdavisonyyc.com).

In other words, we don’t really care about the optics, the Flames’ billionaire owners want a new arena and by gosh we’re going to give it to them. People who want transit or quick response times from emergency services in their déclassé east-side suburbs can pound sand.

Calgarians will have a week to contribute their two-cents worth on this, which I’m sure will be considered thoughtfully by council. So if they have anything to say, they’d better get crackin’.

After that, it seems likely the deal will be swiftly passed and everything will get back to normal, with municipal and provincial politicians from Calgary kvetching that we’re broke here in Alberta, and blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government for it. Albertans certainly shouldn’t look for critical comments about this deal from Premier Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party Calgary MLAs or any change in their poor-us rhetoric.


Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corp. Vice Chair Ken King (Photo: Rotary Club of Calgary).

That is to say, expect standard operating procedure, which in Calgary as elsewhere means irony is dead and doublethink is alive and well.

As for whether or not the new arena turns out to be a good deal for the city remains to be seen, but the auguries are not particularly promising.

The city manager’s report to council indicates “no time value of money accounted.” About which University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe tweeted: “OMFG!!!!!”

The city will own the building, while billionaire-heavy Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corp. will run it till it’s time for the city to tear down the wreck and pony up for a new one or see the team move to Seattle or Halifax.


University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe (Photo: Twitter).

Speaking of which, CSEC Vice-Chair Ken King thanked everyone for their excellent service, and, as the CBC’s reporter put it, “confirmed that the 35-year deal means the Flames won’t be going anywhere.” Mr. King is a former publisher of the Calgary Herald whose legacy lives on at the former newspaper of record, so don’t look for any incisive coverage of this deal there.

As for the supposed benefits of subsidies for professional sports teams, the consensus among economists seems to be that there aren’t very many. They rudely dismiss the inevitable promises of jobs and tourists as bogus.

Still, there are “intangible benefits.” In Edmonton, for example, heavily subsidized drugstore billionaire Daryl Katz appears to have quietly decamped for Vancouver, and thence to Los Angeles. “Go Oilers!”

Neither Calgary nor Alberta is broke, of course. The city could afford a new arena for the Flames and a decent transit system. But that would mean fair business taxes, not to mention a commitment to public services, and we know that’s not going to fly","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

David I was with you until the last paragraph when you talk about Calgary “fair business taxes”. I looked at an article by the Canadiam Federation of Independent Business on this topic. They were discussing the differential between the commercial and residential tax mill rate. In 2018 Calgary’s commercial mill rate was 4.14 that of residential, in Edmonton it was 2.82 and Lethbridge it was 2.36. If I look at those numbers it appears the issue isn’t the tax rate on business but that the property tax rate on homeowners needs to go up. In fact it looks like businesses are being overtaxed in Calgary compared to other cities. Enjoy your day.

Farmer Brian, I see you have not got out from under the dome yet. Calgary businesses and residences have received the biggest subsidies from any municipality in Alberta from past governments. Calgary is the same to Alberta as Quebec is to Canada. Anytime Calgary feels some pain they blame the rest of Alberta and Canada. I have lived in Calgary and dealt with governments on Calgary issues and all they end up doing is whining that everyone has done them wrong. Calgary chose to be a one economic industry and when it does not work they whine. Northern Alberta might be wise to separate from southern Alberta.

How shameful — more corporate welfare!!

Those who regularly condemn democratic socialists with their hair-on-fire diatribes over at the Postmedia franchises are eerily silent in their condemnation these days over this corporate giveaway for billionaires. As far as the socialist-eating head honchos over at the UCP rage machine goes, Climenhaga is spot on when he points out the outrageous doublethink associated with our new politically ordained masters of the Legislature.

Gullible voters who continue to be hoodwinked by right-wing political parties and politicians preaching government austerity at any cost, once again just got taken to the woodshed for a practical lesson in political double-cross and political doublespeak. Now that’s really shameful.

I suppose it was inevitable – Edmonton has a nice shiny new arena so Calgary would get one too. Unfortunately, Premier Redford did no favours in ruling out provincial money for Edmonton and the new provincial government doesn’t seem in a spending mood either. The city of Calgary will have to carry the financial can on this one at the same time as claiming to be broke and cutting services, talk about bad timing.

I suppose Mayor Nenshi is not planning on running again so may use whatever political capital he still has to move this forward. Unfortunately, its a bit late for him to jump into provincial politics or probably even Federal. Also, there is no cozy cabinet post possibly available in Edmonton, as there was for the last Calgary mayor who needed to escape the hangover of big projects.

I suspect the debate will be interesting and I am not sure the arena will even go ahead, the timing is particularly bad. Perhaps if things get desperate Calgary city council could take money from the Green Line and try re-allocate it to the arena. Oh wait that’s money from the carbon tax that no longer exists. Imaginary money for expensive projects, just another day in Alberta politics.

This is a completely unnecessary. if the owners won’t pay for the arena, we should not. There are a lot of economic studies which show that the benefits that arenas give to a city is far less than what the proponents claim it will bring. We need to contact our alderman and let them know our opposition to this proposal. There are many alderman who have said that they are undecided at this point and perhaps they can be convinced to vote no.

All Calgarians were just robbed. This is blatant and open theft of public funds. Enjoy your property tax hikes in the coming years as you cheer for the Flames.

Meanwhile, Who needs improved public transit? Who needs public school funding? Who needs timely police and fire rescue? Who among the 115 city staff members laid off needs a job? I guess the answer to those questions is no one.

Billionaires need money and their hockey palace so they can make even more money. Screw everyone else, eh?

“Why did the Trudeau Liberals give $2.5 million to a left-wing special interest group to attack our energy industry?” Premier Kenney screeched, linking to a freebie article handed over to the Toronto Sun by a couple of Canadian Taxpayers Federation agitators. The SSHRC, for some reason, is a particular bee in the CTF’s bonnet.

The CTF op-ed noted the academic study managed by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (and Edmonton’s Parkland Institute, it must also be noted) “lists about 100 people as advisors and collaborators, mostly from unions and academic institutions. (Full disclosure: I am one of those people, although I can’t recall at the moment if I’m a collaborator or an advisor.)

It should also be added that Mr. Kenney, a former CEO of the CTF, was a senior member of Mr. Harper’s cabinet when this deed was done, and Jack Mintz, the Harperites’ favourite economist, was vice-president and chair of the SSHRC’s governing council.

If you were thinking Mr. Harper and Dr. Mintz might now be called to account by Mr. Kenney’s War Room, don’t hold your breath. After a few hours, and several responses pointing out the embarrassing facts, Mr. Kenney’s tweet disappeared down the Memory Hole.

I was disappointed, of course, because over the past four years I have reported on at least three occasions on this blog that the SSHRC grant supporting a study exposing the fossil fuel industry to some much-needed sunlight was awarded while Mr. Harper was prime minister, a development that I observed when it happened with dumbfounded incredulity. My theory at the time was that some functionary in Mr. Harper’s office must have seen “corporate mapping project,” concluded, “that sounds like a good idea,” and read no further before stamping it “APPROVED!” Either that, or the SSHRC really is independent.

Regardless, this would appear to mean Mr. Kenney isn’t racing to read AlbertaPolitics.ca every morning before he flips open his copy of the more sympathetic National Post.

To be completely honest, given the great work the CMP has been doing, I am astounded it has taken this long for the CTF and their former CEO to start trying to discredit it.

Speaking of the CTF and Twitter, I was also astounded to read the tweet yesterday by the group’s federal director, Aaron Wudrick, in which he asked, “How bad is the Flames’ arena deal?” and answered, “So bad that I’m 100% with @djclimenhaga on this one.”

One problem with “war” rooms, is when the big weapons get in the hands of the clumsy or inept, they might shoot themselves in the foot instead or worse.

So if you happen to see the usually more sure footed Kenney limping around Edmonton a bit, or more likely just keeping a very low profile for a few days, you can bet he is licking his self inflicted wounds.

It is also one of the hazards when you start to believe your own side’s propaganda that everything you think is bad is Trudeau’s fault. Tweet first, think and regret later, at your own peril, even for the more normally adept rabid partisans like Mr. Kenney.

So it appears Kenney’s tweet was captured on the Global “news” site, likely others as well. Now we wait for the rage machine to start the articles and tweets about Trudeau paying off the media with tax dollars for better coverage. I don’t think Kenney is smart enough to plan this but watch the spin.

I imagine there were heated words spoken about Mr. Justice Eric Macklin’s decision just before the close of business yesterday to grant the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees an interim injunction suspending application of Bill 9, the Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act, until the union’s challenge of the law’s constitutionality can run its course.


UCP Finance Minister Travis Toews (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

This was not an outcome that could have been predicted with a high degree of certainty, and it leaves the government of Premier Jason Kenney with egg on its face.

AUPE was justified to hail its courtroom success as “a fundamental victory for all workers in Alberta.” Said AUPE President Guy Smith in a news release last night: “Justice Macklin also agreed with AUPE that the public has a real interest in ensuring that all parities, including the government, comply with their contractual obligations.”

It’s hard to imagine the UCP is the sort of organization that reacts to such developments with equanimity.

Still, for the time being, yesterday’s decision by a justice of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench leaves the Kenney Government in a difficult position, as well as an embarrassing one.


Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andre Forget, Andrew Scheer/Flickr).

As has been argued here before, the principal purpose of Bill 9, which allowed the government to break terms and conditions of legal contracts negotiated in good faith by delaying wage arbitrations until after the October federal election, was simplyto prevent arbitrators giving public employees like nurses a raise. Potentially, up to 180,000 public-sector workers could have been impacted.

The urgency for a government that had already decided to attack public-sector salaries was that many Alberta public employees’ unions negotiated “wage reopener” agreements in their current contracts, which have now reached the point these wages-only negotiations were about to start or were already underway.

Typically, if parties to a wage-reopener can’t reach agreement in collective bargaining, compulsory binding arbitration is triggered. Both AUPE and United Nurses of Alberta, an intervenor in the case, had already reached that place in their negotiations when Bill 9 was passed and proclaimed into law in June.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: Alberta Premier Jason Kenney).

The UCP must have thought it was being devilishly clever when it derailed that process with Bill 9, arguing unconvincingly this was just a procedural delay while its recently appointed “blue-ribbon” panel got a handle on the province’s finances. Union members suspected there was no mystery about what the panel headed by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon would recommend based on what she has done and written in the past.

Now that strategy doesn’t look so clever, especially in light of Mr. Justice Macklin’s commentary, which to this legal layperson’s reading doesn’t indicate a lot of confidence in either the government’s good intentions or its respect for fundamental rights.

“Members of the public expect that parties to an agreement will honour commitments made in agreements, and they reasonably expect that parties with whom they contract, regardless of who that may be, will honour the terms of the agreement made,” he said, noting this is true even when one of the parties is a government.


“Blue-Ribbon Panel” Chair Janice MacKinnon (Photo: C.D. Howe Institute).

“It is in the long-term public interest for the public to see that its government cannot unilaterally change its contractual obligations through legislation that may interfere with Charter rights,” he stated. This is a conclusion that suggests he thinks AUPE’s constitutional argument has merit.

That said, the ruling is not everything the union might have hoped for, including as it does “direction that any wage increases awarded through the interest arbitration shall be held in abeyance until this claim is finally determined.”

Still, in the short term, this doesn’t leave the government a lot of palatable options if it doesn’t want to upset federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s rickety applecart before Oct. 21, when the next federal election is to be held.

Like Doug Ford’s calamitous government in Ontario, UCP leaders don’t have much choice but to behave — which must go against their instincts.

They can appeal the ruling, as Finance Minister Travis Toews has already vowed to do. This might succeed, but it seems likely Mr. Justice Macklin, aware of this possibility, has crossed his t’s and dotted his i’s with care.

They could recall the Legislature and invoke the Constitution’s Notwithstanding Clause, but that would bring the wrath of voters outside the Prairies crashing down on Mr. Scheer’s head.

Or they can grind their teeth and plot their next move, after the federal election season has passed. In the mean time, it will be interesting to see how they try to prevent arbitrators from doing their jobs.

<p class=""p1"">“It is in the long-term public interest for the public to see that its government cannot unilaterally change its contractual obligations through legislation that may interfere with Charter rights,” he stated.

I wonder if Jason Kenney would have less contempt for workers if he had ever had to work at a minimum wage job. He has been living well off the taxpayer for his entire working life.

Remember that Kenney introduced the Bad Faith Bargaining Bill 9 during Public Service appreciation week. It is simply not possible to show more contempt for public servants than that.

What’s more damning?

I hope Canadians are waking up to the neo-right conundrum: if these usurpers of once-responsible conservative parties and sometime-governments were truthful about their real agenda to diminish our federation’s eleven sovereignties for the sake of stateless corporatism and private profiteering at the expense of our environment, hardly anybody would vote for them (hence the cagey platforms and stealthy mendacity). But surely it’s becoming more plain to more and more citizens now that Scheer’s federal neo-right party has been hurt by the agendas of the Alberta and Ontario conservative governments—to the extent that it’s crimping their style.

So what’s more damning? Andrew Scheer’s “rickety applecart” of disingenuousness rolling toward this fall’s federal election, or the fact that JKKK and/or D’ohFo have to sit on their hands, swallow their bile and whistle past the dog cemetery else realizations of their respective, disrespecting agendas doom their federal equivalent’s chances of winning in October? It’s that bad.

I’d say even a tie is at least damning for Scheer, almost certainly so for the D’ohFo, and who knows?—maybe one day, even for the Albertan pseudoCon.

All those new conservative governments are not doing so well in the courts – first the carbon tax in Saskatchewan and Ontario, now wage arbitration deferral in Alberta. I suspect they don’t want to hear this, but rule of law is a real thing, not just something to use against pesky pipeline protesters. It applies to governments too. In this case, it affirms that you can not just ignore or dismiss all the things you do not like or are not convenient for you by passing a law.

Yes, the new Alberta government probably needs some time to figure out how it is going to handle our financial situation. Although, it is not entirely a surprise – the deficit amount was known for a long time and the only surprise was it was actually quite a bit lower, so they didn’t inherit a bigger than expected mess. They actually got some much needed breathing room from the previous NDP government. In any event, it is no excuse to try delay dealing with wages for employees. Any government has to deal with a number of issues at the same time. If they can not walk and chew gum at the same time as the saying goes, then they are probably not up to really governing.

I suppose the UCP may refuse to gracefully accept defeat on this issue, much like it seems determined to plow on challenging the Federal carbon tax even despite several defeats already in other provinces. However, the risk is at some point this stubbornness may start to look like foolishness and all the legal costs associated with continuing to fight on these issues may also start to look wasteful to voters.

This would not be the first time that an anti-worker Alberta government has rested its fingers on the scales when public-sector wages, benefits & working conditions are on the line. I seem to recall a period back in the Getty-Klein era, when the PC government of the day brought in legislation requiring compulsory interest arbitration panels—which was then the only legal option available to a public-sector union facing an impasse at the bargaining table—to take into account “the fiscal situation of the government” (or words to that effect). Essentially, that legislation made public-sector workers individually responsible for the poor financial management of the government.

Should we expect similar legislation this fall? I wouldn’t bet against it. It seems every bad idea from the past keeps getting resurrected by the Kenney Government.

So condemning Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau for the $2.5-million federal grant for an academic study of concentrated power and influence in Canada’s fossil fuel industry was obviously too tempting to resist for Mr. Kenney or whoever does his tweeting for him, even though they ought to have known the grant by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada was approved on Conservative PM Harper’s watch.

Quietly deleting the tweet — “why did the Trudeau Liberals give $2.5 million to a left wing special interest group to attack our energy industry?” — without acknowledging the error or apologizing when it prompted a flurry of corrections on social media is pretty much standard operating procedure for Mr. Kenney’s party.

Mr. Kenney’s tweet included a link to an op-ed in a Postmedia newspaper written by a couple of Canadian Taxpayers Federation operatives, Franco Terrazzano and Kris Sims. The CTF and the Fraser Institute apparently nowadays comprise a significant part of the Kenney Government’s research department. The record of the CTF indicates the mysteriously funded anti-tax lobby group has long had a bee in its bonnet about the SSHRC.

In reality, given the way the federal social sciences and humanities research-funding agency has operated since the government of Pierre Trudeau created it in 1977, SSHRC grant recipients are chosen by panels of their academic peers, who volunteer their time. There is no political oversight, nor should there be. This has been true under all prime ministers, Liberal and Conservative, for the past 42 years.

In 2015, when the Corporate Mapping Project received the now controversial six-year grant, it was one of the top-rated proposals for research projects involving groups outside the academy among more than 100 applications for that kind of support from Canadian scholars, CMP Director Bill Carroll told me last week.

The outside groups involved in the project was the CTF’s objection, and apparently the basis of Mr. Kenney’s accusation, since one of them was the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a progressive think tank partly funded by union donations. The CTF also has many anti-union links.


Dr. Jack Mintz, University of Calgary economist and former president and chair of the SSHRC’s governing council (Photo: Imperial Oil).

By the time more-detailed proposals were submitted by short-listed research groups that year, the CMP had moved up to No. 1, recalled Dr. Carroll, a professor of sociology at the University of Victoria, the project’s sponsoring institution.

A key intention of the proposal and a key reason he believes it succeeded with the peer-review panel, Dr. Carroll noted, was that part of its concept was to dig out “knowledge of value to citizens in the democratic process” and then get “that analysis into the public sphere.”

That is why the proposal included research into key influencers in the fossil fuel industrial ecosystem, its intricately interlocked corporate directorships, and its international connections, he explained.

The CTF broadside will likely not be the last, or the most intemperate, attack on the CMP now that it has appeared on the radar of the political right. A response by the CMP reflects the views expressed by Dr. Carroll in our conversation.

Jack Mintz, the conservative University of Calgary economist who was vice-president and chair of the SSHRC’s governing council at the time the CMP grant was awarded, defends that approach to selecting grant recipients.

“It was never politically reviewed,” Dr. Mintz told me last week, arguing that SSHRC grants cannot be described as being approved by either Mr. Harper’s or Mr. Trudeau’s government, since the process is scrupulously independent. “I didn’t know anything about it until it did become public.”


An image of Mr. Kenney’s controversial July 24 tweet, since deleted from Twitter (Screenshot: Twitter).

That said, Dr. Mintz indicated he had reservations about the CMP project when he learned of it — “I have to admit, my eyebrow went up” — and wasn’t particularly pleased to be identified in a CMP database as one of the key influencers behind the fossil fuel industry.

“If I was so influential, I could have stopped the grant,” he said, adding quickly that he never raised the issue in council. “I didn’t think that would be appropriate.”

Still, Dr. Mintz worries the grant to this project sets a bad priority, and warns that “a grant like this could happen on the right.”

Well, perhaps. Many scholars believe the SSHRC program under which the CMP application was made was set up to encourage partnerships between universities and industry. In other words, you might argue, more to grease the wheels of capital accumulation than to benefit ordinary Canadians.

Nevertheless, it was open to more than one kind of non-academic partner, allowing SSHRC to fund at least one project that was intended to help encourage a more robust democracy.

The SSHRC says on its website it “remains committed to engaging its stakeholder communities and demonstrating that the research it supports leads to benefits for Canadians.”

The work it supports, it says, “spurs innovative researchers to learn from each other’s disciplines, delve into multiparty collaborations, and achieve common goals for the betterment of Canadian society. Research is shared with communities, businesses and governments, who use the new knowledge to innovate and improve people’s lives.”

By that definition, the CMP is not a bad precedent at all. Do you think we should give Mr. Harper some of the credit for it","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Dr. Adkin: For economy of words, I may have brushed too lightly over Dr. Mintz’s brief comments. From my notes: “When it got publicly announced, I have to admit, my eyebrow went up. I thought, gee, it’s almost like a witch hunt … to just identify corporations. … It does concern me. A grant like this could happen on the right. It kind of sets up a bad precedent.” I interpreted the latter point to mean he views the CMP as tendentious, and that the bad precedent would be a similarly tendentious right-wing project. My own view is that that almost any partnership between university researchers and the corporate sector is bound to be based to some degree on ideology and is likely to contain plenty of tendentious conclusions.

115,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"UCP Government, with no apparent short-term Plan B, seeks leave to appeal injunction suspending Bill 9",2019-08-02 01:29:00,David Climenhaga,,"Unsurprisingly, the United Conservative Party Government has sought leave to appeal the temporary injunction granted by the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench that halted application of Bill 9, playing havoc with Premier Jason Kenney’s strategy for putting off a crisis with the province’s public sector unions until after the federal election.

I mean, seriously, it sure doesn’t look like they’ve got a Plan B for the short term, not if they don’t want to finish off Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer’s chances of becoming prime minister on Oct. 21. So what else could they do?


Alberta Teachers Association spokesperson Jonathan Teghtmeyer at the same rally with the same bullhorn (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In half-hearted defence of the government, it does have an extensive legislative agenda – temporarily on hold because of federal political considerations – and the government’s lawyers are reported to be burning the midnight oil getting all these sure-to-be-controversial laws drafted.

Meantime, they’d like their hearing in a big fat hurry – although it’s yet to be seen whether the Alberta Court of Appeal will cooperate just because Finance Minister Travis Toews has instructed its justices to jump.

Turns out it wasn’t just me who thought the Public Sector Wage Deferral Act sounded like it was drafted on a bar napkin over drinks by somebody’s unpaid and unsupervised intern. Mr. Justice Eric Macklin, who is both better qualified and better positioned to make such judgments than your blogger, seems to have come to a somewhat similar conclusion.

Leastways, as Jonathan Teghtmeyer of the Alberta Teachers Association told the CBC Wednesday, the judge “gets pretty close to saying” that he didn’t think the legislation could stand up to the constitutional challenges that have been launched by the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, which got the injunction, and United Nurses of Alberta, and which are expected to be filed soon by the Health Sciences Association of Alberta, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and the ATA.


Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Despite the injunction, public sector unions held information pickets Wednesday in Calgary, Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton. The noisy Edmonton rally ended up on the street in front of the UCP’s party offices, where AUPE President Guy Smith and other union leaders expressed their determination to carry on the fight against Bill 9 and the fraught approach to labour relations it evokes.

Mr. Justice Macklin noted in his written judgment that “an arbitration within specified timelines is a substantive term of the Collective Agreement. Bill 9, therefore, may have impact on the … Charter right to freedom of association since it raises the issue of whether it makes collective bargaining between the government and employee representatives effectively impossible.”

“Bill 9 is a unilateral action by one of the two parties to a collective agreement, freely negotiated, to amend the terms of the agreement,” the decision continued. “AUPE compromised its position and its rights in order to reach the agreement. As stated above, the term now being amended by the legislation is substantive, therefore Bill 9 is a substantive interference with associative activity.”


Former Alberta Conservative premier Alison Redford (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Furthermore, he wrote later in the ruling, “it is generally in the public interest that parties to otherwise valid agreements, freely negotiated, honor their obligations under those agreements. Members of the public often turn to the Courts or other dispute resolution mechanisms to enforce contracts or seek remedies for their breach. …”

“Members of the public expect that parties to an agreement will honor commitments made in agreements, and they reasonably expect that parties with whom they contract, regardless of who they may be, will honor the terms of the agreement made. It is no different if one of the contracting parties is the government. A member of the public expects, and is entitled to expect, that an agreement reached with the government will be honored. …”

Therefore, he concluded, “it is in the long-term public interest for the public to see that its government cannot unilaterally change its contractual obligations through legislation that may interfere with Charter rights.”

The 10-page decision, which can be found here, is clearly written and is worth reading in its entirety.

This kind of situation is unusual, although it’s not unheard of in the troubled history of the relationship between Alberta Conservative governments and their public sector unions.


The late Jim Prentice, Conservative premier of Alberta (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The most recent example, which similarly showed signs of either slapdash legislative drafting or too much attention paid to legal advice that put ideology ahead of the law, happened in 2013 when then premier Alison Redford’s Progressive Conservatives passed obviously unconstitutional legislation that among other things included disproportionately heavy penalties for unions, their members and members of the public who dared to even advocate an illegal strike.

After Ms. Redford was effectively fired by her own caucus at the end of March 2014, the legislation lived a zombie existence before a Legislature committee, and was finally put out of its misery by the more sensible Jim Prentice after he became premier that September.

Mr. Prentice introduced legislation repealing the law, and on March 25, 2015, it was unanimously passed by the Legislature.

Alas for Mr. Prentice, by then he had already persuaded Opposition Leader Danielle Smith and most of her Wildrose Party caucus to cross the floor of the House to his PC benches, and decided to ignore convention and call an election a year earlier than almost everyone in the province wanted it. Neither of those moves pleased voters, and the result was election of the NDP led by Rachel Notley in May 2015.

Conservatives have now returned to power, but beyond a nastier tone to their rhetoric, it really doesn’t appear as if very much has changed at all since the days of Ms. Redford.

Should the Appeal Court uphold the injunction, it will be interesting to see which is more important to Mr. Kenney and his party: Preserving Mr. Scheer’s and his federal Tories’ election chances, or getting on with their own radical agenda","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">I mean, seriously, it sure doesn’t look like they’ve got a Plan B for the short term, not if they don’t want to finish off Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer’s chances of becoming prime minister on Oct. 21. So what else <i>could</i> they do?</p>

<p class=""p1"">In half-hearted defence of the government, it does have an extensive legislative agenda – temporarily on hold because of federal political considerations – and the government’s lawyers are reported to be burning the midnight oil getting all these sure-to-be-controversial laws drafted.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Meantime, they’d like their hearing in a big fat hurry – although it’s yet to be seen whether the Alberta Court of Appeal will cooperate just because Finance Minister Travis Toews has instructed its justices to jump.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Turns out it wasn’t just me who thought the <em>Public Sector Wage Deferral Act</em> sounded like it was drafted on a bar napkin over drinks by somebody’s unpaid and unsupervised intern. Mr. Justice Eric Macklin, who is both better qualified and better positioned to make such judgments than your blogger, seems to have come to a somewhat similar conclusion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Leastways, as Jonathan Teghtmeyer of the Alberta Teachers Association <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-bill-9-injunction-appeal-aupe-1.5232529"">told the CBC</a> Wednesday, the judge “gets pretty close to saying” that he didn’t think the legislation could stand up to the constitutional challenges that have been launched by the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, which got the injunction, and United Nurses of Alberta, and which are expected to be filed soon by the Health Sciences Association of Alberta, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and the ATA.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Despite the injunction, public sector unions held information pickets Wednesday in Calgary, Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton. The noisy Edmonton rally ended up on the street in front of the UCP’s party offices, where AUPE President Guy Smith and other union leaders expressed their determination to carry on the fight against Bill 9 and the fraught approach to labour relations it evokes.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Justice Macklin noted in his written judgment that “an arbitration within specified timelines is a substantive term of the Collective Agreement. Bill 9, therefore, may have impact on the … <i>Charter</i> right to freedom of association since it raises the issue of whether it makes collective bargaining between the government and employee representatives effectively impossible.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Bill 9 is a unilateral action by one of the two parties to a collective agreement, freely negotiated, to amend the terms of the agreement,” the decision continued. “AUPE compromised its position and its rights in order to reach the agreement. As stated above, the term now being amended by the legislation is substantive, therefore Bill 9 is a substantive interference with associative activity.”</p>

<p class=""p1"">Furthermore, he wrote later in the ruling, “it is generally in the public interest that parties to otherwise valid agreements, freely negotiated, honor their obligations under those agreements. Members of the public often turn to the Courts or other dispute resolution mechanisms to enforce contracts or seek remedies for their breach. …”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Members of the public expect that parties to an agreement will honor commitments made in agreements, and they reasonably expect that parties with whom they contract, regardless of who they may be, will honor the terms of the agreement made. It is no different if one of the contracting parties is the government. A member of the public expects, and is entitled to expect, that an agreement reached with the government will be honored. …”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Therefore, he concluded, “it is in the long-term public interest for the public to see that its government cannot unilaterally change its contractual obligations through legislation that may interfere with <em>Charter</em> rights.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">The 10-page decision, <a href=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/document.pdf"">which can be found here</a>, is clearly written and is worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This kind of situation is unusual, although it’s not unheard of in the troubled history of the relationship between Alberta Conservative governments and their public sector unions.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The most recent example, which similarly showed signs of either slapdash legislative drafting or too much attention paid to legal advice that put ideology ahead of the law, happened in 2013 when then premier Alison Redford’s Progressive Conservatives passed obviously unconstitutional legislation that among other things included disproportionately heavy penalties for unions, their members and members of the public who dared to even <i>advocate</i> an illegal strike.</p>
<p class=""p1"">After Ms. Redford was effectively fired by her own caucus at the end of March 2014, the legislation lived a zombie existence before a Legislature committee, and was finally put out of its misery by the more sensible Jim Prentice after he became premier that September.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Prentice introduced legislation repealing the law, and on March 25, 2015, it was unanimously passed by the Legislature.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Alas for Mr. Prentice, by then he had already persuaded Opposition Leader Danielle Smith and most of her Wildrose Party caucus to cross the floor of the House to his PC benches, and decided to ignore convention and call an election a year earlier than almost everyone in the province wanted it. Neither of those moves pleased voters, and the result was election of the NDP led by Rachel Notley in May 2015.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Conservatives have now returned to power, but beyond a nastier tone to their rhetoric, it really doesn’t appear as if very much has changed at all since the days of Ms. Redford.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Should the Appeal Court uphold the injunction, it will be interesting to see which is more important to Mr. Kenney and his party: Preserving Mr. Scheer’s and his federal Tories’ election chances, or getting on with their own radical agenda.</p>

Alberta’s political gangbangers aren’t wasting any time.

It’s painfully obvious that the UCP is out to shred collective agreements, destroy public services and poison labour relations with rabid evangelical enthusiasm these days. Is anyone really surprised?

One can go back at far as the 90s when Ralph Klein and his PC government were vilified by the International Labour Organization (celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2019) for rolling back the wages of public sector workers — again shredding collective bargaining rights entrenched in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The antagonistic history of labour relations between conservative governments and public sector unions in Alberta is no secret. It appears Jason Kenney is working diligently to add to that conservative legacy of oppressive labour relations gaffes. Dumb, really dumb.

As I recall in the case of UNA, Klein did not roll back wages.
The members voted in favour of a rollback, declining to confront
that ignorant oaf of a “leader”.

It is true that the UNA membership voted in favour of a rollback in 1994. I was one of the members who voted against it.
As I recall, at the time, I believe that there was the ‘Klein government’ promise that if UNA took a voluntary wage rollback that there would be no further layoffs. Not only did the rollback go through, but there were layoffs anyway. Lesson learned.
Many awesome, well trained Alberta health care professionals left Alberta at the time for the USA, who were only too happy to have us. In the years following, subsequent Alberta Conservative politics came to the realization re: health care professional shortages, that we needed to keep our people here and promised to keep wages high enough to keep them here. Memories seem to be a bit short. Many of us are still working in a very heavy health care workload scenario due to “not enough staff.” As the saying, perhaps, goes, “Walk a mile, or several miles, in our shoes.”
Now, as a senior UNA member who is still working ‘casual,’ I, of course, am experiencing deja vu with regard to the Kenney UCP “radical Bill 9 agenda.”

Ditto to everything you said … from another long-time UNA member who remembers the Klein cuts. I was actually a local Union officer at the time, and had to attend many a lay-off meeting with employees & management. It was a dark time indeed.

Layoffs are for when there isn’t enough work for employees to do, which was far from the case, then or now.

112,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Jason Kenney pledges ‘I will never give up on Canada’ while stoking Alberta separatist sentiment,2019-08-06 00:48:00,David Climenhaga,,"Maybe Canada needs a Clarity Act for pollsters’ questions intended to gauge the level of support for provincial secession from Canada.

The Clarity Act, of course, is the federal law passed in 2000 in response to the scary 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum that came within 1 per cent of destroying Confederation based on a murky question.

Among other things, the law states that any question not solely referring to secession was to be considered unclear, and to be valid the referendum question on independence must be clear. It also says all provinces and First Nations must be part of any separation negotiation, and that an undefined clear majority of eligible voters within the province must support secession.

To a significant degree, it was the work of Stéphane Dion, then Jean Chrétien’s minister of intergovernmental affairs and later the victim of a relentless Conservative campaign of vilification. He is probably tied with the late Robert Stanfield for the title of best prime minister Canada never had.

The province where separatism is now supposedly blossoming is Alberta, the spoiled child of Confederation. Conservative Premier Jason Kenney has been trying to make it appear there’s a viable separatist movement here, the better to discomfit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a Liberal (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In this seditious effort, spread through the use of social media memes and videos, a pious Mr. Kenney casts himself as national saviour. “I will never give up on Canada,” he said in a recent video — at least as long as there’s a chance he can be prime minister. All the while, he has been ginning up a fake national unity crisis founded on the ludicrous notion that if Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal Party are re-elected, Albertans will stream to the exits.

This cynical and unpatriotic partisan tactic by a guy who claims to be “a Canadian patriot” has been aided and abetted by a couple of polls purporting to show support for secession at levels that are, quite literally, unbelievable.

This has been amplified by a cascade of stories in the U.S.-owned Postmedia newspaper chain, which dominates the press in Alberta with an unending stream of anti-Liberal and anti-NDP bias, that appear intended to give these dubious claims credence. (New separatist parties are springing up like dandelions. One of them, I kid you not, wants to call itself the Wexit Party!)


Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt (Photo: Canadian Lacrosse Association, Twitter).

After an Abacus Data poll in late July supposedly showed a quarter of Albertans favoured separation, Postmedia’s story made no mention of Abacus CEO David Coletto’s observation that separatist sentiment “is not at a level to cause serious concern.”

“The conversation about Alberta separatism that has been in the news lately clearly has some roots within the province, but it is very much a minority view at the moment and almost exclusively within the UCP and federal Conservative Party voter group,” said the Abacus commentary on the survey.

Well, if 25 per cent of Albertans actually do favour separation, that would be cause for legitimate concern. However, this is hardly credible. (The finding that 86 per cent of Alberta separatists think climate change is a hoax is perhaps less surprising.)

“Most people in Alberta don’t believe that Canada has been a bad deal for the province, including most of those who voted for Jason Kenney and most of those intending to vote for Andrew Scheer,” the pollster also observed. “There are political hazards in stoking resentment: while a minority of Alberta conservatives cheer talk about separation; for most, it’s a project they reject.”


Abacus Data CEO David Coletto (Photo: Abacus Data).

Remember also, this was an online panel of 1,500 Canadians. Abacus doesn’t appear to say how many of these were Albertans. Abacus has not yet responded to my query about this. So let’s just guess that it was 150 or fewer. From such numbers meaningful polls can be conducted, but this one sounds so unlikely it’s safe to assume no one who answered who wasn’t in on the Conservative agenda had considered the real costs of separation.

As for the Angus Reid Institute poll in February that Mr. Kenney’s supporters have claimed shows 50-per-cent support for secession, that’s not what it actually says. The meaning of the question — “to what extent do you consider Alberta separatism to be a real possibility,” with “could happen” as an option — is ambiguous enough to please even Lucien Bouchard.

None of this, though, has stopped Mr. Kenney from trying to peddle his fatuous claim Mr. Trudeau is trying to push Alberta out of the country — you know, by buying is a $5-billion pipeline and being prepared to pony up another $10 billion to expand it, just because we want it, never mind the fact the business case for the thing is mainly fantasy.

The implication the Alberta premier is trying to foist on the rest of Canada is that if they dare not to elect a Conservative government, the fate of the planet be damned, Alberta will separate and take all its money with it. His long game strategy is probably to hope the Liberals lose lots of seats, but not quite enough to lose the government. Then he can decamp for Ottawa to “save the country,” not really being all that interested in running Alberta anyway.

Mr. Kenney’s big threat in the event he doesn’t get his way? He’ll hold a politically and constitutionally meaningless referendum on … equalization, a program founded on contributions from all Canadian taxpayers that currently uses a formula put in place by the Stephen Harper’s government when Mr. Kenney was part of it.

When Mount Royal University political science professor Duane Bratt echoed the words of the Abacus Data poll analysis on Sunday, Mr. Kenney’s official office Twitter account responded with a characteristically sophomoric attack. (This is the Trump-style account that blamed Mr. Trudeau for a federal research grant approved on Mr. Harper’s watch in 2015, and when exposed deleted the tweet without comment or apology.)

“Jason Kenney : ‘I am a Canadian patriot & am against separation,’” tweeted @UniteAlberta. “So called ‘political scientist’ : ‘Kenney stoking separatism’ What. A. Joke.”

Perhaps the way Abacus Data’s and Dr. Bratt’s similar observations rang true struck a nerve with the sensitive and ambitious Mr. Kenney’s digital Praetorian Guard.

After all, being exposed as a conniving politician willing to put our country’s future at risk for short-term political gain isn’t really a good look for a guy who still harbours his own prime ministerial ambitions. D’ya think","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

What Mr. Kenny should have said if he was being candid was probably “I will never give up on using threats of separatism to advance my political career, as long as it can be done in a somewhat plausibly deniable way”.

Whipping up a frenzy against the Federal Liberals seemed to help the UCP win the Alberta election, so I am sure Kenney will go to that well again and often. He probably will not push it as hard during the upcoming Federal election, as I think he doesn’t really want Scheer to win or even do well enough to stick around. Therefore the crisis will really be ginned up again after the Liberal win re-election, when Mr. Kenney can ride into Ottawa from the west and somehow present himself as the saviour of national unity. Think of it sort of as a Lucien Bouchard in reverse.

Now Kenney will need a straw man to do his dirty work – sound familiar? Unfortunately, I think Jeff Callaway will not be available this time and probably not interested having got burned once already by being Kenney’s dupe. The UCP will need to find someone to voice the separatist sentiment they want to stir up, that they can fund and control. Probably not someone with too much credibility, but that can get some media attention to give some appearance of reality. Perhaps a “renegade” UCP back bencher or maybe Fildebrandt will patch up his differences with Kenney.

INHO, the future premier of Alberta avoided the CPC leadership race not because of any apparent JT-momentum—which didn’t discernibly happen until well into the 2015 election campaign just four years ago; rather, the future premier didn’t want his regressive bile diluted by that of nearly the whole slate of leadership candidates whose spiteful and divisive rhetoric, easily recalled now by ScheerCon rivals for deployment in the current federal race, had driven moderate contenders from the field and moderate conservative-minded voters to other parties, and remains a negative in Con-electability terms—not when he could spew his own bile without competition, unadulterated, and have it boil into an electability positive in Alberta.

I don’t think Alberta is some kind of proving ground or spirit mountain that would viably descend a provincial politician upon the whole of Canada as Prime Minister. It’s more like a safe redoubt whence the neo-right can observe, plan and train for its victorious return to federal power, its mythological mainstay until that ‘glorious day.’ One difficulty: the vengeful imagery neo-rightists use to keep their base inside the wagon laager and on-script until that day of self-righteous justice is still a hard sell in the ROC+Que. (or AOC—Alta.).

The repellant tRump presiduncy has the perverse effect of reinforcing the growing repugnance middle-of-the-roaders have for the very same rhetoric the Canadian neo-right appears to have adopted from our southern neighbours’ own, critical dichotomy.

Jason Kenney has to be feeling cranky about how things have turned out. Kenney was Stephen Harper’s right hand man, and generally regarded as the CPC heir apparent leader when Harper retired. Justin Trudeau appeared so unbeatable in the 2015 election, however, Kenney thought he would spend the rest of his career in opposition so he looked elsewhere. Four years later poor Jason must really be regretting that decision.

I do wonder how much that explains Kenney’s nearly visceral dislike of our prime minister. (He has the depth of a finger bowl etc.) I really do wonder if at some time before the 2015 election, Kenney and Harper had some kind of long-term strategy discussion where the plan emerged that after the CPC won the 2015 election, Stephen Harper would retire in, say 2017, and Jason Kenney could ascend to the throne. Remember that by 2017 Mr. Harper would have been PM for over a decade. Is it only Justin Trudeau’s meteoric rise five years ago that has allowed us to avoid Prime Minister Jason Kenney running for reelection?

Of course an established politician would hate Trudeau. Trudeau’s success is entirely due to his last name and the master manipulation skills of Gerald Butts. Trudeau’s only skills are looking good and having a good time. Like him or not, it would be tough not to claim that Kenney is where he is due to hard work.

All of the party leaders are weak. The people behind Scheer’s curtain, i.e. remnants of the Harper apparatus, are less evil than those behind Trudeau, i.e. Telford and Butts. Singh doesn’t even have someone behind the curtain which is why he flounders.

“The finding that 86 per cent of Alberta separatists think climate change is a hoax…”

This clearly shows what sort of ‘information’ these people take in to inform their opinions. Clearly their information source does include anything that discusses the difficulty the UK is having from just withdrawing from a trade deal, if they think a couple of landlocked provinces can just walk away.

I do wonder how much of the problem is from radio commentary. If you think about the context that someone listens to radio commentary, it is usually while they are doing something else – driving, operating machinery, doing house work etc. As such, they are only listening with half their attention, while the other half focuses on what they are doing. In this context there really isn’t any opportunity to run what is being said on the radio through a BS filter; the information just gets accepted as fact.

This is pure politics meant to distract Albertans from the real issues..current and anticipated. Much the same as the Premiers ridiculous suggestion that his salary be cut by 10 percent and MLA’s salaries be cut by 5 percent.

I want a premier who focuses on problem solving and growing our economy. Neither of these actions will serve Albertans well. Smoke and mirrors.

Surely Albertans are not so dense as to swallow this nonsense.

Kenney has focus on the two biggest problems facing Alberta: a hostile investment climate and unsustainable provincial spending levels. Non-renewable resource income is unlikely to rebound given the massive natural gas surplus in the US. Kenney needs to reduce per capita spending from its Canada if not world leading levels. The MLA pay cut is the opening salvo of rolling back all provincial, municipal, school, university and healthcare salaries by 5%. That action will only close about $1.5B of the deficit. Further 8p

Most people in Alberta/Canada don’t know it but Jason Kenney takes his marching orders from Preston Manning followed by Stephen Harper and the Religious Right. Preston Manning’s Reform Party could never win in B.C. and took over the B.C. Liberal party fooling B.C. voters thinking they were voting Liberal when they voted Christy Clark a Reform Party Con. Alberta got fooled again by voting in Jason Kenney another Con.

As I look at the commentary on the upcoming federal election one thing is very obvious, for Justin Trudeau to repeat as Prime Minister votes in Quebec will be more important than ever resulting in a campaign which will pander to eastern Canada. This is certainly nothing new and only people wearing ideological blinders could fail to see this. It is also very obvious that Alberta’s future ability to balance it’s budget with ever increasing energy royalties is not going to materialize. I think this cold realization combined with increasingly restrictive federal energy policies that will occur under a second term of Justin Trudeau will certainly make more and more Albertan’s question their place in Canada. For many years I have watched as Quebec essentially and very effectively blackmailed Canada with the threat of separation, I see no problem with Alberta employing the same game plan. Enjoy your day.

The problem is that Alberta will always lack political influence. Despite having the 3rd largest economy and 4th largest population among provinces, Alberta has the fewest MP’s and Senators per capita. It also lacks institutions like media outlets, established universities and old money to influence government. With minimal leverage, Alberta’s only tack against hostile federal policy is to out work and out smart, which was key to the Harper government’s success.

In fact, as of the 2011 census, Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario have the same number of seats per capita, to within rounding error. Your statement is numerically correct, but very misleading. Deliberately misleading, I would say.

The relative ages of Universities seems a strange factor to fixate on. The University of Alberta is one of the oldest Universities in Canada, founded in 1908, the same year as UBC; yeah, UT, McGill and few others are older, because Ontario and Quebec were established long before Alberta was dreamed of. Dalhousie was founded in 1818, 9 years before UT’s first incarnation as King’s College, and you don’t hear Ontario whining about that. You’d also need to present some evidence that this factors as such conferred some disadvantage to Alberta.

Finally, what federal policies specifically do you consider “hostile” to Alberta, and why?

Actually, the seat counts in the House of Commons fairly accurately reflect the population differentials amongst our provincial & territorial jurisdictions, allowing for some rounding error. Remember, there are about as many people in the Greater Toronto Area alone—the so-called “GTA”—as in all of Alberta; is it any wonder, then, that there are so many more seats in Ontario than in Alberta? Remember Sir John A & “rep by pop”, which in 1867 was a significant departure from the status quo ante, when Canada East and Canada West each had equal numbers of seats despite their differing population numbers. This principle still holds in our country, and is the reason Ontario has so many seats. It’s no different, in principle, from the House of Representatives south of the border, which has far more members from California (53) than, say, Wyoming (1).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives

Yes, it is true that seat counts in the Senate are inequitable, but the Senate is not the chamber of Confidence and Supply, and does not regulate the fiscal position of the Government. Reapportioning Senate seats would also entail opening a Constitutional can of worms, which Canadians have had no appetite for since the Mulroney years and the failed Meech Lake & Charlottetown accords.

Or they could just increase taxes. Alberta has managed to have the lowest taxes in Canada because of energy royalties, but now those royalties are dwindling and that revenue needs to be replaced. Non-petro state provinces use higher taxes to provide services. According to U of C economist Trevor Tombe, Quebec’s tax rates are roughly double Alberta’s; if we chose to adopt that province’s tax level we would have a surplus of $14 billion.

Bob I did a quick bit of research to compare Alberta’s and Quebec’s tax rates. Personal tax in Quebec top rate for over $104765 income is 25.75%, in Alberta the top personal tax rate is 15% over $303900. So in Quebec when you combine the top provincial rate plus the top federal rate of 33% you would pay 58.75% income tax, imagine that. The corporate tax rate in Quebec is 11.6% and in Alberta the corporate tax rate was recently lowered to 11% from 12%. In Quebec the provincial sales tax is 9.75% and in Alberta 0. A couple other points of interest in 2017 according to Statscan the GDP of Quebec was $417.2 billion and in Alberta it was $331.9 billion. Provincial budgets, in Quebec they will spend $113 billion in 2019-2020, keep in mind over 10% of Quebec’s budget comes from $13 billion in federal equalization payments. No new budget yet for Alberta but we spent just over $56 billion in 2018-2019.

Bob I would agree that Quebec’s tax rates applied in Alberta would significantly increase revenue, a 9.75% sales tax would in theory raise just under $10 billion and erase our deficit. I was interested to see that Quebec has a fairly reasonable corporate tax rate. Enjoy your day.

Oil prices are not likely to rebound anytime soon and natural gas prices will be low for a long time. The PC’s under the leadership of Ralph Klein brought Alberta to this mess. He stopped all infrastructure spending such as road building, schools and hospital construction at a time Alberta had half the population and the last 8 years Alberta has been trying to catch up, plus natural gas prices were at record highs which made it easy for RK to balance the budget. If Kenney follows RK’s lead Alberta will be in a greater disaster situation 5 to 10 years from now, Kenney has already blown a 4.5 billion budget deficit by giving corporates a reduction in taxes with no guarantee that will benefit the Alberta economy. Under the previous government Alberta had the 3rd lowest number of provincial employees per population in the country. And RK’s outsourcing never worked and cost Alberta billions, just check the government financial records.

111,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Symbolic MLA pay cut set stage for attack on public services – so why did the NDP support it,2019-08-07 14:26:00,David Climenhaga,,"Like neoliberals everywhere, Alberta’s Conservatives overrate the virtues of big business and undervalue those of democracy. This is not exactly news.

This was a clear message yesterday from the vote of the Legislature’s Member Services Committee to cut MLA salaries by 5 per cent, and twice that for the premier’s pay. The vote illustrated nicely the United Conservative Party’s contempt for the work of the Legislature, which in the case of its own MLAs may be quite justified as they rubber-stamp tax cuts for billionaires and foreign corporations.


Heather Sweet, NDP MLA on the Member Services Committee (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The pay cut also provided a convenient distraction from the twin embarrassments of the ongoing investigation into internal UCP corruption by the Office of the Election Commissioner and the judicial ruling that granted an injunction to a union seeking to block the government’s effort to use legislation to break a legal contract.

But why did NDP MLAs like Thomas Dang who sit on the Member Services Committee vote in favour of this policy and the damaging symbolic point it makes?


Nicole Goehring, NDP MLA on the Member Services Committee (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I mention Mr. Dang because he obviously spoke the truth when he told the committee that cutting “the pay of politicians a few hundred dollars a month to give them licence to screw over the working people of Alberta is frankly ridiculous.” This is true even though committee chair and Speaker Nathan Cooper ruled plain speaking in terms every Albertan can understand to be “unparliamentary.”

Of course, there should be no surprise about Premier Jason Kenney going ahead with his campaign promises to cut the salaries of Alberta’s MLAs while pouring billions into “job creating” tax breaks for foreign fossil fuel corporations and local billionaires.


Member Services Committee Chair Nathan Cooper (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The pay cuts are purely symbolic. They won’t save much money, and MLA compensation in this province was probably set about right to reflect the work and responsibilities of elected members. Mainstream economics, in addition, teach us the tax giveaways won’t create many jobs, certainly not as many as would a similar investment in public services. The gains will mostly be used by corporations to buy back shares. In Premier Kenney’s United Conservative Party, however, ideology always trumps factual analysis.

When the premier inevitably says “promise made, promise kept,” though, who are we to argue with him? Albertans undeniably voted for this, no matter how damaging it turns out to be.

But why is the NDP lining up with what is obviously intended as a symbolic gesture to justify slashing the pay of Alberta’s public employees as part of a more general policy of gutting public services?

This is a question worth pondering for those of us who voted for the NDP to protect our public services during what was obviously going to be a conservative government dogmatic in its commitment to austerity and extreme market fundamentalism. We’re certainly entitled to ask it. After all, our votes, especially in the city of Edmonton, saved the NDP as a viable party in the Legislature.

Of course, Mr. Dang made this point in the deliberations of this committee, when he identified the obvious motivation of the UCP for implementing the MLA pay cut. But so what? From the perspective of practical politics, what is important, and what will be remembered, is that the vote of the committee was unanimous. In addition to Mr. Dang, the MLA for Edmonton-South, the committee includes NDP MLAs Jasvir Deol, Edmonton-Meadows; Nicole Goehring, Edmonton-Castle Downs; and Heather Sweet, Edmonton-Manning.

According to Global News, “Opposition NDP members on the committee voted for the cut as the right thing to do, given Alberta’s struggling oil and gas-based economy,” which is a strange position to take for a party that just weeks ago was arguing with some justification that the economy was on the mend thanks to its stewardship.

Even if that position made sense, and even if political necessity drove it, the timing is terrible given Mr. Dang’s accurate assessment of the UCP’s motivation. But does anyone seriously believe that how NDP committee members voted yesterday will be a serious issue in the 2023 general election?

The NDP did their friends and supporters no favour with this vote.

Libraries next in line for hit as UCP channels Doug Ford

Mr. Ford, as readers will probably have forgotten, has a hate on for public libraries, presumably in part because Margaret Atwood, the famous author, once bested him in public debate about this topic.

In Mr. Kenney’s case, conniver that he is, he’s holding back on the real bad news until after the federal election so as not to upset federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s applecart, at least not enough to be implicated in its rollover.

So! The top guy takes a cut and all the underlings take a cut. Why did they opt for a raise for foreign shareholders and CEO’s via a tax cut for the largest among us? I’m in pain in my brain! So! Given I am a snapshot in time? I’ll prefer this one, thank you very much! https://youtu.be/ovPUFPkaE_A

POGO: why did the NDP vote for this right wing canard which legitimizes UCP cuts to anything worth while? One might as well ask why the chicken crossed the road. Perhaps the explanation is both simple and rather unkind: the NDP just wants to fit in and be liked. I’ll see your Tragically Hip and raise you one Cyndi Lauper:https://youtu.be/PIb6AZdTr-A

I have three observations.

1. Either way, this is a no-win situation for the NDP. They’ll just have to live to fight another day.

2. If the UCP is trying to downplay their Halloween budget in advance of Andrew Scheer’s electoral push, they’re doing a good job of building up the suspense. In a slasher movie, it’s the build-up that really scares everybody.

3. There seem to be a lot of moving parts in everything Jason Kenney does. He’s an inveterate schemer, even when he doesn’t have to be–as in the UCP leadership campaign–and that could be a problem. We’ll see in future how being too clever by half works out for him–even in Alberts with its herd-like ways and supine press.

The NDP probably supported it because it is truly popular, unlike the cuts that will probably follow it. Kenney will find out about the later part soon enough if he goes down that path, much like Doug Ford is now to his regret. Are the two inexorably linked? Well, only in the minds of Conservatives.

Is the public going to care or cut the Conservatives some slack when they close their hospitals, reduce staffing in schools or cut back libraries that Kenney in crew took a pay cut? Nope, probably not. So go ahead Mr. Kenney, cut your pay some more if you want – you’ve earned it!

The NDP probably supported it because they essentially had no choice; that’s the essential problem with politicians setting their own compensation. Had they voted against, they would have been tarred as greedy; had they abstained, as chicken.

There are a few potential approaches to politicians’ compensation that could,hav integrity. One is an independent panel, like we do for judges; another, which is common at the municipal level, is for changes to political compensation to take effect after the next election.

But, my preferred option is more radical: pay them nothing—or some token amount, like a toonie a year—as base salary. Instead, set up a salary replacement model, wherein whatever loss in income they suffer by leaving their previous (non-political) job behind is replaced, dollar for dollar. Retirees would be allowed to continue receiving their pensions, if any, including public pensions like CPP & OAS. For the self-employed, like lawyers & physicians, there would have to be some safeguards to prevent them torquing up their incomes before running for office; using tax years prior to their first action taken to become a candidate—like running for a nomination—would probably suffice. Out of pocket expenses for travel, meals & accommodations while on Legislature business would be reimbursed under terms, conditions & amounts identical to those for unionized public servants. But, in my view, no person should be advantaged by holding elected public office, nor should they be disadvantaged.

But in politics, not so much.

Why do you think political operatives love to leak a scandal just before there’s an election, when there’s not enough time to set the story straight, if straight it can be set?

So the fact the dual investigations into allegations of vote fraud in the 2017 United Conservative Party leadership race won by Jason Kenney, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the other by the Office of the Election Commissioner, continue to turn over new rocks, must be troubling indeed to the Alberta premier’s strategic brain trust.

In a way, it’s even worse for them that it’s happening at the start of the UCP’s mandate, when no sneaky political opponent with some fake news up his sleeve would go to the trouble of spreading a false story. Why bother? There’s far too much time for the victim of the tale to prove his innocence.

So reports like the Star’s saying the Mounties are now talking to federal Conservative politicians does not look good on either Mr. Kenney’s UCP or, one supposes, Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party of Canada.


Calgary-East MLA Peter Singh (Photo: Facebook).

According to the Star, the RCMP have now interviewed Tim Uppal, the former Member of Parliament for Edmonton-Sherwood Park and former minister of state in Stephen Harper’s CPC cabinet who is now running in the Edmonton Mill Woods federal riding, hoping to unseat Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi.

A statement from Mr. Uppal, given to the Star by federal Conservative Party officials, said, “Yes, I sat down with RCMP.” This was followed by the disclaimer Albertans have now grown accustomed to hearing: “But I was not the subject of the meeting.”

Calgary-East UCP MLA Peter Singh, whose office was also raided by police with computers and records removed, and five cabinet ministers have also been interviewed by the Mounties. Each of the ministers said they were not the subject of their meetings.

So far, it would seem that no one is the subject of the Mounties’ investigation, which makes one wonder why they’re pursuing it. The explanation, of course, is that someone is, we just haven’t yet been told who it is.

The federal Opposition leader, of course, does face an election fairly soon, and he’s been dishing out some fairly questionable claims about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, so he can now expect to get as good as he gives.


Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson (Photo: Office of the Election Commissioner).

It’s Mr. Kenney, though, who really has to worry about the impression this is leaving — and not just with voters in Alberta, if we believe what we have been told about his personal prime ministerial ambitions.

Meanwhile, the CBC reported yesterday that Premier Kenney says the Office of the Election Commissioner will not necessarily be spared budget cuts just because it’s investigating his leadership campaign when he gets around to his big austerity campaign, which is to be introduced after the Oct. 21 federal election so that no one can accuse him of trying to sandbag Mr. Scheer.

The CBC popped that question after it discovered the office was investigating an allegation that Mr. Kenney himself had advised an out-of-pocket former party operative that someone else would pay for 600 memberships the volunteer had signed up. That, of course, would be illegal.

“Asked whether he would commit to funding the office in order to avoid the perception of interference in an investigation involving his campaign, Kenney demurred,” the CBC reported politely.

Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson, appointed by the previous NDP government and not particularly liked by the Conservatives, has already slapped fines of more than $163,000 on people involved in candidate Jeff Callaway’s “Kamikaze Campaign,” which is said to have been set up to slime the campaign run by former Wildrose leader Brian Jean and then to go away when that work was done.

Oddly, at the time of the leadership campaign, this was spoken of as if it were common knowledge and no one seemed to mind. Now there are many denials.

I’m sure the UCP would love an excuse to send Mr. Gibson packing as soon as possible, and austerity might just provide the excuse they need. But they’re going to have to tough it out for a couple more months, by the sound of it.

I’m guessing Kenney’s leadership campaign was run by a gang of over zealous youngsters (maybe junior staffers from the Cdn Taxpayers Federation or other such AstroTurf group) who were running amuck, breaking rules they didn’t necessarily know existed, leaving more seasoned political operatives shaking their head.
Stephen Harper had a flock like this surrounding him while in office. There were complaints that he was being insulated and long time Tory gunslingers were having difficulty getting access.
“The boys in short pants,” one disgruntled high profile cabinet minister called them. Peter McKay, I think.

Anything news related to the PC, sorry – UCP leadership convention (getting my scandal plagued parties mixed up today) can probably be summed up in four words for the UCP – BAD, BAD, NOT GOOD!!! I suspect Mr. Kenney would probably even secretly agree with my assessment.

There is the slow drip, drip of revelations which could eventually have a corrosive effect on support for the UCP government. Sure it is still in the honeymoon phase right now, but come fall apparently “tough” choices will be made. I think that in combination with the simmering scandal that refuses to dies could cause a serious hit to UCP popularity and bring the honeymoon to a quick end. Its never fun when honeymoons end, Kenney could ask PM Trudeau about that if he wanted – oh on second thought he probably isn’t interested in getting any political advise from the PM. Trudeau was fortunate that his honeymoon was extended, perhaps because he seems to be a likeable person with charisma. Kenney seems neither likeable or charismatic.

The UCP is really in a pickle here. If they too overtly force out the Election Commissioner, it could blow up on them. The commissioner might actually be more free to help the investigation, which will go on whether he is in the position or not. Kenney can’t fire the RCMP nor can he fire the out of province Crown Prosecutor leading it. He can’t even try trash the prosecutors reputation, a la Trump and the Republicans tried to do to Muller. Maybe Kenney if desperate could lean on Doug Ford to somehow reign in or restrain the prosecutor, but at this point I think Ford might be wary of adding another scandal to his own plate. Ford is already is dealing with a couple of them on political appointments – one to head the OPP and another on numerous questionable patronage appointments made by his former Chief of Staff.

One of the reasons to establish the UCP was to get away from the tarnished and scandal plagued reputation of the former PCs. Perhaps might have helped them a bit to win the last election, but just because you are new, doesn’t mean your reputation remains unsullied or impeccable for long.

109,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Postmedia seeks new editor for Edmonton Journal – what became of the old one,2019-08-09 01:18:00,David Climenhaga,,"Postmedia is now advertising for a new editor-in-chief for the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun.

It may come as something of a surprise to Edmonton readers that English Canada’s largest newspaper corporation is seeking “a dynamic, innovative journalistic leader to oversee the editorial vision and content of Postmedia’s Edmonton newsroom, which includes both the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun.”


Kevin Libin’s ironically cropped Linkedin portrait (Photo: Linkedin).

After all, didn’t they have just such a person in Mark Iype, who was appointed to the same position barely three years ago?

“Mark is a passionate leader who cares deeply about delivering outstanding editorial content,” Lorne Motley, Postmedia’s vice-president of editorial for its Western Canadian newspapers, said in an email to staff on Sept. 21, 2016. For the past three years, staff at the two Edmonton newspapers seemed to agree.

Mr. Iype’s appointment had an inauspicious start, immediately following the purge of three respected women editors, Journal editor-in-chief Margo Goodhand, Journal managing editor Stephanie Coombs, and Sun managing editor Donna Harker, as well as the combination of the two papers’ newsrooms into a single workplace.


Mr. Libin’s former colleague and boyhood friend, Ezra Levant (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

But from an outsider’s perspective, he has done a good job as editor-in-chief, presiding over an editorial board that was even willing on occasion to express opinions that reflected the Edmonton community rather than the hard-right market fundamentalism which daily seems more prevalent within Postmedia. On May 24, the Journal even dared to run an editorial calling on Premier Jason Kenney’s then-new United Conservative Party Government to keep the NDP’s carbon tax!

“Killing the provincial carbon tax is one political promise that will be better to break,” the editorial boldly proclaimed – no doubt to the deep dissatisfaction of Postmedia executives in Toronto and the corporation’s owners in the United States.

So what happened to Mr. Iype? That isn’t immediately clear. While his name disappeared from the Journal’s masthead earlier this week, he is said to be still toiling for Postmedia, perhaps figuring out ways to save money on newsprint, in the Journal’s building in downtown Edmonton. His Twitter account’s thumbnail biography, rather evocatively, now says only, “I’d rather be sailing.”


Postmedia Western Canada VP Lorne Motley (Photo: Facebook).

The question must be asked if the departure of Mr. Iype has anything to do with the arrival of Kevin Libin as Postmedia executive in charge of all political coverage, federal and provincial, in the pages of Postmedia’s daily newspapers and the websites that are nowadays their main presence with readers.

Mr. Libin is well known as one of Canada’s most right-wing commentators. He was founding editor of the Western Standard, the far-right magazine published by his boyhood friend Ezra Levant, who later went on to create the Rebel Media video blog.

In 2015, the British Columbia Supreme Court awarded damages of $50,000 to climate scientist Andrew Weaver, now the Leader of the Green Party in the B.C. Legislature, for articles published in the National Post in 2010. Mr. Libin and other writers and editors where named in Mr. Weaver’s suit. In 2017, however, the ruling was overturned on appeal and a new trial was ordered.


Senior Postmedia content executive Lucinda Chodan (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Libin’s appointment, a Maclean’s Magazine commentator asserted on Tuesday, “means a single voice – and an ideological one – will now oversee or directly run political coverage in a fleet of papers, many of which are not conservative papers at all, beginning in an election year.”

It’s a bit of a reach to say many Postmedia papers are not conservative at all, but the Maclean’s piece by Sarmishta Subramanian sums up the problem of having a political commissar, who once characterized opponents of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project as assassins, now organizing the political coverage by one of the country’s largest media corporations during an election campaign.

Under Mr. Iype, political reporters at Postmedia’s Edmonton papers – as opposed to the corporation’s stable of consistently right-leaning Alberta commentators – still had the freedom to cover news stories responsibly. They must now be deeply concerned about their professional futures under the leadership of an ideologue.

None of Mr. Iype, Mr. Libin, Mr. Motley, or Lucinda Chodan – the Montreal-based Postmedia editor and executive who recently informed Edmonton Journal and Sun employees of Mr. Libin’s new role in an email – responded before publication to emailed requests for comment on this story. Mr. Libin eventually did, however, several days after the story was published, referring all questions to Postmedia Communications VP Phylise Gelfand for comment.

NOTE: This story has been updated to reflect the fact the ruling in B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver’s defamation suit was overturned by the B.C. Court of Appeal in April 2017 and a new trial ordered, which was omitted from the original version, as well as to note that one person emailed for comment eventually responded after the story had been published","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p>In 2015, the British Columbia Supreme Court <a href=""https://thenarwhal.ca/climate-scientists-andrew-weaver-wins-50-000-defamation-suit-against-national-post-terence-corcoran/"">awarded damages of $50,000 to climate scientist Andrew Weaver</a>, now the Leader of the Green Party in the B.C. Legislature, for articles published in the <em>National Post</em> in 2010. Mr. Libin and other writers and editors where named in Mr. Weaver’s suit. In 2017, however, <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/news/british-columbia/bc-appeal-court-overturns-decision-in-andrew-weavers-defamation-suit/article34786469/"">the ruling was overturned</a> on appeal and a new trial was ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. Libin’s appointment, <a href=""https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-new-worry-about-the-next-election-your-daily-news/"">a <em>Maclean’s Magazine</em> commentator asserted</a> on Tuesday, “means a single voice – and an ideological one – will now oversee or directly run political coverage in a fleet of papers, many of which are not conservative papers at all, beginning in an election year.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a reach to say many Postmedia papers are not conservative at all, but the <em>Maclean’s</em> piece by Sarmishta Subramanian sums up the problem of having a political commissar, who once characterized opponents of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project <a href=""https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/kevin-libin-the-pessimists-have-it-right-assassins-are-gunning-for-trans-mountain"">as assassins,</a>&nbsp;now organizing the political coverage by one of the country’s largest media corporations during an election campaign.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Iype, political reporters at Postmedia’s Edmonton papers – as opposed to the corporation’s stable of consistently right-leaning Alberta commentators – still had the freedom to cover news stories responsibly. They must now be deeply concerned about their professional futures under the leadership of an ideologue.</p>
<p>None of Mr. Iype, Mr. Libin, Mr. Motley, or Lucinda Chodan – the Montreal-based Postmedia editor and executive who recently informed Edmonton Journal and Sun employees of Mr. Libin’s new role in an email – responded before publication to emailed requests for comment on this story. Mr. Libin eventually did, however, several days after the story was published, referring all questions to Postmedia Communications VP Phylise Gelfand for comment.</p>

Wonder when Postmedia is going to be helping themselves to some of that sweet coin in Justin Trudeau’s newspaper fund. Can’t wait for the day when Libin will be editorializing on the virtues of free markets in the morning and cashing a check courtesy of the Canadian taxpayer in the afternoon.

I for one am totally shocked — not likely!

Most discerning media consumers likely theorized that the merging of the two Edmonton Postmedia newsrooms was the thin edge of the wedge toward unbridled Fox News-like conservative coverage — it was just a matter of time. With the addition of Mr. Libin the master plan is complete and the all systems go for the forthcoming federal election that will see unfettered support for Andrew Scheer and the CPC — with heightened Justin Trudeau bashing. All he’s really missing now… are Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

I am guessing the ad did not say Liberals and Socialists need not apply, but I suspect Post mortal media’s reputation probably allows potential applicant to figure it that out.

We are going into a Federal election campaign soon, so it seems these newspapers will make every effort to provide partisan support to the Conservatives, even at the expense of diminished credibility with readers. I am not sure it is a good business decision to alienate even more readers, but if the owners were making good business decisions, their papers might be in better financial shape. Yes, they continue to use the excuse of on line news and advertising for their poor financial performance, and no doubt it does make the business much more challenging, but some other publications have found a way to survive and some even thrive in this era.

No doubt, the Post will just lay off a few more staff in response to further revenue declines. Most of the more liberal columnists have already gone or been laid off, so it will be interesting to see the reaction by the more conservative columnists who tow the company line if they get a pink slip. In the end, I doubt their will be much reward for them, they may eventually go down with the ship anyways. Ask Sears employees how well that went for them. However, I am sure the newspaper owners know that there are few things like fear of losing their jobs to make most employees more compliant and obedient, at least in the short run.

In fairness, Premier Kenney has two nice suits, one grey and one grey-blue, or maybe blue-grey. His favourite blue blazer looks hideous and gives his advisors the vapours, especially when he wears it with his baggy chinos. I’ve been saying for weeks he got the nice suits from Sam, who until the NDP came to town was the tailor to the political stars in Alberta. I simply assumed, because who else could make a suit that nicely cut in Edmonton? But I now have it on good authority they came from the Henry Singer haberdashery. Whoever did the work, I doff my homburg to any tailor who can make Mr. Kenney look sharp. You must have a song for that, Pogo. No? DJC

Kevin Libin’s brother, Mark, was my roommate for two years when we were Masters students at U of T. Mark was a great roommate…quiet, thoughtful guy with an appreciation for good literature and quality pop culture (he was an English student, after all). Lost contact with him after we finished our degrees but googled him the other day and saw a great photo of him on the picket lines of a faculty strike at U of Manitoba, where he is a prof. I expect the political talk around the dinner table during extended family get-togethers could get rather interesting.

Even the New York Times, which along with much of the mainstream media in the United States could be accused until recently of seriously underplaying the climate change story, seems to be getting up to speed on the topic.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In July and so far in August, the Times has published no fewer than 93 news and commentary stories containing the words “climate change” in its pages. Three of them were published yesterday. While a range of interpretations and commentary are found in these articles, the overwhelming theme is that climate change is real, it’s happening now, and the consequences for the planet are serious.

In the context of the policy debate about this topic in Alberta, some of the headlines are very significant, because they give us a hint of the direction the rest of the world is moving, even as Alberta and Saskatchewan continue to debate a question that’s been settled.

Consider this selection of recent Times headlines, chosen not quite randomly to make the point that climate change is now assumed to be a thing, no longer a topic of debate, no matter how angry that makes Premier Jason Kenney, his “War Room,” and their legion of Twitter trolls:“Europe’s Heat Wave, Fueled by Climate Change, Moves to Greenland”

Former Alberta Premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“A More Active Hurricane Season Could Lie Ahead, Scientists Warn”
“How Hot Was July? Hotter Than Ever, Global Data Shows”
“Climate Change Fills Storms With More Rain, Analysis Shows”
“Automakers, Rejecting Trump Pollution Rule, Strike a Deal With California”
“Moody’s Buys Climate Data Firm, Signaling New Scrutiny of Climate Risks”

The last two in particular should make blood of the operatives in Mr. Kenney’s strategic bunker run cold. After all, there’s nothing makes your typical UCP mouthpiece angrier than the suggestion that the day is coming when the market for Alberta’s bitumen will shrink, and back in the days of Rachel Notley’s NDP Government, there was nothing the Conservative Opposition liked to shriek about more than a decline in the provincial credit rating given by firms like Moody’s Investors Service.

If climate change is now going to be an assumed reality like gravity, elsewhere if not here, it doesn’t really matter how “ethical” our oil is, and that’s not good news for the Kenney Government’s business strategy.

And if those two headlines from the same time frame don’t concern anyone, think about these two:“Climate Change Is a Winning Campaign Issue — and President Trump Knows It”
“Climate Could Be an Electoral Time Bomb, Republican Strategists Fear”


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Now, this is not to suggest that Alberta and its equally cranky provincial neighbour to the east are going to go Green any time soon. No, in these places we will hang on to our charming faith in the future of fossil fuels with the determination of a West Virginia coal miner assessing the potential for anthracite.

But it may contain some hints of what’s likely to happen in Canada in October, and in the United States in November 2020.

Political developments in the most important markets for our principal export matter. To put the best possible light on his trip, perhaps that’s the reason Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen went south in 2016 to campaign for Donald Trump.

If you think Alberta’s fossil fuel resources are in danger of being turned into a stranded asset now, with a prime minister willing to spend billions buying us a pipeline and expanding it regardless of what abuse we heap on him, imagine what things will look like with an activated U.S. population fearful about climate change and a Democratic president in the White House inclined to do something about it!


Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

As for those who say our Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is involved in a secret plot to close down the oilsands development, there’s really no hope for such people. What Mr. Trudeau is doing and former NDP premier Rachel Notley was too is trying to buy a few more years for Alberta’s economic mainstay while we figure out what the hell to do next.

Mr. Kenney’s strategy of yelling at anyone who disagrees is not going to prove very effective if the world comes to the conclusion, as now appears to be happening, that climate change is real and an international response to it is urgently required.

The only approach that was likely to work, it’s said here, was Ms. Notley’s much reviled “social license” strategy, and given what’s happening even that had a definite best-before stamp with a date not too far in the future on it.

Even if President Trump is re-elected and federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer manages somehow to become prime minister, the respite is bound to be a short one, and our comeuppance will be worse when it happens.

But as the headlines suggest, in the rest of Canada and south of the 49th Parallel, climate change increasingly looks like a winning issue, just not for Republican climate change deniers and their Conservative lookalikes in Canada.

The money boys down Wall Street way are certainly moving on. One bank analysis is now claiming oil needs to fall to $20 a barrel for it to compete with renewables. I’m no math scientist but with oil costing $90 a barrel in the Texas shale oil fields you have to think the days of oil are numbered.

There can be no denying climate change. At some point a few of the UCP folks who have been denying it for so long are going to start to look just a little silly even to their staunchest supporters.

I recently had a casual conversation with a staunch UCP supporter who told me that the current federal equalization agreement was obviously the fault of that terrible Liberal Gov’t. I mentioned that, in fact, it was Stephen Harper’s team who put the last agreement in place and it was Jason Kenney who sold it to us.

The person was in disbelief. I think this is where the global warming/climate change was a year or so ago. In the headlines, people read/heard the short blurbs and believed all the less than factual statements from politicians on both sides. I suspect that this has changed over the past 18 months.

Some politicians are starting to look rather silly and rather short sighted, They remind me of those very odd people who deny the existence of dinosaurs-some with the extreme view that the bones and fossils were planted by those who want to hoodwink us. Go figure…it takes all kinds even science deniers.

I believe that this is one of the reasons why Scheers recent climate and carbon reduction plan was greeting with such criticism. The media, and the public moved past the headline to quickly see that it was all smoke and mirrors with zero content and no plan whatsoever. Instead of being a boost it is proving to be somewhat of an embarrassment to the Party. I am not certain that this would have been the case a year ago. A recent column by Chantel Hebert suggests that Scheers plan may be hurting Conservative support int Quebec for this very reason.

Kenney and the UCP need to pay some attention to this and to understand that, on this topic, many Albertans are starting to read and gain a true understanding of the issues.

“What Mr. Trudeau is doing and former NDP premier Rachel Notley was too is trying to buy a few more years for Alberta’s economic mainstay while we figure out what the hell to do next.”

Pipelines, LNG plants, and oilsands mines are not intended to last “a few years”. Major fossil fuel infrastructure takes decades to recoup its capital costs. Making such huge investments locks us into a fossil-fuel future.
Digging the hole deeper makes it that much harder to climb out.

New pipelines and oilsands expansion cannot be reconciled with Canada’s (inadequate) emissions targets. In plain English, building pipelines puts Canada’s emissions targets out of reach for decades. It’s a plan to fail for decades.

If the world takes real action on climate change, all these assets are likely to be stranded. The ultimate oil price crash will be devastating for Alberta.
Doing our children no favor.

There are benefits to being a big fish in a small pond, as Mr. Kenney has probably discovered, but there are also drawbacks. As an export driven, resource producing province, Alberta is at the mercy of the whims and preferences of its national and international markets. The world and Canada is increasingly concerned about climate change and Kenney’s war room in unlikely to have much impact on this. Whether Alberta fully appreciates this yet or not, Kenney is sort of like King Canute sitting at the sea side trying to get the tide not to rise.

This is another reason why I suspect Kenney will quickly tire of being the big fish in the small pond and try to engineer a return to the big pond, probably before his lack of success in Alberta becomes made widely aware of, particularly to Conservatives outside of Alberta. I think the only good news for Alberta is that our energy industry will not disappear overnight. Much like coal in West Virginia it will continue on for a long time, however it is likely the days of its hectic growth, expansion and boom have probably ended. I don’t think politicians who deny or ignore this are doing us any favours as delaying the adjustment will probably make it more painful. Of course, long before then I suspect Kenney will have packed up his carpet bag already and left for greener pastures.

David, the news for both King Jason and The Donald may be worse than you think. Here’s a link to the Guardian web site about coal miners in Appalachia losing faith in Trump’s promises:
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/12/west-virginia-appalachia-miners-green-new-deal

Things are getting so bad that ordinary people are wondering what the hell is going on with the weather. Then there’s crop losses, biodiversity losses, fisheries collapse, birds dying off, extreme-weather events raising insurance rates…. Imagine that. The first serious warnings were from insurance companies worried about losses. Of course, nobody noticed beyond “Damn insurance company raised my rates again.”

That’s human nature. Folks don’t think about the big problems until they are personally impacted. Our problem in Oilberduh is that our politicians are still in hock to the oil guys for their campaign funds. Heres another link, from rabble.ca this time. Turns out Canadians have become aware of the dangers of the climate emergency and are ready for action–IF repeat IF the governments will just lead:
http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/policy-note/2019/08/canadian-public-ready-climate-action-now-we-need-politics-catch

Unfortunately, we still have a slight majority in Oilberduh who won’t be convinced till 1) their house is destroyed by a tornado, 2) the wreckage is burned to ash by a wildfire and 3) the ashes are washed away by a flash flood. Then they can be really sure….

The thing about this poll, which is very interesting, doesn’t address the extent of the measures that will be required to make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Realistically, major lifestyle changes for many is going to be required and this is where I predict the largest failure will be with the political will.

What worries me, is that while those voters concerned about climate change have three options to choose from, the deniers — both the deniers it’s a real thing, and the deniers that we need do anything about it even if they accept that it is real — only have one. So, in October, votes for parties that propose real action on this file — including the Liberals’ although many have accused their plan of being inadequate or a sham — will be dissipated amongst those three parties, while voters who oppose any real action will flock to the ScheerCons, and so we run the real risk of a ScheerCon government.

Meanwhile, PM Justin Trudeau’s laser-focused aim at his own foot — did anyone say “SNC Lavalin” — is liable to give the Cons a boost in the polls just when they were starting to slide back to parity with the Grits … which, given the excess of Conservative support in the Prairies, where fewer voters live, meant that the crucial electoral battlegrounds of Atlantic Canada, Québec, Ontario & BC were more competitive. So, instead of a “hung Parliament” and the possibility of a Liberal-led minority government propped up by the NDP &/or Greens, we might actually see a Conservative plurality or even slim majority.

We are in deep shit as a country (sorry, David, for that fine Anglo-Saxon word from George Carlin’s famous list … feel free to bowdlerize it before posting if you prefer lol).

There was a caveat, though. We would only get the raise if we met certain performance benchmarks.

It turned out there was another catch as well. The benchmarks were a secret. And, no, we couldn’t be trusted with that information. Proprietary data, don’t ya know?

Anyway, six months passed. Some of us worked harder. Most of us, hard-bitten cynics who’d been through a few rodeos, didn’t bother. We did pretty good work just the same.

Eventually we were told that we hadn’t met the benchmark, whatever it was. There would be no raise. So sorry. Now get back to work.

We never did find out what we’d failed to achieve. The publisher in question has since passed on to his eternal reward, so we will never know.

I will note that the last time I saw Claudia Catteneo, soon to be supreme commander of Premier Jason Kenney’s “War Room,” was at the publisher’s funeral.

About that ‘Blue Ribbon’ panel of ‘experts’

I was thinking about this yesterday because the report of Mr. Kenney’s “Blue-Ribbon” Panel on the province’s finances, another institution of the New Alberta that requires quotation marks whenever it is mentioned in print, is scheduled to be handed to the government today.


“Blue-Ribbon” Panel chair Janice MacKinnon (Photo: CBC).

But like that long-ago assessment of the worthiness for a raise of those hard-working journalists — otherwise known by Conrad Black as “gangrenous limbs,” suitable for lopping off — its contents will remain a secret for some time as far as we members of the hoi polloi are concerned.

No, the Kenney Government will keep it close to its vest for at least another month while United Conservative Party propagandists figure out how to use the “findings” of the panel’s ideologically dependable members to justify big pay cuts for the province’s public employees, not to mention layoffs, service cuts and all the other typical policies plucked from the neoliberal austerity playbook.

As has been explained in this space before, since the mandate of the panel was to do a “deep dive” into the province’s books too quickly to be anything but shallow, and then come up with a formula for getting the books into the black in less than three years and eliminate debt, all without raising taxes or introducing a sales tax, there’s not much mystery about how they’re going to have to do it.

This would be true even if the chair of the so-called “expert panel” (the academic historian and former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon) had not already published her recommendations in a monograph with a well-known conservative economist: use legislation to roll back salaries.

Obviously, as Opposition Leader and former premier Rachel Notley observed, it doesn’t seem right for the Kenney Government to sit on this information after they have it, seeing as the actual data on which it’s based was prepared by public officials.

Equally obviously, though, nothing like what Ms. Notley suggests is going to happen because the Kenney Government, using our tax money to campaign vigorously for Andrew Scheer in all parts of the country, doesn’t want to do anything to queer the federal Conservative party’s chances.

And if the public in other provinces were to find out what Mr. Kenney plans to do here in Alberta, that would certainly be bad news for the federal Cons. So suggesting the contents of the report will be released in September, even in laundered form, is optimistic. Oct. 22, the day after the federal election, is more likely.

So far, all we get are misleading op-eds

Meanwhile, the ecosystem of partisan Conservative propaganda is gearing up to apply a full-court press to persuade us that the UCP is right and, as Margaret Thatcher used to say, There Is No Alternative.


Franco Terrazzano of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (Photo: Twitter).

We can expect to be inundated by a tsunami of dubious newspaper op-eds, editorials, public opinion surveys, think tank reports and social media trolling all emphasizing the venerable TINA formula.

First in, yesterday, was a misleading screed by the supposedly non-partisan Canadian Taxpayers Federation, an organization once led by Mr. Kenney himself. It was published by the allegedly unbiased Postmedia-owned Edmonton Sun. In it, CTF researcher Franco Terrazzano claimed that because the United Nurses of Alberta contract includes pay increases for experience, “the ‘pay freeze’ for nurses cost $17 million in 2017.”

This is a pretty tendentious argument, but I’ll give the CTF’s crack research team this much: their operatives can file a FOIP request with the best of us.

However, Mr. Terrazzano seems to have forgotten or omitted to mention that more than half the roughly 30,000 nurses represented by UNA are at the top of the pay scale and thus are no longer eligible to move up the salary grid.

He also forgot (or omitted) to mention that the information FOIPed by the CTF shows the current UNA collective agreement saved Alberta taxpayers about $56 million.

Oddly, he also didn’t mention the fact there’s a worldwide market for Registered Nurses, Registered Psychiatric Nurses, and teachers, another profession the CTF doesn’t seem to like very much judging from its frequent attacks on their pay. This means that if we don’t pay them the salaries they can command elsewhere, many of them will go elsewhere.

According to the government’s own figures, Alberta faces a shortage of more than 5,000 nurses in just six years. Consider the wisdom of attacking this group’s pay and job security if you think you might have to make use of the health care system one of these days.

The CTF’s well-established animus toward public employees and their unions apparently outweighs its market fundamentalist principles.

Interestingly, Mr. Terrazzano’s op-ed was the fifth to appear under his byline in the pages of Postmedia’s Alberta newspapers in the past three weeks. Funny how the restriction on the number of op-eds the U.S.-owned media corporation allows partisan groups to submit doesn’t affect the CTF.

But then, as was made clear by recent reports by canadalandshow.com and Press Progress, Postmedia is repositioning itself as a key part of the right-wing propaganda infrastructure, with some suggesting it intends to recast itself as a Canadian Fox News. So its dependence on sources like the CTF should not be a surprise","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Public sector unions, non-profits and severely normal Albertans will need to prepare for a Hong Kong-like response to deal with the UCP’s sugar-coated fascism.

Anyone who doubted that Jason Kenney was about to embark on a trip back-to-the-future, once he and his party were elected, are about to be hit smack in the face with an economic dose of Ralph Klein 2.0 reality.

Conservatives campaign on promises of cutting taxes and government waste while protecting and maintaining current levels of funding for essential services (Kenney’s vacuous Health Care Guarantee comes to mind), and then, under cover of some sort of crisis (real or exaggerated) claim with reluctance and hand-wringing that they have no choice but to go after workers, non-profits, health care, education and other public services to reduce the deficit and balance the budget — when other more humane means to achieving the same end are quickly discounted. Sad.

I am always amazed at how much we think a like. I will never forget the nurses bawling their eyes out in my office when Ralph Klein destroyed their careers. The same Ralph Klein who our family had known since the early 1960s. While he was campaigning to become premier his mother Flo told my mother that she didn’t think he was capable of running this province properly. Mum told her we shared her concerns and no one in her family had any intention f sporting him, even after family members had spent countless hours volunteering for the Lougheed and Getty governments, and had donated around $30,000. to their party. Then while Klein was ramming through his destructive polices, closing hospitals, closing 1,500 hospital beds, and cutting 5,000 nursing positions his estranged father Phil began voicing his displeasure. He was furious with what his son was doing. Even Klein’s own daughter Angie has pointed out that she had tried to vote him out of office like so many of us former conservatives, but the fools wouldn’t let us.

Now Kenney is promising another round of destruction and these same fools are believing every lie he feeds them. It’s only going to cost them a lot more money and likely some their lives, but they aren’t smart enough to understand that. I still remember the words of an 86 year old former University professor in 2000 who said to me “Now you know what happened in Germany in the 1930s, while we desperately tried to vote out the government the fools wouldn’t let us, I think you know how it turned out. If they had listened to us there would never have been a second world war”.

Alan K. Spiller: You are so correct. What the media also fails to mention is that Janice MacKinnon was part of a NDP government who had to clean up the damage done by the Saskatchewan Tories, led by Grant Devine. They also do not see how the Alberta PCs were so fiscally reckless, since Peter Lougheed was not the premier. Bad oil royalty rates for Alberta’s oil, draining the Heritage Fund to practically nothing, doing the most costliest scandals repeatedly, wasting millions and billions of dollars, privatizing and deregulating essential services, like utilities, magnifying their costs greatly, putting in a flat tax failure, leaving Alberta with a very costly infrastructure repair bill, from neglecting it for decades, and allowing oil companies to get away with not cleaning up their messes, leaving Albertans with a $260 billion cost to deal with this. The UCP will be the same, and likely worse.

Personally, I think blue ribbons are for the best pies and the hogs at the county fair, but perhaps Mr. Kenney the term because it seems slightly reassuring and he wanted to avoid using the word “expert” or “elite” which Conservatives so often like to deride. He probably could have also used “advisory”, but that would hint the final decision and responsibility rests with him and he is also trying to avoid responsibility or distance himself from it, in case the recommendations prove contentious or controversial.

This is another example of Mr. Kenney at his political best. He will distance himself somewhat from the recommendations and as usual gets others to do his dirtiest work for him. If something proves to be too politically contentious, he can even chose to ignore that particular recommendation. I suspect for the most part Mr. Kenney will go along with what is recommended, after all he carefully gave the panel a narrow mandate and hand picked the members, so I suspect they will mostly come up with the conclusions he wants anyways.

I think a key part of his strategy is to keep everything secret until the last minute, so that those affected by the cuts do not really have time to react. By the time they find out about things, they will be ready to be implemented. While it is a secret, the government will be preparing its implementation and communication plans.

I suppose planning in secret can be a tactical advantage, particularly for unpopular things. However, there is the disadvantage of not testing out public reaction in advance, in case there are some particularly poorly thought out or unpopular things in the recommendations or the implementation. Maybe a trial balloon or two will be floated on specific things they have a concern about, maybe not. In any event, I suspect most of the panels recommendations and the government’s implementation plan will remain secret until it is ready to be implemented. Mr. Kenney will probably have the hugest hissy fit if anything is leaked – it would be fun to watch that. Probably the recommendations will not be revealed until after the Federal election, so if Scheer loses or does not do as well as Conservatives hope, Kenney can remain blameless. Mr. Kenney seems to be emulating Mr. Harpers very secretive style of governing and so much for the grass roots now – the blue ribbon panel will just tell them what is good for them.

Re: having for any of us to make use of the health care system one of these days…..it brings to mind a UCP voting acquaintance of ours is going to have open heart surgery in a major Alberta city in a few hours. It comes to mind that this life, hopefully post-operatively, is largely in the hands of the very skilled and knowledgeable Cardiac Intensive Care United Nurses of Alberta Registered Nurses. What they have to know, and the training that it takes, for the average of us, is incredible, and 24/7.
Not only would these RNs, and the whole highly trained team, be reponsible for the cardiac and respiratory/ventilator observations and treatment, but for everything else in the most personal ways, i.e.urinary, gastrointestinal, emotional, family support…..the whole gamut. And yet, sadly, these folks vote for UCP politics which by all appearances, have no respect for United Nurses of Alberta members and their contract, let alone keeping them and their expertise here.
Again, it brings to the fore that how one votes and health care expectations once one is in the system, are intertwined. So if one’s expectations are not met in whichever way, perhaps due to shortstaffing or getting bumped for a more ill patient, not enough funding, etc., perhaps a suggestion would be, ‘talk to Jason Kenney,’ just like the Klein era when frontline health care professionals who took flak from patients and their families as a result of the Klein era health cutbacks finally, said…’talk to Ralph Klein.’ Again, many of them, then, left Canada for the USA who were thrilled to have us well-trained Canadian health professionals on board.
If it is thought that it cannot happen again, think again. The RN graduates of today are required to write, and pass, the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) exam for the licensing of Registered Nurses in both the United States and Canada, so going to the USA if things go backward again in Alberta for RNs, is a distinct possibility.

What frustrates me about this whole matter, is the phenomenon wherein voters elect a government devoted to slashing & burning public services, then protest when that same government then goes ahead & does it. We’re seeing the same thing over in DoFo’s Ontario, where people are screaming at the “PC” government over cuts that surprises nobody who was paying any attention before the election.

When are voters going to learn, elections have consequences? Don’t like what your new government is doing? MAYBE YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE VOTED FOR THEM!!! Gone are the days when you voted for a government, then lobbied them after they had power to try to change their minds, which was more likely to be effective with the old-style, non-ideological brokerage parties of yore. Nowadays, voters need to understand: be careful what you vote for, you just might get it.

100,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"It was a delight to talk with Andrew Weaver about Jason Kenney, details to follow soon",2019-08-22 01:14:00,David Climenhaga,,"VICTORIA, B.C. — If Jason Kenney’s ears were burning today, perhaps it was because of what Andrew Weaver had to say about him.

Mr. Kenney, as all readers of this blog should know as part of the price of admission, is now premier of Alberta; Dr. Weaver is the leader of British Columbia’s Green Party, which is rather the antithesis of Alberta’s United Conservatives but is influential because its three-member caucus holds the balance of power in the provincial Legislature.


W.A.C. Bennett’s office carpet (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The latter has some thoughts on the former, which will be revealed in this space in the fullness of time – once I have had the opportunity to sit down at a computer larger than a laptop and transcribe a recording. Soon, I promise.

At any rate, it was a delight to meet Dr. Weaver – who is, to paraphrase the way Ted Morton used to describe himself, what Alberta Conservatives should fear most: a climate scientist who is also a successful politician. Dr. Morton, of course, was Alberta’s finance minister under premier Ed Stelmach. He played a key role in driving premier Mr. Stelmach from office and is fairly described as the worst premier Alberta never had.


The building that contained Premier Bennett’s Victoria residence (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the meantime, it turns out, Dr. Weaver and I have a personal connection of sorts. My father once hired his father at the University of Victoria. I doubt this means I can take any personal credit for his success, but I’d be happy to do so just the same.

In the meantime, your blogger is taking a short break to chart the changes in his hometown, and AlbertaPolitics.ca will return to its normal publishing schedule shortly, which is the explanation for my recent silence and the real purpose of this short note to readers.

Those changes include full-size bucks with real antlers wandering along busy urban thoroughfares, and does accompanied their fawns devouring the roses throughout Dr. Weaver’s riding, apparently causing little distress among the humans with whom they share the city. This was unheard of back in the day, I can assure you.

While here, I have had the pleasure of treading on premier W.A.C. Bennett’s office carpet, which now fills the room of my temporary abode, and visiting his former Victoria residence for the nostalgic photo at right above.

I can assure you that this was where he lived because years ago I visited him there often to deliver his drugs.

I suppose such a statement requires explanation. In the late Sixties, I was a drugstore delivery boy sent out on my bicycle by a local pharmacy, entrusted with a $20 float to make change. It occurred to no one, including me, that anyone might abscond with either the drugs (all unsecured in my bicycle’s carrier rack) or the cash. (Did I mention times have changed?)

Premier Bennett had stomach ailment – no wonder, given his job – requiring a delivery every two weeks. He always tipped … one dime.

Well, that was back when a dime was worth about what a Loonie is now, maybe even a Twoonie. Certainly not a five-spot. Which is to say, in my informed opinion, the man was cheap. I suppose his supporters would say frugal.

I can tell you all this because there were no privacy laws to hide behind then.

And so, dear readers, more soon…","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">
  <p class=""p1"">VICTORIA, B.C. — If Jason Kenney’s ears were burning today, perhaps it was because of what Andrew Weaver had to say about him.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Kenney, as all readers of this blog should know as part of the price of admission, is now premier of Alberta; Dr. Weaver is the leader of British Columbia’s Green Party, which is rather the antithesis of Alberta’s United Conservatives but is influential because its three-member caucus holds the balance of power in the provincial Legislature<span class=""s1"">.</span></p>

<p class=""p1"">The latter has some thoughts on the former, which will be revealed in this space in the fullness of time – once I have had the opportunity to sit down at a computer larger than a laptop and transcribe a recording. Soon, I promise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At any rate, it was a delight to meet Dr. Weaver – who is, to paraphrase the way Ted Morton used to describe himself, what Alberta Conservatives should fear most: <i>a climate scientist who is also a successful politician.</i> Dr. Morton, of course, was Alberta’s finance minister under premier Ed Stelmach. He played a key role in driving premier Mr. Stelmach from office and is fairly described as the worst premier Alberta never had.</p>

While you’re enjoying your holiday in one of Canada’s nicest cities, say hi to my Ma for me: she lives down there now in NDP MP Murray Rankin’s riding —who won’t running this time and has left the riding polling neck and neck between the Dippers and the Greens. I implored her to vote NDP in the provincial election so’s to get rid of the corrupt BC Liberals (which we barely got done, but done it is!)—she confessed later that she voted Green anyways (the current Finance Minister and former NDP leader Carole James did win anyways). So, if you see her (tall, flamboyant, still getting cat-calls in her 88th year—no foolin’!) tell her for me it’s okay to vote Green this time—I want Green-leaning voters to vote Green only in ridings like this one where there’s a good chance the Green candidate will win instead of in ridings where their chances are much lower (to nonexistent) and a Green vote simply splits the nonCon vote.

Meanwhile, have a great vacation and safe return home. Bon Voyage!

This will not come as a complete surprise to anyone who follows either Alberta or British Columbia politics. Dr. Weaver, after all, is the leader of the B.C. Greens. He is also a climate scientist. In some circles, either of those factoids might be enough to make folks conclude they are natural enemies.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Just the same, when it comes to Premier Kenney, Dr. Weaver is scathing. “He’s just a bully,” he said dismissively in his office in the provincial Legislative Building in Victoria last week. “He’s a bombastic bully that I think is looking out for his own interests and not for the interests of Albertans or, frankly, broader Canadians.”

“I find him very confrontational. He’s not somebody that I personally think I can trust. Those are my views.”

Dr. Weaver compares Mr. Kenney’s vision unfavourably to that of Peter Lougheed — “an esteemed statesperson who … recognized that the wise approach to policy development would be to ensure that you put something aside in the good times.” Or Rachel Notley’s — “she was trying to navigate a very difficult situation whereby there are still a large number of Albertans who believe, and I would say foolishly, that their prosperity lies in extracting bitumen from the tarsands.”

A more apt comparison might be the leadership provided by Ralph Klein, Dr. Weaver suggests. “We start giving out Klein Bucks, frittering this away, and we now have a situation where there’s nothing left of the Alberta Heritage Fund.”

Anyway, Dr. Weaver continued, Mr. Kenney “wants to be prime minister of our country, and this is his pathway there. I think he’s actually taking Albertans back in time, which ultimately will not help them economically.”

The Green leader’s assessment of the future of a petroleum dependent Alberta is bleak: “Kinder Morgan Canada’s now divested itself. … Statoil’s gone. Total’s gone. Shell’s out. Where do I end?

“We know that the Alberta oilsands (require) some of the most expensive ways of getting oil out of the ground. We know that you must mix it with diluent to make it flow in pipes. We know that everybody in the world has discovered horizontal drilling technology, and we know, for example, that the Trans Mountain Pipeline was going to be approved to create a means to get Alberta diluted bitumen to the California refineries, but with the onset of horizontal fracking and the huge reserves in the Bakken shale, that market’s dried up.


Green Party of Canada Leader Elizabeth May (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“So we have no market left for the Alberta diluted bitumen. And for (Mr. Kenney) to suggest that we have to somehow get it to tidewater for economic growth …” Uncharacteristically, Dr. Weaver momentarily runs out of words. He shakes his head.

“The fact that Mr. Kenney continues to think that there is prosperity in this direction is fiscally foolish. I would think a good Conservative government would recognize that conservative fiscal policy plans ahead. It doesn’t try to continue down this path of race-for-the-bottom economics where we essentially eliminate royalties for our Crown resource, where we basically give subsidies and tax credits to these multinationals — who are looking out for their shareholders, not necessarily for the people here.”

Now you may think, who cares what Dr. Weaver thinks? After all, he’s the leader of a party with only three members in the B.C. Legislature. Mr. Kenney, by comparison, is the leader of the government of Canada’s richest provincial government and, if recent history is a guide anyway, among the country’s most influential for all the whining to the contrary. Mr. Kenney’s United Conservative Party has an overwhelming majority.

Ah, but those are the sort of small ironies that make history interesting. The Green Party of B.C. may have only three MLAs, Dr. Weaver included, but for the moment it holds the balance of power in the B.C. Legislature. And the Greens have chosen to uphold the B.C. NDP over the B.C. Liberals, who, despite their name, are really conservatives not all that far removed from Mr. Kenney’s worldview.

There will be an election in B.C. on or before Oct. 16, 2021, and that may change. But if the current federal auguries mean anything, that could very well result in more power than less for the MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, a provincial riding that shares territory with Green Party of Canada Leader Elizabeth May’s Saanich-Gulf Islands electoral district.

Ms. May and the federal Greens, it would appear, are on something of a roll. This would not be a bad thing for the B.C. Greens, even if Ms. May and Dr. Weaver don’t see eye to eye on every issue.

Certainly the NDP and the B.C. Greens don’t share the same views on a variety of environmental issues — for example, the rush to drill for gas in northeastern B.C., which Dr. Weaver sees as a public relations sleight of hand, since “we’re actually drilling for the condensates,” used to dilute bitumen, to ship the stuff from Alberta’s oilsands back through B.C. and on to whatever markets can be found for it. And “there isn’t an international market for this stuff,” he asserts.

As Dr. Weaver sees it, in the 2017 B.C. election, which resulted in the current delicate but surprisingly stable balance in the Legislature, that province’s environmental leaders lined up behind the NDP as their best bet.

But if the Canadian Green Wave persists though the Oct. 21 federal election, Dr. Weaver wouldn’t be the first political leader to ride another politician’s coattails to greater success.

In the mean time, his advice to Mr. Kenney is to have at it. Go ahead, by all means continue “saying outrageous, completely ridiculous things.”

Because outside the Prairies, certainly in B.C., he believes, no one is paying the kind of attention Premier Kenney wants.

“We’re only getting stronger because of his outrageous behaviour,” Dr. Weaver concluded. “It brings people to us. So keep it up! Every day you keep opening your mouth, more people come to the B.C. Greens!”","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Though we currently live in Ontario, I follow Alberta and British Columbia carefully & have family in both provinces – I have lived & worked in both as well & set much of my fiction (unpublished) in both. Sadly we don’t see your work in mainstream media.. but then, mainstream media often seems to deliver more and more superficial ‘news’ on polls, personalities, gossip, tragedy.. and weak advertising.

Thank you DC, a great column. I think the most important point made by Dr Weaver is his assertion that there is no Asian market for dilbit. Pipeline promoters have asked us to assume, without demonstrating, that there is such a market. The available evidence suggests otherwise. China seems to have no difficulty importing large quantities of high quality crude from Africa, Russia and the Middle East. I have never seen a pipeline proponent describe the capacity or interest of Asian refiners to handle dilbit. Dr Weaver seems to be right when he says there is no such market.

“the Trans Mountain Pipeline was going to be approved to create a means to get Alberta diluted bitumen to the California refineries, but with the onset of horizontal fracking and the huge reserves in the Bakken shale, that market’s dried up”

California’s complex high-conversion heavy oil refineries prefer heavy oil, especially at a discount. Indeed, California seems to be the primary destination for AB dilbit exported via the Trans Mountain Pipeline.
With the greatest concentration of heavy-oil refineries in the world, the U.S. Gulf Coast oil complex sources heavy oil primarily from Mexico, Venezuela (until recently), Colombia, and Alberta. Meanwhile, the U.S. is boosting exports of its own fracked light oil to Asia.
“Can Canada help fill the heavy oil shortage on the U.S. Gulf Coast?”
https://www.jwnenergy.com/article/2019/2/can-canada-help-fill-heavy-oil-shortage-us-gulf-coast/

“We’re only getting stronger because of [Kenney’s] outrageous behaviour”

“Progressive” leaders like Notley and Trudeau are far more effective in advancing Big Oil’s agenda. Notley’s signal achievement was to “push country-wide support for pipelines from 40% to 70%.” Something Kenney could never do. (And she’s still at it.) Jason Kenney’s bluster alienates people, leaving him impotent and isolated. Of course, their views on oilsands expansion and new export pipelines are practically indistinguishable.

I suspect if you took a poll of Albertans on Andrew Weaver he would probably poll even lower than his party. I don’t think Albertans really much care for what he thinks.

Perhaps it is true that the strident positions of the UCP and Federal Conservatives bolster support for the Greens and vice versa. There was a recent Federal poll with strange fluctuations of support where Conservative went up, while Green support went down and the other parties did not fluctuate much, which this sounds very odd is perhaps not. The Green Party is often described as leftist, but that is not entirely correct – a Conservative concerned about the environment may be as inclined or perhaps more so than a Liberal or NDPer with similar concerns to vote for the Greens. A better description would for the Greens more likely be a centrist party with a focus on environmental issues, or at least that seems to be how they try to sometimes portray themselves.

As much as I would like to give Kenney credit for the rise of the Greens, I suspect the credit goes more of the other way. The Greens are becoming more popular in Canada, due to an increasing world wide concern about the environment. Kenney got elected in Alberta in part due to the fear many here have of this change. So I think the converse is probably more true – every time Andrew Weaver speaks or acts, support for the UCP and Kenney goes up (at least in some parts of Alberta).

Dave I certainly agree on most of your points. Federally Green support is centred on Vancouver Island but I do think progressive voters who were hoodwinked into voting for Justin Trudeau in 2015 election won’t be fooled again.

As for Andrew Weaver, he is probably a very smart man, but I can’t support any party that believes the only solution is to switch to intermittent power sources such as wind and solar as our sole source of power. I have no problem if they want to use solar and wind when available backed up by natural gas now and hopefully nuclear in the future. But to promote a false in my opinion narrative that we can power our society 100% with solar and wind is just ridiculous. And yes Dave people like Andrew Weaver and Tsepora Berman caused to vote UCP in the last election. Enjoy your day.

That includes tax cuts, which will drive the province’s books deeper into the red, and cuts to services to help pay for the tax breaks.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

If the facts, such as they are known, suggest this program of austerity and pain is neither needed nor economically helpful, then let the facts be damned.

This was the message underlying yesterday’s peculiar First Quarter Fiscal Update by Finance Minister Travis Toews.

However, in the UCP’s defence, the party did campaign on this and won the support of a clear majority of Albertans. So no one can accuse the UCP of having a hidden agenda, exactly, although the unpleasant details of that agenda will have to remain under cover until after the Oct. 21 federal election. That way, they won’t spook Canadian voters in parts of the country less instinctively Conservative than Alberta enough to damage Mr. Kenney’s prime ministerial ambitions, which depend on federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer losing, but not too badly.

Still, it’s troubling that the UCP Government is basing its claims that things are so tough brutal measures are required to set them right on a report University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe yesterday called “the lightest quarterly update I’ve ever seen.”

Leastways, it would be troubling were Premier Kenney’s relationship to the truth not generally understood to be a casual one.

“Nothing new presented at all, just repeating what we already know about the path of Alberta’s debt levels under current policy,” Dr. Tombe said in another of a series of Tweets he posted on the topic.

Indeed, on the face of it, the government’s two-page report — which looks a bit as its first draft was scratched out on a couple of napkins in a Grande Prairie bar — suggests things are going almost exactly as the NDP government of Rachel Notley said they were supposed to go in its promised path to balance.

So much for Mr. Kenney’s notorious claim in July that “the NDP massively overstated revenues.” The premier went on in his interview with a Postmedia stenographer to say the NDP “were dishonest with Albertans and they fudged the numbers. They lied to Albertans about the economy and the revenues.”

The few facts included in Mr. Toews’s update suggest, unsurprisingly, that Mr. Kenney’s bombastic rhetoric was nothing but unadulterated Mundare kielbasa.

Total revenues? “Virtually identical,” in the words of the government’s own news release. Total expenses? Lower. Total capital expenses? Lower. Resource revenue? Up a little. Income tax revenue? Also up. Readers will get the idea. If they want the actual numbers, they’re neatly summarized in a chart in the update.


University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe (Screenshot of Calgary Chamber of Commerce video).

The point is, they’re pretty much exactly where the NDP said they’d be. I’ll leave it to readers to conclude who is actually doing the fudging.

Accordingly, having nothing in what he was required to report to justify his government’s austerity and tax-cutting plans, Mr. Toews emphasized the size of the provincial debt — never mind that the province also has by far the lowest debt-to-GDP rate in Canada, less than half that of the next lowest jurisdiction, British Columbia.

Mr. Toews also took pains yesterday to note than the government still believes its promised economic voodoo will work, and the tax cut snake oil will deliver bigger revenues.

Never mind this strategy fails everywhere it’s tried. It failed in Kansas, in Oklahoma, in Arizona, and Kentucky. It failed in Saskatchewan, and in British Columbia too. It failed nationwide, throughout the United States.

As economist Paul Krugman pointed out in a New York Times column last January about the claims made by the U.S. Republican Party about the supposed benefits of big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy (which are the same as Mr. Kenney’s ideas, presumably because that’s where he gets them), they rest “on research by … well, nobody. There isn’t any body of serious work supporting GOP tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Toews told the media yesterday: “We’re committed to delivering this corporate tax reduction in the timeframe we’ve proposed. We’ll be interested to monitor the results but we will implement this plan regardless.” (Emphasis added.)

Now, why would they do that?

Well, that’s the trick folks. As Dr. Krugman explained: Why do conservatives “adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data?” His answer: “Well, ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich, and it’s obvious.”

In other words, it’s a con. It’s always a disaster. But brace yourselves, fellow Albertans. You voted for it, and now you’re going to get it.

re: ‘But brace yourselves, fellow Albertans. You voted for it, and now you’re going to get it.’

UCP got the votes of 55% of the Albertans who voted. Which represents ~ 35% of AB voters ( 64% turnout).

Those voters are accountable for UCP’s ideological austerity for ordinary Albertans and the #TrumpKenney tax cuts for corporations.

Yeah, pedantic, fussy… perhaps.

But it’s a bit of a sick taste like drinking milk gone bad to be associated, even indirectly, with the UCP election win.

“You voted for it . . .”. Certainly Kenney’s ideological drift was there for everyone to see, but during the election I spoke with a surprising number of people who felt that since the merger of Wild Rose and the PCs, the UCP would now behave like a “big tent party”. We can say they were poor deluded fools, but how many of them formed part of Kenney’s 55%?

“You voted for it, and now you’re going to get it”. Let’s not dismiss the strength of the UCP’s mandate. Voter turnout was the highest in recent memory, and their share of the popular vote was far higher than that 55% figure outside the two big metro areas. I haven’t taken the time to plug every constituency’s results into a spreadsheet, but I did do that for the six constituencies of the Peace Country & northwestern Alberta — where I live — and the figures are revealing. Voter turnout overall was 72.8%, and the UCP’s share of the popular vote was 68.3% — i.e. more than a ⅔ majority — and in Grande Prairie-Wapiti, 80.4% of the electorate cast a ballot, giving our new Finance Minister — this is his seat — 74.2% of the votes cast.

To put those turnout numbers in perspective, in the previous three elections — 2008, 2012, & 2015 — turnout in the region was 31.9%, 45.0%, & 48.9% respectively. Again, in GP-Wapiti (under different boundaries), it was 26.6%, 42.4%, & 46.9%. So, an 80+% turnout in GP-Wapiti is unheard of.

The vote was also highly polarized, with 20.9% of the vote in this region going to the NDP, and only 8% to the Alberta Party. The Liberals were not a factor, not even having candidates in the majority of these seats.

So, the voters clearly fell for the UCP’s message of rage. I wonder whether that rage will be focused on them after four years of slash & burn …

Will be interesting to know how the education cuts will work when the school year has already started. Haven’t seen an increase in school fees over last year.

You have to stop quoting Krugman though not only does he write for the New York Times but has a pretty bad track record. The day he comes out and says the US should cut military spending and foreign wars is the day he will get some credibility. Likely also the day he no longer writes for the New York Times.

Putting that aside have you seen a so called conservative run economy that hasn’t been ruined? Remind me again how much debt Harper ran up? Oh the missed opportunity for not giving Rachel a second term…

The advantage of Krugman compared with many other economists is that he writes in a fashion that is comprehensible to lay readers. He is not unique in that regard, of course, but as a columnist for a major newspaper, plenty of material is readily at hand. DJC

Do you wonder why Alberta has no money? The answer is simple. The Alberta PCs, after Peter Lougheed left office, are TOTALLY responsible for virtually depleting Alberta’s finances, from multitudes of very costly scandals and neglect.
Since 1986, the Alberta PCs allowed rip off royalty rates for our oil, depriving Alberta of $200 billion. Since 1986, the Alberta PCs virtually depleted the Heritage Savings Trust Fund, leaving hardly anything in it. Ralph Klein used it for very costly scandals, like Alpac/Mitsubishi, to help finance his provincial election campaigns, and to help pay off the provincial debt/deficit.
Since 1986, the Alberta PCs did the most costliest scandals in Canada’s history.
The $67 million Gainers scandal, the Principle Trust scandal, blew $110 million on a metal smelting plant screwup, did the $600 million NovaTel scandal, did the now $5 billion, (and growing) Swan Hills waste treatment plant blunder, did the $180 million Miller West Pulp Mill debacle, did the $240 million MagCan scandal, blew almost $500 million, trying to bail out West Edmonton Mall, did the $125 million ambulance amalgamation screwup, did the $100 million A.I.S.H scandal, (which was complete with Ralph Klein and his colleagues, laughing at and mocking the handicapped on T.V), made us pay for the Stockwell Day defamation lawsuit costs, did the $400 million B.S.E bailout failure, did the $34.5 billion electricity deregulation disaster, did the $7 billion PPA debacle, that went with it, wasted $2 billion on carbon capture and storage, wasted money on luxury penthouse suites, wasted money on expensive plane flights, that had no extra passengers, did the $26 billion Northwest Upgrader fiasco, that had $9 billion in added costs, lost $10 billion on Alison Redford’s tobaccogate lawsuit scheme, which she did, and got away with, has expensive lawsuit costs against the Alberta government, in relation to the numerous deaths of foster children in Alberta, left Albertans with a $260 billion bill, to cleanup abandoned oil wells in Alberta, and so much more.
The Alberta PCs flat tax fiasco drained Alberta of billions of dollars in revenue from its coffers.
As of 2014, corporations in Alberta owed $1.1 billion in unpaid taxes. For many years prior, corporations in Alberta owed very large amounts of money in unpaid taxes, that the Alberta PCs failed to collect.
Ralph Klein laid off scores of nurses and teachers.
The Alberta PCs, after Peter Lougheed left office, badly neglected infrastructure in Alberta, leaving Alberta with a $26 billion infrastructure debt.
Jason Kenney had a hand in the CPC’s big mistakes.
The $35 billion income trust scandal, the robocalls scandal, (that Jason Kenney orchestrated), prorouged Parliament, failed to properly deal with Senate scandals and corruption, sold the Canadian Wheat Board to the Saudis, the CPC did not help get a pipeline built, that went to tidewater, when the CPC had a majority government, and had far superior oil prices, blew billions of dollars, trying to bail out the auto sector, increased the number of TFWs in Canada, (Jason Kenney was also behind that), and the CPC increased Canada’s debt to nearly $150 billion – $170 billion, all by themselves.
Oil prices sank in 2014, thanks to Saudi Arabia and America. Oil booms are finished. Jason Kenney’s corporate tax cuts have lost Alberta $4.5 billion. The UCP has already made over $13 billion in very costly mistakes.
How are these things not worse than the Federal Liberals giving $12 million to Loblaw’s for fridges/freezers? No wonder why Jason Kenney wants to do (foolish) cutbacks. Also, please share this to others.

I think when Albertans voted, many believed they would be geting modest cuts in spending. I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of surprised and upset people after the UCP’s fall financial masacre, like the IT contractor who in today’s news mentioned he supported them and is now finding out his contract is unexpectedly not being renewed.

I suppose the UCP hopes to make big cuts early and perhaps like a previous Premier hope oil and gas prices recover and they can try paper over the damage later with a spending spree just before the next election and hope voters forget about the cuts by then. For those hoping we would finally get off the PC boom/bust financial roller coaster, bad news – its back with a vengance, same old ride, just under a new UCP name.

Like many governments the UCP is trying to blame its pedecessor for a bad state of finances and as a justification for bigger cuts. Sometimes, this arguement is true, but unfortunately for the UCP in this case, they are having great difficult in getting the facts to support their story. It’s almost embarassing. The previous government did not leave a more bare cupboard than expected, but finances that were actually in a bit better shape than expected. However, that will not cause the UCP to rethink its plans. They long ago decided there would be big cuts and by george there will be, regardless of the facts. Too bad they weren’t very clear about all that before and during the provincial election.

As someone who has watched Kenney’s performance in Ottawa for years, I’ve always said he’s like a mean old junkyard dog that does a fine job of guarding the property from outside, but will bite the kids and wreck the china if you let him in the house. In short, Kenney was ‘safe’ for Albertans as long as he was far away. Bring him to Edmonton and he turns his venom onto his fellow Albertans in a way that denizens of the province are not used to from their Premier.

The austerity story caused by cutting taxes for the rich and the trickle-down theory has been mainstream Conservative horseshit since Maggie Thatcher berated her fellow citizens for being lazy sods, privatized the national wealth and ordered Ronnie Raygun in his advanced senilic debility to do the same thing. Thatcher had listened to economists who had astrology for a hobby, and thought that was a plan for the economy.

And the mantra gets repeated as if it were an inalterable fact by the dumbdroids of the right, including Kenney. harper had a go, the previous Saskatchewan dunce of a premier went to the Wall for it, and Schmoe stands firm on it along with the brain-dead Pallister next door, as did Cameron and May in Blighty and His Royal Borishness is betting to go at it even deeper. Trump did/does it.

Does anyone recognize an intellectual in that roll-call? You must be kidding. All were /are looking for a comfy well-fed retirement bankrolled by their rich “friends”. Doing anything to advance the fortunes of their broad citizenry never crossed their minds. All me me me and to hell with the plebs. Luckily for them, the plebs are so ill-informed and uninterested or caught up in slogans that these sleazebags get away with their rhetoric and subsequent actions. Even better for themselves as “community leaders”, they stand up and call the poorer lazy, inflating the opinions of the middle and upper classes of themselves and making them anti-union. Just to gild the lily for the better-off, temporary foreign workers are brought in to keep wage demands of the lower classes low. And a cutback of the minimum wage is another old dessicated prune of Conservative thought that is about as doctrinaire as cutting taxes for the rich. Who the hell wants their fellow citizens to make a living wage and contribute to the community, say Conservatives? After all god will provide.

Anybody who votes for Cons needs to get their head examined for signs of latent idiocy and addiction to reading tea leaves to foretell the future. If the hat fits, wear it.

I have a couple thoughts. In 1986 Don Getty had just came to power and Alberta’s oil industry had been gutted by the federal Liberal’s National Energy Program. He did lower royalty rates to make Alberta an attractive place for oil companies to invest and to bring jobs back to Alberta.

It is well documented that Alberta has sent $200 billion more to Ottawa in tax revenues than we have recieved back in federal transfers since 2000, you should mention that as well.

As far as Gainer’s goes the province eventually lost $209 million from its 1986 decision to offer a guaranteed loan to Peter Pocklington. The Swan Hills treatment facility has cost the province $440 million so far with a projected $165 million in projected future mediation costs. I could go through each of your examples and I am sure we would agree and disagree on numbers, the aforementioned did catch my eye though.

What your post does effectively point out is that government should stay out of investing in business, regardless of ideology, as just like private business not every investment decision is successful. Use hard earn tax payers money to provide services and not waste it in failed investments. Enjoy your day.

Farmer Brian: No. The Gainer’s scandal was $67 million. The rip off royalty rates for our oil since 1986, are what lost Alberta $200 billion. Oil companies were investing in Alberta, when Peter Lougheed accepted the proper oil royalty rates, without backing down. The Swan Hills waste treatment plant blunder has had annual bailouts since the very early 2000s, increasing the cost of it 10 times, to $5 billion. The incompetent UCP is the most capable of repeating the very bad things that the Alberta PCs did, after Peter Lougheed left office. Albertans who supported this, are the foolish ones. They forget how the PCs bankrupted Saskatchewan, and how Brian Mulroney governed so badly, on the federal level. Alberta’s financial problems can’t be blamed on Ottawa, even though Jason Kenney was in the CPC, when the current equalization structure was made, (that he constantly bellyaches about, to distract Albertans from the RCMP investigation against him), but with longstanding Conservative incompetence and mismanagement of our finances, which still exists today. The UCP has already cost Alberta over $13 billion. It’s a big shame.

Farmer Brian, amazing you don’t go back a little further during the early days when the oil sands were being developed and mention how the Federal Government, Alberta Government (Lougheed) and the Ontario Government invested heavily in the development of this resource which paid great royalty dividends to all investing Governments only to have Ralph Klein come along and giveaway these royalties away to the oil giants. Remeber Petro Canada, then owned by the Fed’s played a big role in the development of the oil sands only to sell it off for pennies per share.

It’s funny how many Albertans don’t recall that the Federal Government and it’s investments into our resources has helped Alberta over the years and only blame them for taking billions back in taxes.

91,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"‘Inauthentic activity’ on social media, abuse of progressive women in politics … is there a common thread here",2019-09-09 00:15:00,David Climenhaga,,"Is there a common thread running between reports Friday that a spike in “inauthentic activity” on social media just before the Alberta provincial election came from unidentified backers of the United Conservative Party and news stories Saturday about harassment of federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna?

It would be impossible to make an evidentiary link between the use of disinformation bots on social media by supporters of conservative political parties and violent threats directed at women candidates and activists.

Still, there’s something more than timing that suggests the stream of false stories designed to rile up the conservative base, often reposted by high-profile conservatives, and the toxic abuse that sometimes threatens to overwhelm women candidates and office holders, liberal ones in particular, both have their roots in the role social media plays in the ecosystem of conservative activism.

The analysis of the Alberta election by the Rapid Response Mechanism Canada made headlines when it identified “inauthentic, coordinated behaviour” not just by “known national far-right and hate group actors” but from within “the community of UCP supporters.”


Former Alberta premier Rachel Notley (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The group behind the report — an initiative of the G7 industrialized nations to coordinate identifying, preventing and responding to foreign efforts to subvert Western democracies — was very careful to note political parties could not be tied to this activity. But then, that’s why such accounts use anonymous bots, isn’t it?

It’s a shame the RRMC chose not to name the sources of this activity it had identified.

Still, the many connections among members of Canadian Conservative parties’ strategic brain trusts and social media organizations associated with false news, hateful speech, and “lock ’er up” rallies are pretty well understood.

Likewise, while the story about Ms. McKenna’s recent encounter with a threatening man calling her “Climate Barbie” — a term that may have been first tweeted by former Saskatchewan MP and Harper Government cabinet minister Gerry Ritz — is appalling, it’s not a particular surprise to anyone who has followed Alberta politics since the elections of Alison Redford and Rachel Notley.


Environmental activist Tzeporah Berman (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Of course, this is not just a Canadian phenomenon. But the use of violent language on social media, sometimes translating into actual violence, is becoming a particular problem for women in politics in North America, and, statistically, especially for those who hold progressive views.

It’s unlikely we’ll ever be told, but it would be interesting to be able to compare the statistics for threats against the current, male, Alberta premier — Jason Kenney — and his two recent female predecessors.

Add to this the propensity of prominent male conservatives not merely to be driven over the edge by women who disagree with them, but to think encouraging supporters to join in highly personal attacks on them is a legitimate political tactic.

Consider Mr. Kenney’s use of a poster labelling environmental activist Tzeporah Berman as “an enemy of the oilsands.”

“Since @JKenney announced his $30 million warroom to attack environmental advocates & this poster of me was held up at his press conference I have had death threats, misogynist & sexual attacks on social media,” Ms. Berman tweeted in June. “This is what that kind of fear mongering & hate does.”

Consider People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier’s recent tweets calling 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg “clearly mentally unstable,” which may have been a reference to her Asperger’s diagnosis or simply vituperation, and telling supporters “she should be denounced and attacked.”


Climate justice activist Emma Jackson (Photo: Twitter).

Or consider Matt Wolf, Mr. Kenney’s executive director of issues management, who published an unflattering screenshot of Edmonton climate justice activist Emma Jackson at an education rally, and accused her of working to “sabotage our economy” for her views on the environment.

“Cool to see Kenney’s Executive Director of Issues Management doxxing me on the internet, really love the way he captured my ‘before and after the UCP’ look,” Ms. Jackson shot back with better humour than Mr. Wolf deserved.

It’s unclear if Mr. Wolf is considered part of the premier’s war room, about which little has been heard lately, or if the quality of his social media comments reflect the tactics it is likely to deploy.

But it should by now be obvious to everyone the dangerous responses such attacks provoke among parts of the conservative base. This behaviour by people in responsible public positions needs to stop","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

This a counter-intelligence problem. Shadowy persons deeply involved with the UCP and provincial parties (I’m looking at you, Preston Manning and Stephen Harper) are part of a coordinated international campaign of subversion, corruption of elections and stochastic terrorism. They know exactly what they are doing. The only thing that could stop them the overwhelming power of the state, a power that they themselves have furthered with sweeping anti-terrorism legislation. It is inconceivable to me that an elected government would not make use of this power to squash these vermin. Their movements can be tracked, their money traced, their communications monitored. Keep that up for a few years, and it would be astonishing if they did not knit the rope with which to hang them.

From the CBC News website,”On September 2, Bernier posted a series of tweets in which he said Thunberg is ‘clearly unstable, not only autistic, but obsessive-compulsive eating disorder, depression and lethargy and she lives in a constant state of fear.’
After widespread pushback against Bernier’s remarks, the PPC leader took to Twitter today to claim he did not mean to attack Thunberg personally…”

“Clearly unstable, not only autistic, but obsessive-compulsive eating disorder, depression and lethargy and she lives in a constant state of fear.”
Not personal, Maxime? Wow.

People have lost the ability to effectively debate and express their opinions using words it is all emotion and very base behaviour. Look at the lock her up chant, originally aimed at Clinton by Trump supporters and some Bernie supporters. Both groups seemed to have legitimate reasons for calling for Clinton to be locked up. It then was used against Notley by people who we can only assume uncritically listen and watch to many far right radio and YouTube videos. No legitimate reason to call for her arrest existed, this was amplified on social media and used to dehumanize her and the NDP. Once the political opposition is dehumanized anything goes activating those who purely operate on emotion without intellectual capacity or restraint.
Phrases like conspiracy theorist and denier have been used to accomplish the same thing. The conspiracy theorist term has interesting origins from within US intelligence in an attempt to discredit those that questioned the Warren Commission report. Now it is used to dehumanize and marginalize anyone that questions the official government narrative, which we should all do. The denier label is used in a similar way to dehumanize anyone that questions the approved narrative of climate change. Denier is very obviously equated with Nazis and we all know it is alright to violently oppose Nazis Brad Pitt told us so in his movie. Remember that the next time you use these terms to describe your political opponents, who’s agenda are you spreading and what are the consequences of this dehumanization?

Pianists are people who play piano. Liars are people who lie. Deniers are people who deny. Simple.
There are examples of denial in any number of spheres. The association of the term with the Holocaust is not unique or privileged.

Deniers are immune to scientific evidence. Deniers invent spurious arguments to sow confusion and manufacture doubt. Deniers engage in disinformation campaigns and pander to wilful ignorance. Deniers invent scandals and hatch conspiracy theories. Deniers attack and threaten scientists. Deniers undermine public trust in scientific results and science as an institution.

The denialist playbook has been used over and over again by industry in order to protect profits: on leaded gas, acid rain, the ozone hole and CFCs, and, notoriously, tobacco. In some cases, the same “scientists” are hired to do “facsimile science”.

Around the world, tobacco companies have been taken to court for their deliberate campaigns of deception that increased harm, at huge cost to public health and the public purse.
The analog with climate change denial is clear. The fossil fuel industry has used many of the same tactics to sow doubt and confuse the public about global warming. And now fossil fuel companies like Exxon-Mobil are being sued.
Let’s call a spade a spade.

Another thing that really pi$$es me off about the attacks on Min. McKenna, and her government, aside from the vituperative nature of the trolling, is that that the same time that the Grits are being slagged by the right for allegedly stalling pipelines — as though any government could direct the courts to decide cases the way it would prefer — they are also being equally slagged by the left & the environmentalists … for building pipelines. I am hard pressed to know what they could do differently to please their critics, since their critics all seem to want exactly opposite things to happen.

As for the physical threats against Ms McKenna, I feel for her. I think she is an effective Cabinet Minister, and deserves at least a seat on the front bench of the next Liberal-led minority government … or a prominent critic assignment if they end up in Opposition.

Not too much of a surprise about all that inauthentic social media activity around the last Alberts election. The only surprise to me was that it was not noticed earlier. Some of those grassroots are as inauthentic as well a grassroots guarantee, a kamikaze candidate and his financial donors, the UCP leadership e-mail list … and so on. I could go on, but I think I have made my point. The UCP and some of its supporters are quite a hall of mirrors, where nothing is much as it seems.

The danger of unfiltered, unmoderated and unedited social media posts in damaging civil discourse in democratic countries is already well known and I suspect one of two things will happen. First, it will hopefully be somehow reined in or second people on other extremes will start to use it as shamelessly as those on the right are now.

I bet if the Internet worked better in Cuba, they’d have something like this too. And here in Alberta, anyone can join the Committee for the Defence of the Oilsands.

“At this stage of the process, I’m focused on information-gathering and fact finding, and that’s why it is critical that I hear from anyone who has valuable information to share,” said Steve Allan, the accountant from Calgary who’s commissioner of the inquiry that’s causing more chuckles on the West Coast than the original Steve Allen Show.


Rockefeller Center, New York City, where it all begins … (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In addition to the enviro-snitch line, the inquiry has a cool website that tells about what the commissioner will do, which apparently includes “planning the next steps of the inquiry,” an activity that may or may not include taking actual testimony from actual people.

But first, Commissioner Allan’s got side trips planned to Washington, Toronto, Vancouver and Haida Gwaii, all nice places where the inquiry has no authority whatsoever. He might want to bring along a hat and a pair of sunglasses for his visits to the latter two stopovers.

The inquiry has a FAQ page with answers to some of the pressing questions you may have, including the important news that “various parties are assisting the Commissioner,” nothing the inquiry does is subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and “the Commissioner may also pursue the attendance or testimony of persons located outside the province of Alberta.”

It’ll be interesting to see how that last bit works out, seeing as the inquiry has no jurisdiction outside the province of Alberta. Well, there’s no reason you can’t ask nicely!

The web page also suggests the commissioner won’t be available for media interviews — but don’t worry, folks, the website will be updated from time to time.

Oh, and about that Vivian Krause person … the Vancouver blogger accused by her critics of being a conspiracy theorist is important enough to rate her own FAQ on the inquiry website, but about all it says is that Mr. Allan will be conducting “a thorough, independent and impartial assessment of the relevance and value of Ms. Krause’s work.” What the heck kind of a vote of confidence is that?

You’d best mind your manners Mr. Blogger. Commissioner Allan could see to it you are shunned at the supermarket and banished to the end of the line at Mary Brown’s Chicken & Taters. And like the showman Steve Allen, he might perform a piano solo in Hogtown questioning your denial that you were ever a member of the Green Party. No way I’d miss that.

Environmentalists everywhere oppose fossil fuel expansion, new pipelines, and climate disaster. Surprise!

Funding from U.S. foundations represented a small fraction of Canadian ENGOs’ budgets. The bulk of their funding comes from ordinary Canadians.
Deprived of U.S. foundation funding, would Canadian ENGOs have acted any differently? Would Canadian ENGOs support oilsands and pipelines? Pure fantasy.
Climate change is a global issue. Why would ENGOs refuse U.S. funding for work they were already doing?

Foreign funding flows to both sides of the oilsands battle. Compared to the bottomless resources of govt, huge multi-national corporations, and the media, the resources of Canadian ENGOs are a drop in the bucket. Why should green groups fight the global climate battle against Big Oil with one hand tied behind their back?
Krause fails to show that U.S. funding for Canadian ENGOs was the sole or main cause of delays and cancellations.

U.S. foundations provide far more funding to U.S. ENGOs to oppose U.S. pipelines and projects.
Krause claims there is no activist resistance to pipelines in the U.S. In fact, U.S. ENGOs and indigenous groups advocate climate action and vigorously oppose interstate pipelines throughout the U.S. U.S. interstate pipeline projects receive huge pushback.

There! I just saved Jason Kenney and AB taxpayers $2.5 million.

What new hot mess have you uncovered now Mr. Climenhaga? If this Orwellian clusterf*ck weren’t so hilarious, it would be cause for “recall legislation” (whatever happened to that legislative Kenney Election Platform promise anyway?)

If it is a snitch line that the moribund new UCP party craves — why not a snitch line establishing sightings of duly elected and handsomely paid UCP members, cavorting out-of-province, with CPC candidates running in the next federal election. My guess is that would be more beneficial than a McCarthyesque report by an anti-enviro hanging judge trying to extract any and all fiction from deluded conservative conspiracy theorists.

Well, I have a full disclosure too. My wife is a bird watcher and wildflower aficionado. I believe she has conspired with foreign sounding thingies to land-lock Alberta oil. I don’t know their first names, but their last names are Purcell, Monashee, Selkirk, Cascade, and a couple called Rocky and Coastal (dirty hippies I bet). There are also three sisters involved who call themselves “La Prairies” and their brother who goes by the name of “Canadian Shield.”
This group’s doctrine is called “transportation economics” and they use it to justify land-locking the tar we all love so much. I renounce them and all their works.

Somebody buy this Allan guy a subscription to the Calgary Sun or maybe the Herald, it might just save us a lot of time and money. Or maybe not, there is plenty of “information” floating out there, but the credibility of it, even in some supposedly credible Alberta news media is dubious.

I have a feeling the more this goes on, the more Mr. Allan will potentially be chasing rabbits down ever more questionable rabbit holes. I think it will be quite an undertaking for him to put a facade of reputability on this exercise. The danger is that others outside Alberta start to notice and I think when we start to become the laughingstock or punch line elsewhere, there could start to be a blow back in Alberta.

Yes, Alberta has its interests in perpetuating the existing energy industry, but even we know there are limits. For instance, a couple of elections ago, we equivocated on electing a woman as premier, who at the time was equivocating on climate change denial. I think we realized that could be counter productive, if we wanted to be taken seriously at all.

Yes, it might seem like the world is conspiring against us at times, but it is events and circumstances, not the Rockefellers or some other US foundations that are the cause of all our grief. Perhaps I should not underestimate Mr. Allan and maybe he will actually put together a report that ultimately explains that to Albertans, but I don’t think that is the direction his political bosses have laid out, or really want him to go in.

What else can we say about Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s bizarre 2,330-word public letter yesterday to Alex Neve of Amnesty International Canada, attacking Mr. Neve, the organization he leads, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, Iran, the Soviet Union, the Saudi royal family, the Qatari royal family, the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, OPEC, “eco-colonialists,” the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Rockefeller Family, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, Canadian environmentalist Tzeporah Berman, the Tar Sands Campaign, and maybe the Internet too?


Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International, who obviously knows how to get up Mr. Kenney’s sensitive nose (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Well … first this: Sarcasm does not become a premier.

Especially, if I may be so bold, a Conservative premier.

There was a day when Alberta’s Progressive Conservative premiers ignored what they deemed to be unfair or unreasonable criticism with dignified, even stately, silence. Which, more often than not, was any criticism at all. For most of 44 years, this worked magnificently.

Ignoring criticism is not our hypersensitive premier’s thing, obviously.

Apparently stung to the core by Mr. Neve’s thoughtful open letter Tuesday about the dangers he sees with the United Conservative Party’s strategy of “war rooms” and inquiries that decide first and interrogate witnesses later, Mr. Kenney responded with a full-blown squalling tantrum, a malediction worthy of one of those poor nuts who in the normal course of governing a province like Alberta send their loopy fulminations to the politicians who occupy Mr. Kenney’s current office.


Canadian environmentalist Tzeporah Berman, just one name on Mr. Kenney’s growing Enemies List (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Instead of strategic dignity, Mr. Kenney opted for a barrage of bitterness and sarcasm — all published on the official government website.

“I understand it must be hard for you,” he derisively told Mr. Neve as if they were arguing on the steps of the Legislature. “When you look around the world and see the rise of authoritarian governments, civil war, human trafficking, genocide, and other gross violations of human rights, it must be a tall order to find something, anything to denounce here in our gelid but placid Dominion.”

Alas, our placid Dominion along with the rest of the planet is becoming less gelid by the minute, and it turns out that’s a problem raised by Mr. Neve in his letter that Mr. Kenney and his government would really prefer not to confront. So a strategy of drawing more attention to what Mr. Neve had to say, and, inevitably, engaging more readers who may agree with the secretary general of Amnesty International Canada, is probably not the best way to achieve the premier’s objectives.

Better from Mr. Kenney’s perspective, perhaps, to have ignored Mr. Neve’s criticism with a hyperboreal chill worthy of Peter Lougheed, who knew how to do that sort of thing. If I were the premier, I’d leave sarcasm to what he calls Bohemian Marxists with blogs!

Well, this is what happens when a thin-skinned control freak gets into the premier’s office and makes his communications staff hand over the password to the provincial website’s content management system!

And who can doubt Mr. Kenney wrote this by himself? It has the sophomoric ring of a man, thesaurus in hand, who left college in a huff and privately wishes he hadn’t. Well, he has the National Post fooled, at least. It re-published the entire thing for the edification of the nation.


Former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, who’s looking a little bilious lately (Photo: Screenshot of Conservative Party of Canada video).

It’s becoming glaringly obvious that Mr. Kenney, though a campaigner of undoubted talent, is as batty as Donald Trump, and possibly less charming! Whatever role he played to the Court of Stephen Harper (jester?) it couldn’t have been his thoughtful counsel on diplomacy or conciliation the boss was seeking out.

In order to harness his energy and talent without smashing the crockery, Mr. Harper clearly kept him firmly under his thumb. It must have been exhausting! No wonder the former Conservative prime minister looks a little bilious of late.

Mr. Kenney has now revealed a conspiratorial turn of mind that doesn’t seem entirely healthy, and for which the traditional journalistic prescription is to brusquely instruct the afflicted to go forth in search of a tinfoil cap.

“As for the rest of your accusations and insinuations,” the premier screeched at Mr. Neve, “they only make sense if you deny that there is a well-funded campaign against Alberta’s natural resource industry and a concomitant need to rebut it. This would be the campaign that you dismiss as ‘vague conspiracy theories about the hidden goals of U.S. based foundations.’ I assure that if their goals are hidden it is because they have worked hard to keep them that way.” (Emphasis added.)

This is, shall we say … unlikely, undignified and possibly unhinged.

And don’t forget that Mr. Kenney is the man federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked to replace Doug Ford on the campaign trail because the Ontario premier nowadays arouses too much hostility among the vote-rich province’s citizenry. The mind reels.

It’s hard to imagine to whom this denunciation is supposed to appeal. The bitterest denizens of Calgary’s oil towers, one supposes. The truly desperate who wish the inevitable decline of fossil fuels as a commodity could be staved off another century, perhaps.

The premier obviously knows many Canadians regard Mr. Neve as a thoughtful man, and Amnesty International remains a respected organization, even though the premier is no longer president of his high school Amnesty club. Nothing in his screed changes that.

Indeed, the secretary general of AI Canada can now safely rest his case, confident the jury’s on his side.

I would say our Premier is becoming a bit cranky. Perhaps he thought winning the Premiership would bring him more adulation or maybe unexpected criticism from this particular organization hit a raw nerve. Whatever the case, it seems to have provoked quite a reaction.

My observation is Mr. Kenney is at his best in three situations. One is opposition. In some ways he already acts more like the Federal Conservative leader than Scheer. A second is talking to the true believers and a third is with a less partisan, but somewhat friendly crowd, lets call that the curry in a hurry crowd. Of course, Mr. Harper couldn’t give him the first role when in government and the second had some dangers, so he kept him as busy as possible with the third role.

Now Mr. Kenney is back in government and not in a best supporting role, but a buck stops here role. If his steathily planned cuts go sideways and I think they probably will, you know whose popularity will take a hit. It will not be Harper, Notley or Trudeau who Albertans will blame.

Mr. Kenney’s thin skinned and over the top response may go over ok in Alberta, where mainstream newspapers often publish stories about environmentalist conspiracies. However, a few more of these diatribes and more people outside Alberta will start to look at Mr. Kenney as possibly being a bit kooky in an Aberhart kind of way. That will not be helpful for Mr. Kenney’s chances if he decides to throw his hat in the ring when the Federal Conservatives have the need to replace Scheer.

No need for an inquiry, I guess. Premier Kenney has already made up his mind.
Kenney’s snide rant is full of errors. Vivian Krause’s morass of fallacies stand out. Kenney has taken on Krause’s conspiracy theory lock, stock, and barrel.
Kenney completely dismisses homegrown opposition, including First Nations opposition, to oilsands expansion and pipelines. According to him, it’s all about foreign billionaires and foreign-funded special interests.

Never mind that the funding provided by U.S. foundations like Tides represented a small fraction of Canadian ENGOs’ budgets. Most of them get most of their funding dollars from ordinary Canadians from coast to coast.
Never mind that U.S. foundations provide far more funding to U.S. ENGOs to oppose U.S. pipelines and projects.

Without U.S. foundation funding, would Canadian ENGOs have acted any differently? Would Canadian ENGOs support oilsands and pipelines? Pure fantasy.
Climate change is a global issue. Why would ENGOs refuse U.S. funding for work they were already doing?

If Kenney already has all the answers, he could save taxpayers $2.5 million and cancel his pointless inquiry.

Kenney, the gift that keeps on giving, squawk, splutter, screech, turn red with utter outrage.

That list of countries and people he derided was so long, I expected to see DJC’s name in it. But apparently he’s already been tagged as a Bohemian Marxist. If the plump cherub of change makes it down Halifax way to prop up Down Home Andy trying to give a halting speech from illegible notes, I shall have to put on my best suit and infiltrate the proceedings. Did it almost fifty years ago in Greece, when right wing colonels were in charge. I met one and had a lovely personal high speed cabin cruiser boat tour of Piraeus harbour complete with much derision for the hoi polloi on shore. “That’s why we have live soccer matches on TV every day – keeps ’em happy” My backpack I had left at a friend’s before showing up. Since all the other Western youth backpacking Greece had long hair, beards and ratty demims, they got hassled. There’s a lot more to the overall story, but another time. Heh, heh. Yup, if you can knot a decent tie you too can meet Cons to see how their minds tick. They’ll be more than forthcoming if they think you’re one of them.

I see harper has now physically styled himself after Conrad Black, a not unreasonable clone actually, a physical hologram of that unbiased historian/author of past Great Battles, where none of the Big Names ever met HIS standards. Perish the thought. But still, to preserve the higher plane of consciousness a first-rate Conservative mind possesses, one must support lesser lights’ mediocre performances now and then, no matter how distasteful the task is. I rather think Kenney looks vulnerable to being teased and provoked by a wily Opposition. Apparently an over-the-top unreasonable rant can be rustled up in an instant. On cue, as it were. Well! I’m sure a wise old BARON Black of Crossharbour would counsel a cup of tea and some nice chocolate biccies, followed by two Valium several hours before composing a response in future. “Calm down, Keeney! Or is it Kenney? One forgets small details. You’re queering the pitch! Unacceptable for one supposedly of the clan.”, I imagine him advising in a voice as hard as ice.

That might keep our budding demagogue from again yelling so soon into his tenure. Otherwise, we’ve all got to put up with trash talk for ever, I suppose.

Rather than tolerating opposing opinion Mr Kenny is following the example of the American President. First, make an unreasonable and contentious statement. Then when there is pushback ratchet up the indignation, the resentment and attack and attack again. Never admit there is any other position but your own.

The Premier forgets he is meant to represent all Albertans, not just the people who think confrontation is good government.

Embarrassing! Dangerous. I wonder how Kenny’s mania is assessed in the UCP caucus and donor boardrooms? He won the election; we can take it from here? Funnily enough, it’s time to chain your pit bull before you have to pull him off your kids.

Keep in mind that for all Kenney’s posturing, this is a man who is thinking about leaving Alberta’s hinterlands behind and returning to gold paved roads of Ottawa. The PMO beckons and Kenney feels destined to seize that which he was denied so unceremoniously. https://thewalrus.ca/true-blue/

Having forged a political party in his own image, Kenney can now toss the better-get-married-first requirement of conservative leadership and demand his place in the sun.

And Canadian conservatives will be stupid enough to give it to him, too.

Speaking of snitch lines…

The tables are starting to turn on fossil fuel companies as startling information comes to light that O & G companies knew for decades, based on their own scientific analysis, of the threat fossil fuels posed to the world.

“Nine cities and counties, from New York to San Francisco, have sued major fossil fuel companies, seeking compensation for climate change damages. And determined children have filed lawsuits against the federal government and various state governments, claiming the governments have an obligation to safeguard the environment.” — David Hasemyer (full article below)

One of them, sad to say, is still the most likely person to emerge as prime minister of Canada after Oct. 21.


Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Andre Forget, Flickr).

The former dressed up in blackface at an age and a moment in history when there was no longer any possible excuse for a decent adult to do that. Then he hid it from his own Liberal Party and failed to make an honest disclosure and apology at a time and place the resulting furor could have been managed.

The latter, having failed repeatedly to curb the worst tendencies of his own Conservative MPs and strategists, and after hanging around himself with Yellow Vest creeps and white nationalists, said he’ll stand by his racist and homophobic candidates as long as they say they’re sorry. But no apology is acceptable when it comes to his chief opponent.

“I accept the fact that people make mistakes in the past and can own up to that and accept that,” Mr. Scheer said recently. Except when he doesn’t accept it, of course.

To give Mr. Trudeau such credit as we can, at least his apologies have sounded sincere, which is more than you can say for some of Mr. Scheer’s forgiven candidates.


NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

This is particularly distressing because for most progressive Canadians two other party leaders — Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party and Elizabeth May of the Green Party — both look better in comparison today, but still don’t have much chance of forming government.

It’s all very well for deeply committed partisans to condemn strategic voting, but for most progressive Canadians it’s a harsh reality of Canada’s first-past-the-post system, which Mr. Trudeau promised to reform, and didn’t.

It’s even more distressing because we understand the bleak reality that for all the Liberals’ and their leader’s multitude of sins, another Conservative government would still do far more harm to the country we love.

Which brings us to the next calculation, what the impact of this uproar will be on Mr. Trudeau’s fortunes in the election on Oct. 21?

When the photo bomb dropped, Mr. Trudeau’s party and Mr. Scheer’s were neck and neck in most polls, for whatever that’s worth. The Liberals were deemed by most commentators to have the most “efficient” vote, and therefore a slight edge.

Does this upset that calculation? Or, as a family member living abroad asked me this afternoon, “is Trudeau sunk?”

Professional prognosticators employed by mainstream media seem to be tilting toward the analysis it will, and he is.


The late Jack Layton, leader of the NDP in 2011 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I am not so sure for the following reasons:
First, whether or not Mr. Trudeau recovers doesn’t really have much to do with the specific details of the trouble he’s got himself into.

If Canadians are sick of him, he’s sunk.

If they’re not sick of him, the crisis will be over for all intents and purposes in a couple of days, and he’s not sunk.

And it’s not yet clear, especially given the realistic alternatives, if Canadians are sick of him.

As bad as this is for the Liberals, it’s better that it happened now than in two weeks, which makes me wonder, seriously, who leaked the incriminating high school annual photo to Time Magazine?


Green Party Leader Elizabeth May (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The Conservatives, of course, will do their best to keep this issue front and centre, even if it turns out most non-Conservative voters say pfffft. So their media narrative will be that he’s sunk.

It’s funny to say this will be hard to explain to your racist uncle who hates the Trudeaus, but he’s probably going to vote Conservative anyway, and the party, understandably, will do its best to shore up such voters.

The NDP want their missing mojo back, so their narrative will be similar to that of the Conservatives.

As for the Greens, despite Ms. May’s tweet she was “deeply shocked” at the revelation, so far their narrative is not really clear. Some political calculations are being made there, I’d guess.

Media will continue to push this too — not just because it’s a good story, although it is, but because both Postmedia and the Globe and Mail have faced recent criticism about offensive commentary in their pages and this is an excellent opportunity to, as they say, restore their virginity.

So what will Canadians decide? Nobody really knows at this instant, but the herd instinct will be clear soon enough. My hot-take guess is it will be less than the Conservatives hope or the media predicts.

Remember back in 2011 when it looked as if the NDP was on a roll and then a story appeared saying leader Jack Layton had been “found” by police in a rub-and-tug massage parlour 15 years before?

The night the news broke, I thought, “That’s it. He’s done.”

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The next day Mr. Layton’s approval ratings jumped. Maybe that was because voters thought the report was just a sleazy Conservative smear. Maybe it was because they thought it didn’t matter.

Whatever their reasons were, it made no difference. The Orange Wave reached its highest crest under Mr. Layton’s leadership and, had he not died of cancer later that year after briefly serving as Opposition leader, he might well be running for his second term as prime minister by now.

Is this situation analogous? Not exactly. But when it comes to the imponderables of political calculations, what matters is how voters react.

And as Harold Wilson, the Labour politician who was Britain’s prime minister from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976, famously and accurately observed: “A week is a long time in politics.”

That the NDP doesn’t have a shot is a self reinforcing lie, there is more then enough voters willing to vote NDP. You can just look at how people are leaning right now, the more important numbers are how big of a pool of potential voters each party has, and the NDPs pool is big enough to win this election.

The hypocrisy of the opposition leader? I would say that it is Justin Trudeau that is guilty of hypocrisy! The federal Liberal’s have a war room dedicated to digging up dirt on opposition candidates. They wanted 1 conservative candidate turfed for something he said in high school. But when it comes to Justin Trudeau, well he expects to get away with an apology. Look at the groping incident that happened 18 years ago in B.C. this was Justin’s response: “People experience things differently and we have to be more thoughtful.” If that was one of his MP’s that person would have been turfed. So back to the black face incident of today, if that was any other MP they would be done, if it was Andrew Scheer he would have been forced to resign in the first 24 hrs, but no it is Justin Trudeau he just apologizes and moves on. The SNC-Lavelin affair demonstrated that he has no ethical compass, this incident shows he has no morals and yet David you still prefer him as our next Prime Minister?!?! As a Canadian I will be embarrassed if he continues to represent our country on the world stage. Enjoy your day.

While I don’t disagree with the seriousness of the incident and certainly do agree it was racist behaviour, I also know that Trudeau has not been racist in his political life so far or his personal afaik. He immediately apologized and did not try to sugar coat any of it. He owned it in other words.

Contrast that with the homophobic and discriminatory words around the LBGT+ community from Scheer who still will not apologize when asked twice recently.

I know who I find more upfront and ethical.

Time magazine (Time), a U.S. company, why would they be meddling and influencing the Canadian election at this time, and we are worried about Russian meddling and influencing a Canadian election. And why did Time wait until the Canadian election was called to publicize this story when it appears they could have done so long ago. I wonder how much money Time has contributed and to which Political parties and to name them. I doubt they have the intestinal fortitude to do so. What Trudeau has done in the past was totally wrong however if he had done so while seeking office or leadership for the Liberal party this story would be totally troublesome. I think there is more to this story and Time plus other Media have some explaining to do how and why they broke this story.

This story seems to serve as the current daily affirmation that we are doomed. Given the contexts of Trudeau’s shennanigans, there is essentially no evidence that his behaviour was a manifestation of racism. We are living in an era when racists are feeling confident enough to publicly espouse their infantile and illogical viewpoints in very clear statements, frequently with little or no political consequences. Secularism and the belief in human equality are being squeezed out of the minds of folks in the industrialized nations via the machinations of the nexus of greed and superstition that holds together the forces of neoliberalism and imperialism. I find it sadly amusing that the leader of NDP, once nominal heirs to the mantle of CCF, wears a magic hat and three thousand dollars worth of clothing when he addresses the public. As a secular humanist, I long ago rejected the trappings of my ancestral superstitions, what with all the molesting, repression and such, and I can’t “get behind” a leader in 2019 who is an adherent to this atavism:“In 1699 at the first Amrit Sanchar (ceremony), Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh Guru, bestowed the honor for Sikhs to wear the five articles of faith at all times with a promise that by following the teachings of the Guru and keeping ourselves distinct we would have his undying power and support.”
https://www.sikhdharma.org/khalsa-wearing-five-ks/

H.L. Mencken, an actual racist, was nevertheless entirely accurate in his characterization of our acceptance of absurd leadership in a “democracy”:“It is as if a hungry man, set before a banquet prepared by master cooks and covering a table an acre in area, should turn his back upon the feast and stay his stomach by catching and eating flies.”

Well, it could be worse. Consider the Dutch and their Christmas icon “Black Peter.” In their very popular mythology Black Peter is a Spanish Moor who helps St. Nicholas by going down the chimneys to deliver the presents. The BBC reports that Black Peter is still so popular that the Dutch right wing occasionally resorts to violence against those suggesting the icon is obsolete.

So dressing up as a cartoon character hardly seems in the same league as the collection of book burning bigots supporting the UCP/Cons, most of whom I’ll wager dressed up as gun toting cowboys.

Yeah, good call Kang!
The last time I played dress-up and it meant something, more than a half-century ago, it was as a cowboy out to (pretend) kill the Indians.

To see the middle-aged bozo’s wandering around in their brand new store bought cowboy gear just gives me the willies. How much more obvious do they have to be to show their racism?

And I think Murphy has nailed it!
The caught (in the head-lights) and captured (and trussed up like a pig in a poke) MSM announcers have going on non-stop about racist “makeup” – what the hell is racist makeup? What kinda nonsense is this?
Wearing some clothing or some jewelry or other accoutrements is offensive to some people. So what else is new? Is there a list of official and sanctified clothing and symbols? How about official and sanctified greetings? or comments about leadership? C’mon down George Orwell and Eugène Ionesco!

A liberal democratic society IS tolerant of other’s tastes, preference, thoughts and ways of life. Not just ‘should be’ but is!
If we are not living in and supporting a liberal democratic society, then what are we promoting?

“The NDP want their missing mojo back, so their narrative will be similar to that of the Conservatives.” I hope you’re wrong about this, David. This blackface controversy is quite simply a gift to the NDP, if they have the smarts to take proper advantage of it, which they likely won’t. Personally, I don’t believe Trudeau is a racist; he’s just not as sensitive to discrimination issues as he should be, thanks to his elitist upbringing. In today’s rabble, Karl Nerenberg observes that “the current Liberal government opened the door to Syrian refugees; restored health care for all refugee claimants; ended the Harper government’s restrictive measures on family reunification for refugees and immigrants; and even tacitly encouraged refugees from all over the world, who are fearful of their reception in Trump’s U.S., to enter Canada through the back door, as it were, thus getting around the safe third-country agreement Canada has with the U.S.” All positive accomplishments, which Jagmeet should commend while at the same time emphasizing that they don’t go far enough, and that an NDP government would take discrimination seriously and move to end it (especially with respect to our Indigenous peoples). He should take the high road, act dignified, and restrain himself from criticizing Trudeau personally as Scheer has done and will continue to do. Maybe even the media would then start to take him seriously.

Lets see, we have the UK which is in a terrible Brexit mess, which each of the last 3 PM’s there have contributed, a US President who seems to do or say something offensive to many, at least once a week over the last several years and a Premier in Alberta who may or may not be under investigation for financial and voting irregularities in his party’s leadership race and we are supposed to be outraged about pictures of Mr. Trudeau from around a couple decades or so. Sorry, but I think my outrage meter is broken and has been for some time, there has already been far too much crap. I suspect for the most part those that support Mr. Trudeau will continue to do so, perhaps with further reservations, the honeymoon is obviously over and has been for some time, and those that do not support Mr. Trudeau will just add this to their list of reasons for why they do not.

Conservatives have been reminding us for years that before Mr. Trudeau got into politics he was a drama teacher, I think the implication being that they do not think being a teacher, particularly a drama teacher is a worthy profession or serious enough to qualify one to be a political leader. I suppose, when you combine a love of the dramatic or theater, combine it with an enthusiasm for costumes and ready access to makeup, it can be come a potential political weapon of self destruction, as it has in this case. At least in one case, I don’t think Mr. Trudeau’s intent was to mock people of colour, but an overzealous desire to make a costume as authentic as possible.

It is not surprising this picture appeared in a US publication. Canada does not have the history of blackface that the US does, in fact as a country we have different and better history of race, relations, although not perfect. Canada never had slavery as a country, although it did exist in the British colonial period for some time. We also do not have the history of British colonial relations that the UK does with all its baggage. So when people for instance in the US or the UK see this picture, they view it through the lens of their own race relations and react accordingly. Of course, US attitudes also seep into Canada and most of us have seen pictures from the US in recent times of politicians in places like Virginia who had blackface in a different place and situation.

I suspect the picture was leaked to the US publication by Conservatives who were getting tired of having things they said in the past being dug up to imply they were racists or homophobes and who couldn’t respond adequately to those charges. The tactic is somewhat familiar to one used by some US conservatives in their last presidential election. If you can’t make yourself look good, bring your opponent down to your level.

It may be successful or perhaps not. Canada is different politically than the US. For instance, it does not have the same type of two party system that the US does, so the choice for disenchanted Liberals is not to hold your nose and vote for them or stay home. Also, a number of Conservative candidates have apologized for things they have done or said in the past, meeting Mr. Scheer’s publicly announced threshold for forgiveness, as now has Mr. Trudeau whose apologies seem sincere and contrite. After we finish castigating Mr. Trudeau, we might notice that the only one still around who hasn’t apologized for his past offensive comments so far, seems to be Mr. Scheer himself.

It certainly reinforces the claim Trudeau is phoney and a don’t do what I do do what I tell you to do politician. Looks like the Liberal war room strategy of digging up dirt on opponents really turned around and bit them on this one. You have to wonder how long Canadian MSM sat on this story though? Certainly every aspect of Trudeau’s life must have been looked at and this was just in a yearbook not some secret document to be leaked.
We apparently live in a world where one tweet, email, or social media post can end your career. Perhaps some will take this incident as an opportunity to reflect on this and think twice when the next me too allegation comes out. In terms of what happens to Trudeau likely nothing, those who oppose PC and cancel culture should take the high road and some have. The shoot first and ask questions later crowd will continue to support virtue signalling politicians and take Trudeau’s I’m sorry I got caught apology as genuine.

I am uncomfortable whenever a past event is judged with current values. Imagine a successful politician emerges who ends all of his messages with ‘Enjoy your day’. If he becomes universally reviled, is it fair to chastise Farmer Brian because he used to use the same phrase, but quit when he didn’t want to be associated with the politician? Posting a photo of yourself with Faith Goldy before she came out as a white supremacist shouldn’t be a big deal, unless you leave the photo up. When I taught school I used to really enjoy teasing my students and they certainly enjoyed it as well. What if new research shows such teasing is detrimental, and hence a form of child abuse?

Looking at an event through 2019 lens should only be relevant if the person involved does nothing to denounce the earlier version of him/herself. Otherwise, what really matters is how the event was seen at the time.

At issue with regards to Mr. Trudeau’s brown face photo, then, is how appropriate or inappropriate it was in 2001, when the photo was taken. The photo was taken at an Arabian Nights party sanctioned by the private school Trudeau taught at. Thus, the entire event was culturally appropriated. Was cultural appropriation even a thing in 2001? When I taught in rural Alberta in the 80’s and 90’s. I didn’t hesitate to call out a student for using a racial slur, but I certainly don’t recall anyone complaining when someone dressed up as a native warrior for Halloween. Brown face paint was certainly available then (I suspect the warrior costume came with it). Can it still be found today?

Apparently Bob you are going to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the brown face photos. So how are you rationalizing the SNC-Lavelin affair, that happened this year not in the past?! And Bob enjoy your day!

Did the 4 RCMP investigations on Kenny’s leadership campaign hurt his election? Did the fact that Doug Ford was a grade 10 drop out who sold drugs sink him?

I have a longer list, but why go on? I think I’ve made my point.

Interestingly, National Post columnist Andrew Coyne — normally a reliably conservative columnist — had a take on this situation similar to my own: it wasn’t really about the racism of the acts themselves, but about the hypocrisy of Mr Trudeau’s sanctimonious hectoring on equality & diversity while he had this dark skeleton in his closet. If he was going to make this a central theme of his campaign, his own hands should have been squeaky clean on this issue, and they certainly aren’t.
I was also struck by this comment in Mr Coyne’s column: “Certainly the Conservatives, with their record of having exploited fears of Muslims, or asylum-seekers, or God help us, the Global Migration Compact, are in no position to point fingers.”. Just when you think he’s just another Postmedia Conservative apologist, he goes ahead and says something like this — makes it hard to ignore him, really.
I also think you can’t help but be impressed by the humanness and dignity with which Jagmeet Singh has responded to this whole affair. There are a lot of ways he could have responded to this, an issue that undoubtedly hits him very close to home as the first “person of colour” to lead a major national political party in this country; he chose to respond from his heart.

Gunfire metaphors may be in bad odour nowadays, but they are an entirely appropriate way to discuss the Liberal Party of Canada’s immediate response to the release of those excruciating photos of Justin Trudeau’s brownface escapades two decades ago, roiling the governing party’s re-election campaign.

Seeing the prime minister’s past politically incorrect behaviour exposed by media and effectively exploited by Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives — ironic considering how Conservatives are normally obsessed with assailing advocates of political correctness as limp-wristed ninnies — it didn’t take the Liberals even a day to pivot and attack one of the weakest points in the Conservative lines.

To wit: The gun nuts in their midst.

Yes, Liberals had been promising policy during the campaign to deal with the scourge of gun violence plaguing Canadian cities and widespread Canadian fears the U.S. epidemic of mass shootings may cross the 49th Parallel, but it was likely to be timid and nuanced.

But facing an existential crisis of their feckless leader’s own creation, the Liberals clearly moved the timing up, and probably stiffened the sinews, summoned up the blood to toughen the policy sufficiently to make it actually effective.

Or, to paraphrase Shakespeare a second time, it’s nice to have a horse on hand when you need one — or, in this case, a whole corral of horses’ asses.

Canadian Conservatives, as is widely understood, are snuggled deeply into bed with the foreign-funded gun lobby and wild-eyed Canadian NRA wannabes who, notwithstanding the absence of a Second Amendment in our peaceable Dominion’s Constitution, assert a constitutional right to introduce the conditions necessary for regular gun massacres to happen here too.


Gun nuts as they see themselves: (Photo: United States Army).

The Conservatives’ constant invocation of the “law abiding gun owner” is not very persuasive, but wasn’t high on the radar for a lot of Canadians who were nevertheless favourably enough disposed toward sensible gun-control laws to distrust such rhetoric.

But the thing about the gun fanatics and their overwrought defence of assault rifles, almost-assault rifles and pistols for the peeps is this: they just can’t shut up. (If you doubt this characterization, just watch the comments section below for the next few days! *)

Faced with a pivotal moment when the best thing they could do to help the party of their probable choice would be to shut the hell up, they’re rushing into the breach screaming about their supposed right to practice their anti-social hobby and their need to have guns on hand to overthrow imagined future governments.

As an aside, what kind of democratic government in waiting, which Mr. Scheer’s Conservatives are purported to be, would tolerate this kind of talk in their ranks?

So, while desperate times may call for desperate measures, the Liberals’ desperation tactic puts the Conservatives in an interesting box.

If their pistol-packin’ partisans won’t shut up, and they certainly won’t, Mr. Scheer has little choice but to keep repeating unconvincing bromides about the law-abidingness of gun owners. If he doesn’t sound persuasive enough, he just might lose the nutters and their valuable votes to Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada.


Gun nuts as others see them (Photo: Found on the Internet, no attribution).

This helps the Liberals establish the narrative that the Conservatives are not merely the party of unsavoury “old-stock” Canadians, but of dangerous bump-stock Canadians too!

What’s more, the louder the gun nuts holler, the more the real crazies within their ranks will crawl out from under their rocks. I kid you not, they’re already screeching on Twitter about how the black-helicopter boys from the United Nations are behind the plot to snatch their beloved AR-15s.

And the more the crazies dominate the discussion, the more Liberal proposals will start to make sense to a lot of voters in urban Canada.

Will this work? Too soon to say.

We’re certainly about to see a bunch of polls, many of them tendentious and methodologically unsound, indicating Mr. Trudeau’s embarrassment is driving supporters away from his Liberals. Whether this is a bump, a meaningful trend or wishful thinking remains to be seen.

But as my former colleague’s strategy illustrated, nothing blunts an attack like an energetic counterattack.

Canada’s gun nuts, standing ready to flood the Internet and the airwaves with full-on hysteria tinged with diagnosable paranoia, make an excellent target.

The gun “rights” mob certainly isn’t going to help Andrew Scheer by yelling, “Break out the Winchesters!” But just try to shut them up!

I had always thought the Liberals were holding back something on the issue of guns, to be used strategically if or more likely when needed. Clearly it is a bit of a rainy day time for the Liberals now so this doesn’t seem surprising they are using it at this time.

To use boxing metaphors, the Liberals have been hit hard and are reeling a bit. However, unless there is something else to come out of the tickle trunk, this was probably the Conservatives best shot. Now it is time for the Liberals to start to hit back. The gun issue was an easy one already in their back pocket, ready to use. I suspect the Liberals are already also combing through old year books and all that.

Mr. Scheer seems like the bland sort, so there may not be much to dig up on him, but you never know. These days allegations or rumors that sound even slightly credible are often as powerful or more powerful than actual evidence. Also, while their leader comes across as bland, I suspect the Conservative Party has its fair share or more of colourful and high profile individuals who have some interesting and perhaps yet unrevealed skeletons in their closets. The vetting process for both parties seems to be less than perfect. Of course one dilemma for the Liberals is timing. It’s probably better to save anything more damaging for later in the campaign, if possible, when it may have the most impact and it will be more diificult or not possible to replace candidates.

Not that I think Mr. Trudeau is comparable to the US President, but this sort of reminds me of the Access Hollywood tapes that came out in the last US Presidential election. They were very damaging and at the time it looked like they torpedoed the President’s chances. He even actually had to do something he tried to avoid and hated – apologize and show a bit of contrition. We know how that ended, there were a few more surprising twists and turns in that campaign before the end. I wouldn’t be surprised if something similar happens here.

Restrict guns and ban assault weapons?
Good promise but Jr is not well known for keeping promises.

What I think about this kabuki theatre election so far….

1) ‘Sheer’ hypocrisy from the CONs whose leader very recently & explicitly re-endorsed his own candidates that have repented their racist behavior.
CON voters know this and are likely bored by the hand wringing. Other voters recognize the deceit outright.

2) Jagmeet is doing better but the media is not doing him any favours with the endless ‘how does a person of colour really feel?’ He should pivot more quickly to the very good policies he is proposing (unlike Mulcair/2015)

3) Despite hiring the Prince of Darkness to improve communications, May can’t help but put her foot in her mouth. The abortion & separatist flaps cost her votes and momentum and her buy-CDN-oil-ploy (requiring massive ‘sunk costs’ investment in pipelines and esp refineries) has confused both her base and the great unwashed. Green peaked a while back.

4) Is Jr inadvertently racist? Perhaps but most of us recognize that we have baggage from growing up in a racist world. It’s the lack of judgement that bothers me. A 29 yr old teacher in 2001 should have known better and a 35 yr old putative Liberal candidate in 2008 who was ‘too embarrassed’ to reveal these incidents should have decided not to run. Nobody wants an airhead for PM.

5) Max ‘lost’ the CON leadership by so close a margin in such a convoluted voting system that the party had to destroy the ballots hours after they were counted. As Stalin might have said, “It doesn’t matter who votes, only who counts the votes”. I am pleased to see Max make the debates and I hope he takes enough votes across the country to stymie our milquetoast Andy.

If we get very lucky we’ll get a weak Lib minority that needs Green & Orange (but not Bloc) support.
And if the Green/Orange then focus on outcomes (like 1963-68 and 1972-74 & current BC situation) rather than plot to take power and trigger an early election ……….

Agreed: Scheer’s performance is pretty bad, stilted, insincere, contrived and ineffective. Given the generally shambling performances of May, JT, Max (and I ain’t even know about the Bloc), Jagmeet can hardly help but look comparatively better. He should hold steady and avoid getting dragged into the mud with the Big Two—so far, so good. I think he’s gonna surprise everybody. I think May might have already jumped the shark; because this is her ‘do-or-die’ opportunity—that is, her last—she has to pull out all the stops. And she’s tripping up a lot when the Greens should be riding a wave.

The longer it appears a dead heat between the Big Two, tactical voting will be considered by many voters, the strategy naturally being to keep the ScheerCons out. Everybody’s talking about a minority government. I’ve even heard May and Singh ruminate impolitically —leaders should never speculate on the composition of the HoC before an election: it presumes to know how voters will vote before they vote—potentially fomenting resentment and electorate reaction—and it also risks demoralizing party volunteers. But tactical-voting truly illustrates the fundamental difference between voters and politicians: it’s perfectly legitimate for voters to consider tactical-voting and to discuss it openly amongst each other. The clue that it’s worth considering is that most politicians, especially leaders (at least good ones) condemn it roundly for patently biased reasons.

I think the fact that JT was a drama teacher somewhat absolves his ill-fated decision to where makeup on stage—especially in roles that had traditionally required it and were still cast that way at the time. The whole thing was less a waste of time than I initially feared: some telling reaction was observed.

Scheer’s was very bad, almost carved of rote-wood, too quick out of the blocks and too outraged by half as to look like the second punch of a one-two set-up, and too reminding of the irony that the CPC and evil spawn PPC actually own the racism accusation themselves—truly an hypocrisy on Andrew’s part, and probably a net negative for his party, no matter who went to the trouble of putting the smear together.

May looked incredibly shaky and fumbling in response after getting entangled in a turban-flap by supposed Dipper turncoats to the Greens in New Brunswick.

Maxime Bernier was only too happy to pop in for a shit-eating smile opportunity, ready to kiss babies of low ethnic diversity. It’s remarkable that Singh comes out the best of them all, perhaps even more so that JT is probably the close runner-up—but May flubbed while Scheer and Bernier highlighted their most vulnerable flanks.

I don’t know about the Bloc, how it reacted to the blackface fiasco, but it seems every party walks on eggs around this issue in Quebec, anyway—even while openly forecasting a complete sweep-out of the NDP there because of Singh’s ethnicity and turban in a province which just opted out of the Charter in order to enact a ban on religion-identifying garb for provincial public employees. I’m not sure it’s ever that simple in Quebec. Recall just a couple years ago ad hoc ‘antifa’ protesters forced far-right La Meute marchers to take cover in underground parking, even attacking police assigned to the anti-immigrants’ defence.

Mainstream news media seems content to present the dead-heat model for as long as possible along with party popularity polls composed of national averages, neither of which much assists voters contemplating tactical voting—at least not specifically which candidate the best tactical choice in their respective ridings. But, presuming a hung result where either of the Big Two are the likely minority government, either will have a field of several parties and Independents to consider for parliamentary support. The trouble here is that some voters will be tempted to give one of these potential balance-of-power holders their vote instead of voting for the better tactical choice in an overall strategy to keep the ScheerCons out.

Keeps it all very interesting. Voters still need to consider very carefully what they’ll do with their votes, and that requires a concerted effort to estimate the relative popularities of candidates in any given riding. Is tactical voting worthwhile in that riding? If so, should one do it? And which candidate is the best tactical choice?

Short form: Greens plateau and/or fade; Cons stay near the lower margin-of-error tie behind the Liberals’ upper; NDP continues steady, if modest rise; PPC gets its 2¢-worth of the votes everywhere except Max’s own riding; Only place less predictable than Jody’s riding is Quebec. Subject to change.

Gun nuts is very appropriate indeed!

Scheer could easily discourage this for Alberta. If he loses 500 votes in each Alberta constituency the conservative candidate will only win by a thousand votes or six thousand votes in rural seats. Not much to worry about as far as Alberta seats go.

But he won’t unless Harper says to.

So to distract from Trudeau’s blunder exposing that he is as full of it as has been suspected he will pretend that gun control will stop the violence? Gun nuts will play their role perfectly, allowing any sane questions about the role pharmaceuticals may play in mass shootings or the lack of a future for young people due to the gutting of the Canadian economy by Liberal and conservative governments to be written off.
Perfect storm indeed the MSM can’t touch big pharma because they pay the bills, also their foreign owners love international trade deals so nothing there. Narrow thinking Urban voters get a chance to not only look down on rural voters but cling to the false sense of security that somehow restricting legal gun and ammunition sales will protect them from the local gang member who likely isn’t getting his gun through legal channels anyway.
Everyone plays their part but the problem doesn’t get solved.

So, the civilian market version of the AR-15 & its off-brand clones are nothing more than semi-automatic rifles in .223 calibre, aka 5.56 mm NATO. There are many semi-automatic hunting rifles sold in Canada, and while the AR-15 looks very much like a military assault rifle, in terms of firing rate it is no different than those other, more conventional looking semi-autos. There are legitimate concerns about magazine size, and about how easily they can be converted by an amateur in his basement workshop into full-auto … and I don’t know enough about that to comment on it. But, really, I’m not sure a ban on these weapons would have enough impact on public safety to justify the political Sturm und Drang that would ensue.

On the other hand — lol — there is the matter of a handgun ban. In my view, no Canadian civilian needs a handgun, period. They have no legitimate sporting purpose, unlike hunting arms, and aside from punching little holes in paper targets they already have no lawful use in this country. Ban them completely except for military and law-enforcement use, and introduce stiff penalties for their possession. Also tighten border screening to keep them from drifting over the border from the Benighted States. As for those already in circulation, an Aussie-style buyback programme, combined with an aggressive law enforcement effort to get them out of the hands of street gangs and other miscreants, would dramatically limit their prevalence in Canadian society, and over time they should become increasingly rare.

Handguns have a 100% sporting purpose. Jerry .M, the fastest handgun shooter in the world would disagree heavily with your hand gun perspective. There are many sponsors that invest in competition handgun ranges, shooter, and firearms. All done with Restricted Class Possesion Acquisition Licenses. Restricted is level 2 class and requires higher strength background checks DAILY by a RCMP law enforcement computer data base.

No one NEEDS a hand gun, except military/law enforcement, and other approved agencies.

But a civilian CAN responsibly own a hand gun by abiding by the very safe storage and safe transport laws already in place. Have fun at the range and practice, then if you feel skilled take your skills to competition level. How can you be come a professional sponsored shooter, if you can never even be offered access to the SPORT.

Mr. Climenhaga, to hear such rhetoric and disdain towards the citizens of our country who own guns is shameful of you. You talk of “nutters” who are looking for the next civil war, or an Armageddon to arrive, but you sir, are a nutter, just on the other end of the scale.

As Canadians, we are known for respecting other people, and their differences. You clearly do not like guns, and have no respect for people who do. That is your right. To degrade and insult other Canadian citizens because of their choice of hobby, is despicable, especially since your a member of the media.

For the record I am not a gun owner, but I have educated myself on the process, and the different firearms that are being debated. The citizens of this great country you deride, are the safest, and most law abiding sector of the population. I don’t think you realize what is required to obtain a licence to own a firearm, because if you did, you would apologize for your comments here.

They must have a squeaky clean record, have no mental issues, and must physically prove they can safely handle a firearm. If they fail any of these they will not be allowed to obtain a firearm.

These citizens are also checked daily against a national criminal database, and if their name appears on it, police seize their firearms literally within hours, and sometimes before they are even released if arrested.

I urge you to educate yourself regarding this issue, rather than spout your uneducated, and biased opinions that do nothing to solve the problems we are having in this country.

Though I suspect you will be no better than most people on this issue, who are too lazy to research this topic, and find the facts out for themselves.

We need real solutions to these real problems !!!

How about no bail or release for crimes involving a firearm, or a life sentence for a gang affiliated criminal who commits a crime with a firearm? How about deporting an individual, if they come from another country, and commit a crime with a firearm, regardless whether they have earned citizenship?

These are real solutions rather than curtail the privileges of a safe sector of Canadian society, or stealing their property that they have paid hard earned money for. That is what confiscation amounts to is illegal theft.

Real solutions for real problems, not rhetoric, disdain, and misinformation.

77,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Court’s decision to turn off Alberta’s turn-off-the-taps law should surprise no one,2019-09-25 02:22:00,David Climenhaga,,"Alberta’s so-called turn-off-the-taps law was pretty obviously unconstitutional when Rachel Notley’s New Democratic Party passed it and it continued to be unconstitutional when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party had it proclaimed into law.

So yesterday’s ruling of the Federal Court of Canada granting British Columbia a temporary injunction blocking application of the risibly named Preserving Canada’s Economic Prosperity Act while the courts make its unconstitutionality official should surprise no one.

The decision will come as a bitter disappointment to the UCP’s credulous base, but even Mr. Kenney and Energy Minister Sonya Savage dropped their usual bluster and didn’t sound all that shocked or appalled by what their lawyers must have told them Justice Sebastien Grammond was likely to say. Leastways, they obviously had their talking points in place.

David Eby, B.C.’s attorney general, called the injunction a “big win” because it means the province no longer has Alberta’s unconstitutional “significant threat to our economy and our people” in play, which is a fair assessment under the circumstances.

Arguably, the law allowing Alberta to blockade shipments of fuel from refineries here to force B.C.’s government to ignore the concerns of its own voters and knuckle under to Alberta’s demands for a pipeline was a moral and political failure by the NDP.


Former PC premier Alison Redford (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Democracy depends on a consensus not to abuse power, and drafting legislation known in advance to violate the nation’s constitution, putting that consensus at risk, amounts to moral failure. Hoping the belligerent attitude demanded by Mr. Kenney’s Conservatives would persuade die-hard right-wingers to grant the NDP another term in office in gratitude for legislation that horrified many of its most loyal supporters was foolhardy.

That said, at least the NDP had a plan for this legislation, albeit a cynical one. They’d fail to proclaim it into law, and argue it couldn’t be challenged in court before it became the law of the land.

Notwithstanding Mr. Kenney’s promise to his supporters to undo everything the NDP did in office, he obviously liked the nasty tone of the PCEPA, ignored the outgoing NDP’s warnings, and had it proclaimed into law soon after coming to power in last April’s provincial election.


Former PC premier Jim Prentice (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Ms. Notley now mocks Mr. Kenney for this blunder, comparing his decision to proclaim the law to blowing up a missile on the launch pad. “This is classic Jason Kenney. It’s all about politics, it’s not about getting the job done,” the Edmonton Journal quoted her saying.

For his part, Mr. Kenney responded lamely that,“I assume that former premier Notley got advice that this was compliant with the Constitution.” The rest of us assume that the government’s lawyers told him otherwise, but whatever.

The last time something like this happened, Alison Redford was the Progressive Conservative premier of Alberta and the law her government had passed was an effort to suppress the fundamental free-speech rights of anyone who dared argue an illegal strike was an appropriate response to her government’s plan to terminate the legal arbitration rights of public employees.

That was in 2013, and the Public Sector Services Continuation Act, was patently unconstitutional. Ms. Redford, who like Ms. Notley is a capable lawyer, adopted the same strategy — to pass the law but not proclaim it.


Canadian Senator and former journalist Paula Simons (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

What happened then is rich in irony, given what has happened since. The Wildrose Party — now the base of Mr. Kenney’s UCP — took the side of the public sector unions most impacted by the law.

“The Wildrose Party believes strongly in the rule of law and upholding contracts, including collective bargaining agreements,” it said in a pious statement. The party insisted this was a position of principle, not at all cynical.

Paula Simons, then a political columnist for the Edmonton Journal and now a member of the Senate of Canada, observed dryly in her column that Alberta Union of Provincial Employees President Guy Smith and Wildrose leader Danielle Smith “make unlikely bedfellows. But in the cold of Alberta politics, sometimes you need to snuggle up with unexpected allies under the covers.” I imagine neither Ms. Smith nor Mr. Smith appreciated Ms. Simons’ metaphor.


Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Alas, last June, when Mr. Kenney’s UCP Government passed and proclaimed the Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act, which suspends the legal arbitration rights of public employees, there was not a peep of protest or concern about the rule of law from any of those previously principled Wildrosers.

Soon after Jim Prentice became PC premier in 2014, his government passed legislation repealing the Redford era law, a political gambit every bit as effective as Ms. Notley’s adoption of the turn-off-the-taps strategy.

Nevertheless, while he lost the 2015 election to the NDP, the late Mr. Prentice at least deserves credit for doing the right thing to eliminate Ms. Redford’s unconstitutional bill.

Mr. Kenney, again ironically, appears determined to stand by what is arguably Ms. Notley’s worst piece of legislation while tearing up the many good laws her government passed.

How to deal with influential bloggers, a lesson from history

The Paula Simons column quoted above was published by the Edmonton Journal on Dec. 3, 2013. It ran on page 5 of the paper and, unfortunately, is no longer available except through online databases.

In it, Ms. Simons summarized the argument of a law professor on the government’s strategy behind the Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act. “In his analysis,” she wrote, “the new legislation, with its pointed emphasis on stiff fines for advocating an illegal strike, is designed to intimidate high-profile, labour-affiliated bloggers, such as Dave Climenhaga and Dave Cournoyer.” (Emphasis added.)

If only this were true!

Readers will understand, despite my scepticism about this interpretation of the Redford Government’s motives, why Ms. Simons is my favourite Canadian Senator, and is likely ever to remain so","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Its seems like a fitting description of Mr. Kenney may be “good at politics, not so good at the law”. If I recall correctly, after the election, but when she was still Premier, Ms. Notley warned or advised Mr. Kenney to not proclaim this law. At that point she had little if anything to gain politically and it probably would have been easy enough for him to just do nothing, as advised. Did he listen? No!

This law was Mr. Kenney’s idea originally, sort of foisted on the previous NDP government as a way to make it look like they were doing something, when the action proposed was not likely realistically possible. It was one of Mr. Kenney’s clever political traps – do nothing and lose political support, try and fail and lose political support. Except, Premier Notley did not fall into the trap entirely and left it to potentially spring back on Kenney, which it now has.

At some point Mr. Kenney’s supporters are going to begin to wonder if he is as brilliant as he tries to come across as, why isn’t he accomplishing much and why are his ideas turning out so bad.

Your last sentence is 100 % on target. I’ve said the same thing more or less for a couple of months. I give his supporters till around spring before they start grumbling about nothing changing. There is nothing he can do to a significant degree to change the fossil fuel ship around. Witness his recent trip to the maritimes where he made useless gestures . Alberta is a stepping stone for Kenney on his hopeful way back to Ottawa.

I agree but who will he and his supporters blame when this happens? They got in by blaming the NDP for all the problems but that won’t work a second time. Kenney reminds me of a person I once knew who didn’t stay at jobs too long for fear that people would find out they had no idea what they were doing. Great in the interview, reasonable experience on paper and enough references to get the job but doing the actual work was another story. How long can Kenney stay in Alberta before people realize he has no idea what he is doing?

It’s cute that you think his supporters will pay any attention at all to evidence. Anything that benefits them is because of their super-awesome conservative governments, and anything that negatively impacts them is because of the NDP, or the federal Liberals, or leftists in general, or Russian and/or Chinese spies.

Mr. Kenney’s true believers will soon come face to face with the reality that the good times for oil in Alberta and the good paying jobs it once offered are gone for good. Climate change is behind that and it doesn’t matter what Kenney or the UCP think or want to believe. Mother nature is going to wake up her sons and daughters even in Alberta to the reality that faces that one horse economy. Maybe not real soon but not too long from now. This is especially so if the sons and daughters want to live a long life as most humans are pre-programmed to do.

It gives a whole new meaning to pro life.

Speaking of unproclaimed legislation coming back to bite you in the rear end … I still think it’s too bad the NDP didn’t repeal the then-dormant Education Act early on in their mandate while they had the chance. Had they done so, the UCP would have had to do a bit more work to reverse the Bill 24 GSA protections in the School Act after they took office, and while that might not have stopped them from doing it, it might have been a higher profile effort & created more protest than turned out to be the case.

Kenney has a love of bad laws and, like Harper, a deep faith in those defending such laws before the courts. The defence of those laws will fail the legal test, but they will forever be placed on appeal, in the faint hope the judge(s) can either be bought, or snooze long enough to allow a few of them to slip through. In the mind of Kenney and his fellow travellers, the courts are the enemy, full stop.

Yes, the fired-up but well-behaved crowd of truants and their supporters in Alberta’s capital, estimated by its organizers from Climate Justice Edmonton at 4,000 people and probably considerably bigger, was dwarfed by the multitudes of climate-change protesters elsewhere in Canada — 20,000 in Victoria, more than 100,000 in Vancouver, and well over 300,000 in Montreal.

And, yes, none of this is particularly good news for Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and his ridiculous “war room” strategy and belligerent defence of doing things the way we’ve always done them in Alberta, which is to say, without much consideration for the planet.

But it seems probable that in the long term the concerns of these soon-to-be voters have the potential to be the worst news for Mr. Kenney and his party, if not an impediment to his immediate plans.


MLA Lori Sigurdson, then a member of Rachel Notley’s cabinet, listens respectfully to opponents of the NDP’s farm-safety legislation on Nov. 30, 2016 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Certainly one would have thought the UCP would take note, regardless of the party’s undeniable success in last April’s provincial election, and treat the concerns of such a large group with a little respect.

Nevertheless, UCP ministers and MLAs seem to have all taken a powder yesterday, trailing impolite tweets from their online rage machine.

The boys in short pants, the party’s sophomoric political staffers and paid social media trolls, plastered I-[HEART]-[MAPLE LEAF]-Oil+Gas placards in the windows of their bottom-floor offices in the stately and historic Legislature Building. Remember, these are supposed to be the grownups with jobs.

Contrast this with the previous government’s reaction to the glowering crowd of 1,000 or so angry and sometimes threatening farmers protesting the NDP’s farm-safety legislation at the same address in November 2015. NDP ministers went outside and worked the crowd, respectfully listening and arguing their case.

UCP MLAs and political staffers may have truck-nuts on their pickups, but when it comes to going out in the cold and talking to folks who disagree with them, there’s not much sign of the real thing.

Seeing George Clark in (climate) action

It was interesting if not particularly instructive to hear George Clark, best known in Alberta as the #Kudatah Guy who back in 2016 promised to magically remove the NDP government without an election, in a “debate” with energy journalist Markham Hislop attended by about 40 people in Edmonton Thursday.


George Clark, best remembered in Alberta for his #Kudatah claims in 2016 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Hislop took what might be called the Notley position: More pipelines are needed now, but we also need counterbalancing action to reduce carbon emissions and a plan for the day folks won’t want to buy our fossil fuels. He relied on arguments and statistics mostly gleaned from interviews with academics and fossil fuel industry executives.

Mr. Clark took a modified Kenney position that I would characterize as, drill, baby, drill; the world will always want our oil. He seemed to rely mainly on anecdotes about what real Albertans think and outlandish claims like the notion large oil and gas companies favouring carbon taxes are run by “environmental socialists.”


Energy journalist Markham Hislop (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I’m simplifying, but you can watch it yourself if you have the fortitude. However, you’ll have to look it up since I’ve long been banned from Mr. Clark’s Facebook page. Mr. Clark remains welcome to comment on this blog, as he does from time to time.

There was nobody there to make the argument made by 4,000 or more protesters at the Legislature yesterday, that we’d better have climate action right now or we soon won’t have a planet to live on.

That said, it’s my considered opinion Mr. Hislop mopped the floor with Mr. Clark, as far as it went.

Additional entertainment was provided from the floor of an east Edmonton private school gymnasium by the well informed and always argumentative Joe Anglin, former Green Party Leader and Wildrose Party MLA turned dissident.

A note on crowd sizes

Crowd sizes are always hard to estimate. Mainstream media are notorious for seriously underestimating them.


Global News airborne shot of the gathering crowd at the Legislature yesterday (Photo: Screenshot of Global News video).

The CBC put the size of yesterday’s Climate Action Strike protest at about 2,000 people, ludicrously low. The event’s organizers said about 4,000 people attended, which is clearly more accurate just by eyeballing photos of the crowd. This estimate seems to have been accepted by most reporters.

However, given the number of people coming and going and the huge area in which the crowd was gathered, I would estimate it as much higher, with participation probably closer to 8,000 people throughout the four-hour event.

I’ve been going to these things and taking photos for more than 20 years. I was certainly not alone yesterday in thinking this was the largest crowd in front of the Legislature I’ve ever seen.

Moreover, it was also the only really large crowd that didn’t have participants bused in by deep-pocketed organizers from other parts of Alberta. No, this was made up mostly of high school and university students who walked or took public transit to the protest.

So this represents real commitment by a large community of like-minded people, and hard work by talented young organizers. If I were a UCP strategist, I’d give that a more respectful and serious response than a few snotty, misspelled tweets and sticking signs in some windows","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">It was interesting if not particularly instructive to hear George Clark, best known in Alberta as the #Kudatah Guy who back in 2016 promised to magically remove the NDP government without an election, in a “debate” with energy journalist Markham Hislop attended by about 40 people in Edmonton Thursday.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Mr. Hislop took what might be called the Notley position: More pipelines are needed now, but we also need counterbalancing action to reduce carbon emissions and a plan for the day folks won’t want to buy our fossil fuels. He relied on arguments and statistics mostly gleaned from interviews with academics and fossil fuel industry executives.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Clark took a modified Kenney position that I would characterize as, <i>drill, baby, drill; the world will always want our oil.</i> He seemed to rely mainly on anecdotes about what real Albertans think and outlandish claims like the notion large oil and gas companies favouring carbon taxes are run by “environmental socialists.”</p>

<p class=""p1"">There was nobody there to make the argument made by 4,000 or more protesters at the Legislature yesterday, that we’d better have climate action right now or we soon won’t have a planet to live on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That said, it’s my considered opinion Mr. Hislop mopped the floor with Mr. Clark, as far as it went.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The CBC put the size of yesterday’s Climate Action Strike protest at about 2,000 people, ludicrously low. The event’s organizers said about 4,000 people attended, which is clearly more accurate just by eyeballing photos of the crowd. This estimate seems to have been accepted by most reporters.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, given the number of people coming and going and the huge area in which the crowd was gathered, I would estimate it as much higher, with participation probably closer to 8,000 people throughout the four-hour event.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I’ve been going to these things and taking photos for more than 20 years. I was certainly not alone yesterday in thinking this was the largest crowd in front of the Legislature I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Moreover, it was also the only really large crowd that didn’t have participants bused in by deep-pocketed organizers from other parts of Alberta. No, this was made up mostly of high school and university students who walked or took public transit to the protest.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So this represents real commitment by a large community of like-minded people, and hard work by talented young organizers. If I were a UCP strategist, I’d give that a more respectful and serious response than a few snotty, misspelled tweets and sticking signs in some windows.</p>

Any of the severely normal Albertans who didn’t vote for the UCP in April came to realize ages ago that the party of morally bankrupt conservative climate change deniers was never going to act on climate change in any meaningful way to curtail anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

Therefore, it should not come as a shock or surprise to those enlightened voters that the longer the party of environmental miscreants are kept in office and left to peddle their market-fundamentalist ideological dogma, the longer the planet will worsen and continue to experience monumental environmental degradation. Let’s hope our new climate change warriors who rallied yesterday and others like young Swedish environmental trailblazer Greta Thunberg (who spoke in Montreal yesterday) stay true to the cause — and vote accordingly.

Excellent article on Greta Thunberg in the Guardian (see link below):https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant

This messaging by environmentalists that we have twelve years to prevent human extinction is certainly overwrought. As a farmer who has experienced early snowfall 2 out of the last 3 years and it looks like it will snow early again this weekend my experience has been that weather is trending colder not warmer. Most of my neighbors have set up natural gas powered grain dryers in the last few years to dry their grain because of the cold wet falls. The disconnect between urban and rural voters certainly continues to widen.

As for the debate of the necessity of a carbon tax I found this article on the Sierra Club website about B.C.’s GHG emissions and how they have continued to increase while having the highest carbon tax in Canada. sierraclub.bc.ca/bcs-greenhouse-gas-emissions-have-risen-in-four-of-the-last-five-years/.

Also as a farmer I hear nothing from the political parties on how they envision the future of farming and food production in their theoretical world with net zero emissions and restricted fossil fuel consumption! Enjoy your day.

I totally agree that our climate is trending colder. I work out doors and experience the weather first hand. The city dwellers are trending towards decisions that do not account for their own needs. I don’t see many gardens or livestock in the cities so how will they survive. Who is doing the math because I cannot see the connection in regards to this carbon issue. Someone came up with Canada producing 1.6% of the world’carbon production yet we have the highest per capita tree count which takes care of 2.7% of the carbon produced worldwide. Now a figure of 38% of Canada’s carbon production is being thrown around that the oil sands alone produces yet they are spending more money and research on carbon reduction and carbon capture technology. Canada has refuneries accross the nation and no figures given for their contributions.
A reality check would be to have all the demonstrators not use any item produced from oil or natural gas by products and see how that goes.

Farmer Brian: This, in fact is why we now call it “climate change” and not “global warming” — a more unpredictable climate with greater extremes of weather phenomena, combined with an increasing GLOBAL AVERAGE temperature. We also expect to see changes in the distribution of drought areas as well as of flooding … northward migration of formerly tropical pest species and tropical disease insect vectors … and many other effects that directly, and negatively, impact agriculture.

As for me, I’m going over to see my grandchildren this morning, so I do expect to enjoy my day … I hope you enjoy yours too.

You’ve just said you’ve experienced climate change what with cold falls, early snow. Not everywhere is going to get warmer all at once. In the Maritimes, we’ve had later and later springs but with rain not snow, hot summers, tropical humidity and early frosts. The effects will vary from place to place just as day-to-day weather does.

Apparently you need there to be some definitive on-off switch thrown in your own backyard before you and your native intelligence can believe it. Not for you to believe specialists, you’re way smarter than those folk. Too bad you can’t believe your fellow citizens who’ve been flooded out, or watched permafrost melting their housing into Hudson’s Bay. No, in your few hundred acres of perceptual reality, whose effects are somehow multiplied to be the same worldwide, like 46C in Paris did not happen dude, there’s no problem whatsoever.

NOAA and NASA have documented the rise of world temperature each year. You, meanwhile, some utter nonentity out in the sticks, have decided you know better than that.

You’re wrong, but intellectually incapable of realizing it. Simple as that.

Farmer Brian: Since the early 1990s, it has been getting warmer in North America, not colder. There has been several record hot summers. There has been many years where very bad drought has happened. Alberta has North America’s first ever carbon tax, because Ed Stelmach put it there. Jason Kenney did not get rid of Alberta’s carbon tax. It’s still here.

Yes you are quite correct that Alberta still has a carbon tax on industrial emissions. I am curious why no one is willing to address the fact C02 emissions are going up in both B.C. and Alberta even though both provinces have had a carbon tax for over a decade?!

Bill I am fortunate enough that my family has farmed some of the same land for 113 years. We have certainly seen weather all over the map in that time period so I do enjoy the condescending responses attacking my intelligence in regards to climate change, funny how you all prefer to insult me rather than explain why existing carbon taxes are not lowering emissions! I do realize it is much easier to attack then it is to have a rational debate. Enjoy you day one and all!

The reason why BC emissions have crept up is due to their increasing population. When that is accounted for CO2 emissions have dropped by 2% overall. Their per capita emissions have gone down in other words. BTW…don’t mistake puzzlement for condescension. The basic facts about AGW have been around for a while and as a farmer it is puzzling you would not know that.

As a farmer’s daughter, I remember when I was a kid, 40 years ago, my mom telling me to not plant a garden before May long weekend as we were guaranteed a killing frost any time up until then, and even sometimes after. Also, said garden had to be finished by September long weekend as we would have a killing frost any time after that. I notice that hasn’t been happening. Killing frosts aren’t happening in my area (Lethbridge) until close to October, and we generally don’t have any in May any more, even April is pushing it. This is not science of course, just observation. I also remember winters being much colder and with more snow. My dad went out with the tractor to “unstuck” the school bus more than once.

We are, in general, having more mild and shorter winters, in my observation. I’m sure there’s data out there as well to support (or deny) my observations.

We have had thunderstorms in November. NOVEMBER! We have had rain in December! That NEVER happened when I was a kid. After September, if there was any precipitation, it was snow, not rain.

This is a sign of how the future looks and I don’t think it seems very bright for Mr. Kenney and his reactionary gang, some of whom were hunkered down in the basement of the Legislature. Yes, people who cling to the past can gain power sort of as a last gasp reaction by those who want to bring back a mythical nostalgic past or to hold back the march of history. Eventually the dam bursts, usually suddenly and sometimes unexpectedly, and things move forward. We had a moment like that in Alberta in 2015 and arguably also in 1971. Other provinces have had this sort of thing too, such as Quebec in the 1960’s.

I believe Mr. Kenney was in another part of Edmonton at a function, so he may have had an excuse to miss this big protest, but I am sure he is well aware of it. He is a smooth operator and I am sure will do his best to appear unruffled or unconcerned, but it is one of the largest in front of the Legislature for a long time. I am sure he must realize that for such a protest of this size to occur in Alberta also does not portend well for his planned disinformation campaign particularly elsewhere, where similar protests were considerably larger. At least Mr. Kenney did not flee the city to avoid the protests, as did his Federal leader Mr. Scheer. That in particular will not be a good look moment for Scheer, who up until now has mainly just been avoiding Pride Parades, but left Montreal just in advance of the largest protest and went to the other side of the country.

I think one of the natural hazards of being a reactionary conservative is you can’t avoid eventual progress and it is hard to fight it, as I am sure Mr. Kenney has already found out in his own long mostly losing battle against gay rights. The Federal Conservatives seem to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing from the Harper years. Their fight in this election against the carbon tax almost seems to be a repeat of Harper’s 2008 campaign. However, Mr. Trudeau for his flaws is a better politician and campaigner than Stephan Dion, the Liberal who initially advocated a carbon tax in 2008, and in the years since then concerns about climate change and the environment have increased considerably, not decreased.

If the Conservative anti carbon tax message does not sell well Federally in this upcoming Federal election, I wonder if after the election it will be a time for self reflection for them. If so, it could also be very bad news for Mr. Kenney’s barely disguised ambition to take over the Federal leadership. Of course his colleagues will still want someone with solid conservative views to lead them, but perhaps not someone with such reactionary views anymore. The times are changing.

Nice to see, of course, but the more useful and realistic strategy would be for progressive, environment-minded Albertans to do the math, read the history, and move to BC and SK. The four-year Notley blip only served to obscure and delay the obvious constructive pathway.

An influx of, say, 100,000 new residents, correctly distributed, would do wonders to revive the SK NDP and solidify the party’s hold on the BC Legislature. Of course, the party’s energy and environment policies certainly need work in both provinces – under Horgan, the Brown faction in the NDP has been in charge – but one step at a time.

I speak, of course, of prime minister Pierre Trudeau and the National Energy Program implemented by his Liberal government in 1980.


Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Marcos Oliveira, Creative Commons).

Generations of Alberta youngsters learned in the cradle the NEP was the Thing That Almost Ate Alberta.

Now that fossil fuels don’t appear to be quite the Crown jewel they used to seem, however, the thought that some sort of national strategy to get the most out of our petroleum resources might be a good idea after all seems at last to have occurred to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and his brain trust.

They have subtly rebranded the concept as the National Energy Corridor — unavoidable, really, given the way Canadian Conservatives, particularly here in Alberta, have relentlessly excoriated the NEP and the Trudeaus for the past four decades. Almost no one will notice.

They have shifted the emphasis too. Instead of proposing to use the market value in our fossil fuel resources to benefit all Canadians, they would like to use the tax value in all Canadians to keep cash flowing into the pockets of fossil fuel corporations as long as possible, and, as an inevitable consequence, greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at an unsustainable rate.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the days of Pierre Trudeau and the NEP, the notion greenhouse gasses might be a problem was understood in scientific circles, but wasn’t really on the radar of public consciousness. What was on Canadians’ minds were the high prices and fuel shortages of the oil crisis of the 1970s.

The goal of the Mr. Trudeau’s NEP was, in the words of Finance Minister Allan MacEachen’s October 1980 budget, to guarantee “security of supply and ultimate independence from the world oil market; opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry; particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion; and fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.”

When that was written, oil prices were at a peak, and most oil and gas corporations were content just to ship the stuff south. It was the thought of sharing too much of our fossil fuel bonanza with other Canadians that first got up Albertans’ noses.

When world prices began heading south in 1981, though, the grownups in premier Peter Lougheed’s Alberta government certainly understood the battering the regional economy was taking was not prime minister Trudeau’s fault.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Nevertheless, the sudden economic downturn was easy to blame on the NEP. This became a convenient stick with which to beat the federal Liberals. Conservatives used it to solidify their support in Western Canada with the confidence some day high prices would return. As indeed they did eventually — for a spell.

To the Conservatives’ credit, if you can call it that, this was done masterfully. Today, the notion the NEP caused an economic disaster is an article of faith in these parts.

Still, the times, they are a-changin’. Now the prime minister of Canada is named Trudeau again and there is much wider public understanding of environmental science. There is worldwide concern about rising global temperatures, and a technological shift toward electrification. In the United States, there is talk of a Green New Deal. And there is Greta Thunberg, the era of late capitalism’s answer to St. Joan of Arc, grabbing all the headlines.

The thought of wide-open continued expansion of Alberta’s oilsands resource is no longer universally supported everywhere in Canada. The belief there will be a market for Alberta’s bitumen until the end of time no longer seems so certain.


Greta Thunberg, the Joan of Arc of the late-capitalist era (Photo: Anders Hellberg, Creative Commons).

Continued development of Alberta’s oilsands and the infrastructure needed to sell more of their output abroad, those pipelines, has become a key issue in the Oct. 21 federal election — and not necessarily on Alberta’s terms.

What’s more, it’s starting to look as if the fossil fuel industry can’t survive in its present robust state without state intervention, and, lo and behold, the Conservatives, who have practically worshiped the Market as almighty god for the past 40 years, suddenly see the wisdom in putting a heavy interventionist hand on the economic tiller.

This used to be known as picking winners and losers and was said by Conservatives not to be government’s job. Now it’s said by the same people to be a reasonable response to a sinister international conspiracy to “landlock” our resource. Here in Alberta, there is a “war room,” an “inquiry,” and oil billionaires screeching “treason” at environmentalists on the Internet.

In the midst of this comes Mr. Scheer’s big idea of a federal economic corridor running from the Pacific to the Atlantic — that is, running in two directions from the Athabasca bitumen deposits to salt water — as the key policy of a rebranded NEP. Under NEP 2.0, Alberta will still share with the rest of the country, but mostly just the pain.

Since Mr. Scheer is fully invested in Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s antisocial-license approach to resource development, this is bound not to go over well in British Columbia and Quebec in particular if the Conservatives manage to beat Justin Trudeau and win the federal election.

Despite Mr. Kenney’s constant bleating that not allowing Alberta to have as many pipelines as it wants whenever it wants them will “Balkanize” the country, punching unpopular pipeline corridors from Fort McMurray to Prince Rupert and Saint John seems an unlikely recipe for national unity.

Still, the idea appears to have support in those Conservative-run provincial capitals where there’s still some life in the “energy superpower” dream of former prime minister Stephen Harper, from which both Mr. Scheer and Mr. Kenney draw inspiration.

So perhaps if the electoral winds blow his way, Mr. Scheer will have a chance to see how it all works out.

If he does, at least he could give the elder Mr. Trudeau some of the credit for the idea. And if by chance it fails to work as promised, maybe the resulting political chaos could be used by some future Conservative leader to attack the government of prime minister Xavier Trudeau …

<p class=""p1"">The goal of the Mr. Trudeau’s NEP was, in the words of Finance Minister Allan MacEachen’s October 1980 budget, to guarantee “security of supply and ultimate independence from the world oil market; opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry; particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion; and fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">When that was written, oil prices were at a peak, and most oil and gas corporations were content just to ship the stuff south. It was the thought of sharing too much of our fossil fuel bonanza with other Canadians that first got up Albertans’ noses.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When world prices began heading south in 1981, though, the grownups in premier Peter Lougheed’s Alberta government certainly understood the battering the regional economy was taking was not prime minister Trudeau’s fault.</p>

Climenhaga).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Nevertheless, the sudden economic downturn was easy to blame on the NEP. This became a convenient stick with which to beat the federal Liberals. Conservatives used it to solidify their support in Western Canada with the confidence some day high prices would return. As indeed they did eventually — for a spell.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To the Conservatives’ credit, if you can call it that, this was done masterfully. Today, the notion the NEP caused an economic disaster is an article of faith in these parts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, the times, they are a-changin’. Now the prime minister of Canada is named Trudeau again and there is much wider public understanding of environmental science. There is worldwide concern about rising global temperatures, and a technological shift toward electrification. In the United States, there is talk of a Green New Deal. And there is Greta Thunberg, the era of late capitalism’s answer to St. Joan of Arc, grabbing all the headlines.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The thought of wide-open continued expansion of Alberta’s oilsands resource is no longer universally supported everywhere in Canada. The belief there will be a market for Alberta’s bitumen until the end of time no longer seems so certain.</p>
<div class=""wp-caption alignright"" id=""attachment_31757"" style=""width: 236px;""><img width=""226"" height=""300"" class=""size-medium wp-image-31757"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-31757"" alt="""" src=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greta_Thunberg_02-226x300.jpg"" srcset=""https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greta_Thunberg_02-226x300.jpg 226w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greta_Thunberg_02-300x400.jpg 300w, https://albertapolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/Greta_Thunberg_02.jpg 500w"" sizes=""(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px""><p class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-31757"">Greta Thunberg, the Joan of Arc of the late-capitalist era (Photo: Anders Hellberg, Creative Commons).</p></div>
<p class=""p1"">Continued development of Alberta’s oilsands and the infrastructure needed to sell more of their output abroad, those pipelines, has become a key issue in the Oct. 21 federal election — and not necessarily on Alberta’s terms.</p>
<p class=""p1"">What’s more, it’s starting to look as if the fossil fuel industry can’t survive in its present robust state without state intervention, and, lo and behold, the Conservatives, who have practically worshiped the Market as almighty god for the past 40 years, suddenly see the wisdom in putting a heavy interventionist hand on the economic tiller.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This used to be known as picking winners and losers and was said by Conservatives not to be government’s job. Now it’s said by the same people to be a reasonable response to a sinister international conspiracy to “landlock” our resource. Here in Alberta, there is a “war room,” an “inquiry,” and oil billionaires screeching “treason” at environmentalists on the Internet.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the midst of this comes Mr. Scheer’s big idea of a federal economic corridor running from the Pacific to the Atlantic — that is, running in two directions from the Athabasca bitumen deposits to salt water — as the key policy of a rebranded NEP. Under NEP 2.0, Alberta will still share with the rest of the country, <em>but mostly just the pain.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">Since Mr. Scheer is fully invested in Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s antisocial-license approach to resource development, this is bound not to go over well in British Columbia and Quebec in particular if the Conservatives manage to beat Justin Trudeau and win the federal election.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite Mr. Kenney’s constant bleating that not allowing Alberta to have as many pipelines as it wants whenever it wants them will “Balkanize” the country, punching unpopular pipeline corridors from Fort McMurray to Prince Rupert and Saint John seems an unlikely recipe for national unity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, the idea appears to have support in those Conservative-run provincial capitals where there’s still some life in the “energy superpower” dream of former prime minister Stephen Harper, from which both Mr. Scheer and Mr. Kenney draw inspiration.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So perhaps if the electoral winds blow his way, Mr. Scheer will have a chance to see how it all works out.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If he does, at least he could give the elder Mr. Trudeau some of the credit for the idea. And if by chance it fails to work as promised, maybe the resulting political chaos could be used by some future Conservative leader to attack the government of prime minister Xavier Trudeau …</p>

I am a little confused David, if I understand Andrew Scheer’s proposal it is for a cross Canada corridor for the transportation and potential export of oil, natural gas and electricity as well as telecommunications. If I remember correctly the NEP invoved a made in Canada price for the oil sold in Canada and a federal tax or royalty on oil produced in Alberta. Alberta could not sell its oil for world price. With Andrew Scheer’s energy corridor Quebec for example could export excess hydroelectricity to western Canada. Alberta could transport more oil to the east coast for refining or export or maybe natural gas to a LNG export terminal on the ease coast. I do not agree that this is NEP 2.0. Enjoy your day.

I can’t imagine Scheer winning a single seat in Quebec if he really means a coast to coast energy corridor. Quebec makes too much from the Churchill Falls deal, good to 2041 when the current contract expires.

An energy corridor is just a conservative dog whistle for seizing private farm, ranch, and first nations land and giving it to the energy companies. Sheer’s big idea is just re-cycled Alberta Con theft and will do nothing but create animosity.

If any national Energy Corridor east gets built I have the suspicion it will be used to export bitumen not foster any energy self sufficiency whatever that means. As usual, the pipeline will be paid for by tax dollars and the profits shipped out of the country just like in the days of the beaver pelt. Except Canadians will be stuck with the environmental costs. What else is new in the Canadian mosaic?
Meanwhile the arrival of Greta Thunberg (aka Miss Chuckie) to our shores was perfect timing. While the real fossils fuel protestors are getting tear gassed she’s proving photo ops for the likes of Trudeau and Obama anxious to market their green credentials.

National energy corridor, including electrical lines sounds wonderful in a theoretical way, but as always the devil is in the details and it brings up a number of troubling questions. We already have numerous power lines and pipelines crossing the country that have been built over the years. They are in various places, some where it made sense at the time to put them, not just in one specific corridor. Would a national energy corridor mean that pipelines or power lines could in the future only be built in a specific corridor? I am not sure pipeline companies would like that. Remember the uproar from them when people suggested to change the routes of Keystone XL, Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain. They pipeline companies complained how expensive it would be to change the routes and it would then make the projects uneconomic. How wide would this corridor be? Would there only be one corridor?

If this corridor is just based on an existing or planned pipeline route, it does not make any of the issues related to them magically go away. It just makes it politically sound more palatable. I doubt the people impacted by the corridor will just role over and surrender. Also, the corridor’s political appeal in a place like Quebec, which may want to say build new electricity lines may be negated by the fact that on the other hand oil pipelines are really not much liked there. Would a national energy corridor be used to resurrect Energy East? Accordingly, I think most people in Quebec would see the energy corridor idea as a bit of Trojan horse and reject the idea.

I suppose the only way to try sell this idea is to keep it as vague as possible. Once you start asking questions, it seems to easily unravel. This idea, to use the Conservatives own attack words, is not as advertised. I suppose it might appeal to the base if they don’t think about it too much and perhaps that is how the Conservatives want to run their campaign – motivate their base as much as possible and try to get their opponents supporters to either stay home or be divided. It does not seem Scheer is looking for votes much beyond those that already support the Conservatives.

The irony and hypocrisy abounds with the Conservatives. If the Liberals proposed something like this, they’d get blasted for it. The CPC proposes it, and it’s okay? In any case, oil booms are long gone. Oil prices sank in 2014, thanks to Saudi Arabia and America controlling oil prices.

CPC leader Andrew Scheer’s promise of a second National Energy Program (NEP 2.0), upon first dimpled blush, uses the father’s first NEP 1.0 to simply dwarf his son’s TMX proposal, simply arguing how a Canadian taxpayer-gifted pipeline for Alberta to export diluted bitumen through can possibly be a bad thing, a simply ‘not-good-enough’ thing—indeed, so insulting to Alberta that its government has set up a “war room” to defend itself against a “sinister international conspiracy” to landlock its primary resource, bitumen—as if TMX doesn’t exist (or, if it does, simply insufficiently by dastardly design), as if Canada didn’t buy out Kinder Morgan’s Transmountain (TM) pipeline-twinning expansion project (TMX) to the tune of $4.5 billion, with another double-digit, billion-dollar funding commitment to construct it, a national investment that almost entirely benefits Alberta.

As usual—and tried and true—the simple narrative simply ignores any others, veracity notwithstanding, so that the focus remains transfixed on the empty shell: now you see pea, now you don’t, similarly to the generic, ‘Hail Mary’ gospel that redacts the realities of dilbit-export policy, rendering and slaking-off a number of exceptions to the Alberta UCP government’s national-crisis narrative like, for example, the fact that if the same export proposal were to terminate at the Port of Prince Rupert—where North America’s second-largest deep harbour opens directly into deep, open ocean as opposed to navigating hundreds of kilometres through the inside marine waters of BC and Washington State—instead of at Burnaby, opposition to it would be considerably, maybe even vitally, less. The UCP’s crisis narrative— replete with warnings of ‘Balkanization’ and threats of separatism—simply ignores the fact that many West Coast opponents to TMX aren’t so much against bitumen development or export per se, but rather to the route proposed. It doesn’t matter to JKKK if a West Coaster supports dilbit export, just not through TMX but Prince Rupert instead: he or she will still be cast as a selfish, hypocritical, undemocratic, ‘rule-of-law’ breaking, pointy-eared dupe of shadowy, international environmental terrorists who deserves to be Balkanized as mercilessly as possible.

Scheer offers the prospect of using corridored, NEP 2.0 electricity, too. The palpable element of revenge of course harkens back to NEP 1.0, Alberta’s de rigueur lodestone of fed-bashing (personified by any Trudeau who might be Prime Minister at the time). Back in premier Lougheed’s day of real Toryism, the issue wasn’t so much government interference in free markets—he was defending Alberta’s sovereignty which, to the real Tory mind, grants the jurisdiction to skim off a tidy royalty from the conventional oil industry and save it in a Heritage Fund in anticipation of the day when the oil runs out, the profitability of bitumen mining —without massive government subsidies of which real conservatives would have disapproved—was then still a question. The worldwide usurpation of Tory polities by stateless neoliberals (which summarily swapped Adam Smith for Gordon Gecko) ushered in a totally unTory era when sovereignty defers to capitalism (instead of the other way around) and government intervention in the economy—such as Scheer’s NEP 2.0 envisions— is rather intended to bankrupt the state so it’s forced by penury to acquiesce to the demands of “international investors”—the guys whom the state’s weakened sovereignty cannot prevent or incent them from simply moving their money elsewhere, as we’ve heard ad nauseam ever since buying into NAFTA’s bill of goods.

Premier Lougheed’s opposition to NEP 1.0 was a matter of sovereignty, provincial versus federal, which harkened back to a quarter-century period when Alberta’s (with concurrently confederated Saskatchewan) federal relationship was truly unfair (it didn’t have full sovereignty over natural resources, the defining feature of provincial sovereignty-sharing with the feds; the discrepancy was remedied in the early 30s—before the Canadian Constitution was patriated in 1982– by an Act of the British Parliament). Most Albertans probably didn’t recall this historical vignette during the NEP 1.0 controversy, much less now looking back through the stack of lenses, NEP 1.0, TMX and, now, NEP 2.0. Neither Lougheed nor Scheer need Alberta voters to remember arcane constitutional arguments: they can avail one of the most potent narratological devices, the inheritance from father to son, here performed by PET and JT, to kaleidoscopically moulinex fact, fable, legend and myth into the superficial warpaint of slogan and paean.

That is, Scheer better hope nobody looks too closely at his NEP 2.0 proposal else it get waylaid by inconvenient truths: there surely is an international conspiracy afoot against combusting any kind of petroleum into the atmosphere but, far from sinister and secretive as the UCP government mischaracterizes it, it is dexterous and righteously overt; but that storyline doesn’t very well work with the UCP’s victim-card arc that shadowy, evil forces are covertly focusing on Alberta’s bitumen alone, unfairly singling it out. Albertans react so predictably to this fabulously maudlin, official propaganda that a naturally begrudging urban myth—of which the UCP government does not disabuse its citizens—that the province is not only being unfairly treated now, but has been all along which, inevitably further developed in the fora of cafes and bars, morphs into the notion that, therefore, Alberta has been unfairly taxed all along, and thence to the attitude that Canada actually owes Alberta large for every perceived sleight. It’s entirely the UCP’s fault, as coordinator of the ant-carbon tax, conservative provincial confederacy, at propagator of fact-free, ‘praise-the-lord-pass-the-ammo’ paeans that the ROC-IQ (-Including Quebec) looks at Alberta this way.

By signing on to this growing, increasingly singular narrative, Scheer risks getting run over by snowballing codswallop. If his proposed NEP 2.0 corridor must be expropriated from provincial territory, he’s gonna need some cooperation; threading NEP 2.0 through BC and Quebec, both of which have opposed dilbit-piping (although BC is uniquely concerned with dilbit spills from supertankers plying its busy inside marine waters, unlike Quebec which simply opposes a pipeline traversing its jurisdiction), will present, as the ancient Chinese curse says, “very interesting times” considering in neither province have the feds come anywhere close to meeting the constitutional obligation to treat with indigenous nations, a nut his predecessor failed to crack despite bending every rule and gaming every system in trying. Last I checked, the former Reform-a-CRAP-a-Con party have outstanding issues with West Coasters, First Nations, Quebec and New Brunswick (proposed Atlantic terminus of the NEP 2.0, dilbit pipeline), having labeled them, respectively, ‘enviro-terrorists’, ‘veto-drunk’ Aboriginals, ‘treasonous Separatists’ and regionally attitudinal ‘defeatists’. The NEP 2.0 corridor better be piping some honey for Andrew’s sake. Plan Bee.

But an election campaign is either a great time to rhetorically reconcile these differences or varnish them over with slogans and paeans, the former offering the slight chance of achieving something laudable, sometime, many mandates of compromise and cooperation in the future from now— maybe—the latter guaranteed to antagonize and deprive the very regions and factions of political support requisite for the CPC to win government. Andrew’s dimples will be working overtime to get astride both of these narrative streams, kinda like sore cheeks from laughing at hallucinations during a beer-soaked acid trip, at once profound, inexplicable and hilarious.

Like “Xavier Trudeau”.

PS not wanting to risk falling into one of the ubiquitous narrative-traps mined around the bitumen issue, I should like to add that the bitumen industry’s future is uncertain only insofar as its end use is combustion into the atmosphere. If it were up to me, scientists and engineers would be working like the devil right now to develop non-fuel uses for Alberta’s gigantic resource of petrochemicals— which is just a little tidbit that gets lost in subtle manipulations of the UCP/CPC crisis/corridor narrative.

There would have to be a change in the constitution for electricity to be a federally controlled commodity allowing an east-west corridor. Yes the old BNA Act and subsequent amendments. At present, a province can insist that “hydropower” (electricity) from a neighbouring province must be sold to it, and then if it feels like it, be resold to another province or country at whatever price it negotiates with a customer. Why do you think Churchill Falls electricity from Labrador wasn’t sold directly to New York State by NF and Lab, passing through Quebec on its own transmission line? Not allowed by Quebec. Quebec buys it and sells any excess to NY State. Manitoba Hydro sells a little to Ontario, a lot to Saskpower and a lot to the US – it cannot sell direct to Alberta across Saskarchewan territory. that’s why Manitoba Hydro sells a lot to the US, a bit to Ontario and a lot to SaskPower — they’re immediate neighbours. To quote Manitoba Hydro: “Our major utility customers are: Great River Energy; Minnesota Power; Northern States Power; SaskPower; Wisconsin Public Service.” Are they going to break contracts with the US companies to humour Andy Scheer or Farmer Brian?

All these numbnuts pols think oh! That’s easy, an east-west electricity corridor, until they get into the details of provincial rights.

BTW, DJC — do you meant Saint John, NB or St John’s NF? There’s a reason the two are spelled differently and have been from well before NF joined Confederation in 1949. To avoid confusion. There is no St John on the East Coast.

It turns out anyone can stick up anything they like in the windows of the stately and historic Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton and they won’t be breaking any rules.

This even includes Matt Wolf, Jason Kenney’s personal twitter troll, formally known as the Alberta premier’s director of issues management, who during last Friday’s climate action protest could be seen peering past an I-[HEART]-[MAPLE LEAF]-Oil+Gas sign at the 4,000-plus mostly youthful demonstrators below.

The explanation: There are no rules.

This must make the granite and sandstone Beaux Arts pile overlooking the North Saskatchewan River Valley, completed in 1913 at the then substantial cost of $2 million, unusual and possibly unique among major public buildings just about anywhere.

I imagine it would make the three architects who had a hand in its design — Allan Merrick Jeffers, Richard Blakey, and Percy Nobbs — spin like tops in their crypts if they knew!

But there it is. I have this on very good authority. Lianne Bell, chief of staff to Speaker Nathan Cooper, responded to my query about the rules for signage informatively and succinctly yesterday: “There are no rules or guidelines around signage in windows of the Legislative Building.”

End of story? Probably not.


Opposition Leader Rachel Notley at last night’s NDP pre-budget town hall in St. Albert (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Opposition Leader Rachel Notley, at a pre-budget town hall in St. Albert last night, observed that “there were four thousand people who were talking about the future of our planet out there and all our leadership could do was put up signs trolling them from the safety of the inside of the cabinet room!”

“Frankly, I think you should go out and talk to protesters,” she said, recalling the days when she was premier and her NDP government’s farm-safety legislation was unpopular with many farmers. “We had 1,000 people protesting when we introduced legislation to protect farm workers, and our ministers and MLAs went out and spoke to people.”


Alberta Speaker Nathan Cooper (Photo: David J.Climenhaga).

She noted that she couldn’t recall a similar example of political staff or politicians posting signs in the more than a decade she’s been a member of the Legislature, and dismissed the absence of any UCP ministers or MLAs in the crowd as cowardice.

Ms. Notley is certainly right that sophomoric displays of partisan signs in the building are highly unusual, and nothing much controversial in this vein seems to have happened since interlopers unknown lowered a Bolshevik banner from the Press Gallery of the Legislative Chamber onto the Speaker’s throne in the 1920s.

Of course, the Legislature is pretty much the fiefdom of the Speaker, so Mr. Cooper can make any rule he likes if he perceives that MLAs or their staffers are starting to go bolshie.

And with friends like Mr. Wolf in the building, that might not be a bad idea. As soon as word there are no rules starts to get around — sorry about that, mea maxima culpa — it wouldn’t be surprising if the premiers’ boys in short pants start carving their initials in the sandstone.

Notley on that Ambassadorial rumour: ‘I’m staying on until the next election’


In the foreground, the Canadian Embassy in Washington (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

While Ms. Notley was in St. Albert, I took the opportunity to ask her about Mr. Wolf’s pre-federal-election creative writing on Twitter to the effect a re-elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will name her ambassador to Washington.

While many of us might think Ms. Notley would do a fine job for Canada in such a role, it’s just not on, she assured me. “I’ve been very clear. I’m staying on until the next election.

“That’s what I said election night, that’s what I’ve been saying to everybody since. I’m flattered that the UCP wants me to go so much, but unfortunately for them it’s my plan to stay around and stand up for Albertans.”

It’s interesting, she added, that the premier’s issues management guy — salary, $194,253 per annum; Twitter followers, 1,222 — “is so worried about my future that he’s actually dedicating time to trying to create groundless rumours.”","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

It’s unfortunate that some of the grown ups inside the building did not set a better example for the young people outside. However, I guess there is a reason they call them the boys in the short pants and it has something to do with exactly this sort of childish behavior by people old enough to know better, but drunk on their own self perceived power.

Its also not surprising they hunkered down inside and did not bother to go talk to the young people there. After all, Alberta’s Conservative government did not make such a big pretence about being “for the people” as its Ontario PC cousins did. It’s not surprising as one of the first promises Mr. Kenney broke was his own grassroots guarantee and UCP came to be called the used car party, a party more attuned to business and industry association interests than anything else.

Unfortunately their arrogance and contempt for differing views was clearly on display in the windows of the Legislature that day. I suspect Mr. Kenney realizes to some extent the importance of image even if his adolescent acting aides do not. He might want to get the Speaker to talk to them and set some rules, before they become more embarassing to the province.

Cowardice it is. And a fair dollop of ignorance.

It’s become more than a little obvious that those on the right, who in Canada call themselves conservatives, are simply lacking knowledge of the Canadian political system or of any other functioning political system extant. They are curiously, for such public figures, unaware and unlearned of such basic national economic policies such as trade, employment, taxation or budgeting. Also, as Notley pointed out, they are pathologically afraid of public scrutiny.

These people, for reasons of their own, are working for some other master than the public. From Trump to Scheer, Ford and Kenney they all are demonstrably more than a little willing to screw over the country and citizenry for a class of people comprising less than 1% of the population. They are nothing more than paid mercenaries.

We would all do well to remember, and review, events in Europe during the 1930’s.

It will confound your enemies and astound your friends.”

Excellent advice, it turns out, in this political season.


Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, in 1907 (Photo: Library of Congress).

The author’s advice was not just about lies of commission, though, but also about what to do when your lies of convenient omission suddenly turn out to be inconvenient.

But who knew that Bland Andy — by which I mean Andrew Scheer, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and aspirant for the prime ministership of our boreal dominion — would turn out to have a trunkful of dirty little secrets, with the emphasis on little?

Of all people! This is a guy so bland he worked as an insurance broker, for heaven’s sake!

Except, of course, he didn’t.

Indeed, this turns out to be one of those dirty little secrets. He wasn’t even an insurance salesman. He was barely the guy who ran the till at the insurance store. Maybe he got to sweep up sometimes just before the broker with the keys locked the doors.

Look, you can almost forgive a politician without much of a resume in an age that’s cynical about politicians who haven’t held “real jobs,” especially when they’re promising to drain the swamp, for wanting to make whatever jobs they had before getting elected sound more important than they really were.

But insurance broker? Obviously Mr. Scheer, at least until recently, was a man of small ambition. I mean, OK, nobody would have believed him if he’d said he used to be an astronaut, but surely he could have claimed to have been a chief executive officer or an institutional entrepreneur?

The latter job description is a coinage of Jason Kenney, another Conservative politician who never had a real job outside politics and who was still living in his mom’s basement when Mr. Scheer was raising five children in subsidized housing, albeit pretty nice subsidized houses. I heard Mr. Kenney say that with my own ears. He was talking about being the CEO of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. But, je digresse.


Michael Ignatieff the Liberal leader the Conservatives said was “just visiting” (Photo: Creative Commons).

Mr. Scheer could have said that he actually wanted to study molecular physics when he was in college if only he could have afforded the tuition for the PhD. Now that would have been a crackerjack political fib. Who could prove it wrong, after all? Plus, it would have played right into a great narrative working class guy who was really smart.

I mean, if you’re going to lie, you might as well lie with ambition, with imagination!

It’s when the truth is out, though, that things get sticky. And that’s where Mark Twain’s advice comes in.

Consider Justin Trudeau, the real prime minister who did have a real job, even if Conservatives as a class don’t seem to think very highly of schoolteachers. When he was discovered to have worn blackface and not told anyone about it, he owned right up to it, apologized convincingly, and the scandal seems more or less to have gone away even as new videos kept popping up.

When cornered, Mr. Scheer’s instinct, by contrast, was to fudge. We had seen this already with his mumbled refusal to apologize for his views on same-sex marriage, and the light taps on the wrist he delivers to Conservative MPs and candidates who utter racist or homophobic comments.

About that insurance broker’s licence he never got, he said, he was working on it, could have finished the course, but just didn’t have time. Or something. Not very memorable. Not very convincing.

But no biggie. After all, he graduated from the University of Regina … or maybe it was the University or Ottawa, or maybe …


Thomas Mulcair, the NDP leader the Conservatives excoriated for having dual citizenship (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Wait! Apparently the jury’s still out on that one. Maybe he does have a university degree. Maybe he doesn’t. Maybe it’ll turn up in the files.

While we were waiting for the verdict, though … this just in! Mr. Scheer, the man they call Stephen Harper with a smile, has dual Canadian and U.S. citizenship!

And Mr. Harper, of course, is the politician who went after Michael Ignatieff, the Liberal leader in 2011, for “just visiting” because he’d held prestigious posts at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard, and who ripped Thomas Mulcair, the NDP leader in 2015, for having … wait for it … dual citizenship.

This was never quite said aloud by the Conservatives, but it may be Mr. Mulcair’s problem with a lot of English Canadian voters was that his dual citizenship was with France, not with the United States.

Regardless, while this was happening, Mr. Scheer seems to have just sat there wearing that nice smile of his.

And what does Mr. Scheer do when he goes to tell the truth about his dual citizenship? He says that, ummm, no one asked about it.

This is like telling your girlfriend that, yeah, you have a wife… “But why are you mad, honey? I never mentioned it because you never asked!” This is not a formula for success, people.

Anyway, Mr. Scheer said, he was going to renounce his U.S. citizenship but the dog ate the paperwork. Or maybe it was that he hasn’t heard back from the U.S. consulate in Regina. Whatever, he’s working on it, OK?

So, now, we’re all waiting on the edge of our seats to see what the next little Andy Scheer fib to be exposed is.

This is what Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens, had in mind when he talked about telling the truth to astound your friends and, more importantly, confound your enemies.

Regarding the Liberals use of two airplanes during the election campaign, CBC News quoted Andrew Scheer. “I don’t buy Mr. Trudeau’s excuse that somehow purchasing more credits excuses him—gives him the privilege to burn more fuel.”

This argument is not new. Years ago when Justin and his brothers were children, his parents flew the family to Europe, included on the flight was their nanny. During question period a Tory member criticized Pierre for bringing along extra staff, thereby requiring the aircraft to burn more fuel. Pierre responded by suggesting that if the honourable member were to blow into the gas tank for the duration of the flight, the plane would save more than enough fuel to offset all passengers on board.

Justin could make the same offer to Andrew, thereby increasing the likelihood that only one aircraft would be needed for rest of the campaign.

Yeah, it’s actually kind of shocking how bad Scheer is at Politics 101 when he’s essentially a professional politician.

He writes a blog in 2005 or 2006 criticizing Michaelle Jean’s dual citizenship when she’s about to be chosen Governor-General. He watches his boss and mentor, Harper, criticize Mulcair for his dual citizenship and Ignatieff for having the audacity to work abroad as an academic in some of the world’s most prestigious universities.

Through all of that, Scheer never clues in that, should he have any ambition to climb out of the backbenches, he might want to do something about the dual citizenship. Quietly.

He becomes Speaker of the House. He runs for the party leadership and wins. Still nothing. By the time he clues in that maybe he should do something about it, it’s the August before an October election. One can only hope that whatever clerical work he performed at the insurance bureau was done with more dispatch and urgency than he handled his own personal affairs (and pre-political career).

And the thing is … there’s obviously nothing wrong with dual citizenship. In fact, in a lot of people, it’s the sign of an interesting family heritage, or an interesting life lived. Not in Scheer’s case, however. He’s not only not-interesting, he’s so not-interesting that, as Dave notes, he actually chose to brag about being … an insurance agent … to build up his private-sector street cred (kind of like Harper’s bio always included mention of his tour-of-duty Calgary oil company mailroom). And then it turned out he wasn’t really an insurance agent, but more like the front-counter person who hands you your new pink slips when you renew your policies once a year. Honest work – nothing wrong with it at all – but federal politics is quite a step up from that. He should have thank his lucky stars when he was on the backbench. Ask some house questions. Serve on a few committees. Vote when Harper tells you to. Fly back to Regina in time for Rider games on the weekend. Ten years later, retire and live off the pension. But that damn Speaker’s Chair has a way of feeding the ego.

Now? He’s an underqualified insurance clerk with an unremarkable 15-year legislative record running for PM who’s now got to talk about … in the middle of a damn election … signing up for the U.S. armed services draft and, probably, show us some tax returns he would have had to have filed in the U.S. as a condition of citizenship (that reason alone is one a few of my friends with U.S. parents have never bothered to get dual citizenship – it’s a paperwork hassle).

Again – all things he should have dealt with years ago. Unfinished homework assignments, essentially. I haven’t made up my mind on Trudeau, but I’ll take a teacher over an insurance clerk anytime.

The idea of “dual citizenship” is fine in theory, but when the crunch comes, where are your loyalties? This is especially pertinent when it comes to defending Canadian national interests as a political leader. Almost the entire history and practice of US government and citizenship (and most other countries for that matter) is an insult to every basic Canadian value. As has been observed, nations have no friends, only other countries with shifting common interests.

Ah, the affinity of some Conservatives for MAGA hats, it all makes more sense now! It turns out Mr. Scheer is a closet American, which coincidentally at one time also had an official policy of don’t ask, don’t tell. I guess Scheer would fit right in with that.

I have a feeling this will not affect his popularity with the base too much, as many Conservatives seem to have an affinity for the US, although some not as much for Mr. Trump. However, at least it wasn’t revealed that Mr. Scheer was a secret close relative of Mr. Trump, although at this point one can never be sure what surprising revaluations might yet come out. In any event, Mr. Scheer was quite good in keeping secrets at least until now. However, I have a feeling this might have more impact on the 5 – 10% of voters who tend to waver between the Conservatives and the other parties and in a race this close that could be very damaging to their chances.

Its not so much that this revaluation is bad, many Canadians are ok with dual citizenship and it is not unheard of, however there are three troubling questions in this case. First, Mr. Scheer was planning on telling us this when – after the election? While it might not be the worst revelation, it is something that some might consider relevant and we should know about him. Second, it shows Mr. Scheer as not being very transparent. If he is keeping this from us, one wonders what else is he not revealing or trying to hide? Third, there is a Conservative hypocrisy on display here. The previous Conservative government (of which Mr. Scheer was a part of) made a big deal about the dual citizenship of two previous leaders of other parties and one former head of state. I suppose it played well to xenophobic elements in the party at the time. As far as I can tell not much has really changed in the Conservative Party. After the niqab debacle of the last campaign they probably learned to be a bit less overt about it, but with the departure of Mr. Kenney they probably are now focused a bit less on getting the votes of ethnic minorities. Perhaps some Conservatives will say this is different this time – the other dual citizens were with France, this is with the US. If that is the argument they make, that also says a lot about the Conservative Party.

Andrew Scheer is even less a dual citizen than was Ted Cruz. This whole controversy depends on the inability or deliberate ignorance in the electorate to understand the difference between holding dual citizenship and actually living as a dual citizen. Scheer passively gained American citizenship as a child, never held an American passport as an adult, never lived in the US, never worked in the US, never owned property in the US, never voted in the US. Presumably, he filed American taxes as the US is unique in requiring all citizens to file taxes even if they earned no income in the US or in a jurisdiction without tax reciprocity. Jean, Dion, Mulcair, Ignatieff etc. actively acquired dual citizenship as adults, pledging loyalty to other countries, and in some instances lived, worked or owned property abroad. Previous Conservative attacks were surprisingly not specific enough in differentiating between active and passive citizenship. They were part of bigger narratives such as portraying Ignatieff as “just visiting”, or Jean, Dion, Mulcair as beholden to Quebec nationalism. Of course the Liberal hate machine will portray Scheer’s parentage as proof of his links to Trump, Republicans, the NRA, private healthcare etc. Scheer’s only misstep, a stupid one, was not coming clean earlier. Yes the Conservatives appear as hypocrites, but nowhere near at the magnitude of the greener and woker than thou PM who fires women who don’t follow his corrupt direction, blames societal racism for his own blackface performances and travels with a bigger carbon footprint than the Rolling Stones.

Loyalty is generally expected of all citizens, whether born or naturalized. This is exactly why dual citizenship is a concern especially for those that aspire to high political office. As a child, Scheer may not have realized the implications of it, but once you are an adult you can no longer hide behind your parents actions or choices and Mr. Scheer has been an adult now for many years.

I’ve probably paid more attention to the CTF than almost anyone on the left in Canada and the simple answer is, no, they are not a taxable charity. So, donors do not get a tax break for donating directly to the CTF. This also enables the organization to keep the identities of its contributors secret. However, some donations likely come their way from charitable foundations associated with right-wing funding, and there is a revolving door of former CTF staffers moving back and forth through several organizations closely associated with the CTF. As far as I know, unlike the Manning Foundation of which their former CEO is now president, they do not have a separate charitable foundation. I would keep an eye out for a development of that sort, however. DJC

Two points:1) As any hard-core Trekker would know, in the picture, Mr Scheer is clearly wearing a Next Generation-era Starfleet uniform, at a time when command-level officers wore red, not gold.

2) On a more serious note: the US citizenship oath calls upon the person to swear to “absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen”. But Members of Parliament, Senators, Cabinet Ministers and PMs have to swear an oath of allegiance to “be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors.” Last time I checked, the Queen, being a direct descendant of that self-same King George III against whom the 18th-century American Insurrection was fought, is a “foreign prince or potentate”; so, these two oaths would seem to be in direct contradiction to one another, and one cannot honour one without breaking the other. So, there’s that …

Regrettably, the biggest problem with Justin Trudeau is that he lacks his father’s ability for being proud of his extraordinary ass-HO-lery. PET always had an amazing retort for any assault, personal or otherwise. Like time that, in the HofC, PET sexuality was questioned by one of those Western Canadian Tories. (The ones that are painted blue.) This was before his sensational marriage to wild-child Margaret, PET had to endure many catcalls about his manliness. Considering he actually believed that “the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation”, and that there were throngs of young women chasing him everywhere, one can see all those frustrated Tories getting their collective knickers in a knot over sexy Pierre. After one challenge too many, PET stood in the HofC and responded to that Tory’s demented inquiry that, “I strongly believe that your wife would find me far more entertaining than she finds you.” (And “fuddle-duddle.) I mean the dude dated Barbara Streisand, Liona Boyd, Margot Kidder, and Christine LaGoude. (Her name escapes me but she was the stunning Radio-Canada journalist that PET really wanted to marry.)

Anyway, Justin may not be his father because he wants to be liked too much. PET was a jerk and proud of it.

68,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Environmental Defence study concludes Canada’s emissions would soar if CAPP’s wish list were granted,2019-10-07 00:21:00,David Climenhaga,,"Research published this morning by Environmental Defence Canada concludes adoption of the powerful Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers lobby group’s election wish list would increase Canadian greenhouse gas emissions by 116 million tonnes of CO² by 2030.

“In that scenario, Canada’s oil and gas sector would be emitting 311 million tonnes, making emissions from that one industry representing one-fourteenth of the Canadian economy greater than the emissions of 170 countries in the world,” the report stated.

This goes to the respected Toronto-based environmental group’s assertion well-funded fossil fuel industry lobbying is the single biggest barrier to effective climate action being taken by Canada.

“Oil and gas companies haven’t just played an outsized role in emitting GHGs and accelerating climate change,” said the report, which was put together for Environmental Defence Canada by the EnviroEconomics research organization. “Their lobbying efforts have also contributed to weakening existing environmental policies and killing or delaying proposed climate policies.”

The report noted that academic research shows corporate fossil fuel lobbyists met with Canadian government officials about 11,000 times between 2011 and 2017. That’s eleven thousand times — not a typo.

Fossil fuel industry lobbying sought to weaken or kill six important areas of environmental protection, the report said: environmental assessment rules, water protection, carbon-pricing policies, methane controls, impact assessment, and clean fuel standards.

The report also accuses some of Canada’s major fossil fuel companies of using subsidiaries in foreign tax havens to avoid taxes, although the researchers said they were unable to estimate the amount of money that may have been squirrelled away abroad.

If CAPP’s wish list were granted after the Oct. 21 federal election , Environmental Defence Canada said, GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector “would use 60 per cent of Canada’s 2030 carbon budget under the Paris Agreement.” It noted that the sector, despite its power and influence, represents 7 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product and 1.3 per cent of Canada’s employment.

The report also noted that between 2000 and 2018, while oil production in Canada has increased by 80 per cent, royalties paid by the sector have plummeted by 63 per cent and the corporate taxes it pays have fallen by more than half.


Former Alberta Liberal Leader Kevin Taft (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Canadians should demand that federal party leaders explicitly reject the dangerous agenda being pushed by the oil and gas lobby,” said Environmental Defence Executive Director Tim Gray in a statement accompanying the report. Mr. Gray is a former executive director of the Ontario chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and has a reputation for being a stickler for accuracy in research.

It will be interesting to see how both CAPP and Alberta’s United Conservative Party Government’s “War Room” react to this criticism from a credible organization.

The belligerent tactics adopted by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, and the implication his government will hound opponents of the oil industry through lawsuits, inquiries, Trumpian Twitter storms and other techniques to suppress their free expression rights suggests the credibility of the industry with the Canadian public is waning, not the opposite.

Nevertheless, it isn’t exactly news that that CAPP and other corporate fossil fuel lobby groups continue to wield a lot of influence over policy makers and have essentially, as former Alberta Liberal Leader Kevin Taft argued in his 2017 bestseller Oil’s Deep State, “captured” the government of Alberta regardless of which party is in power at any time.

“A swath of Alberta’s important democratic institutions have been captured by the oil industry,” Dr. Taft wrote in a guest post on this blog two years ago. “I spent 11 years in the Legislature and all the major political parties — sometimes even the PCs — asked tough questions about royalties, the environment, and reclamation. Now there is barely a murmur, not because these issues have been solved but because political parties have become instruments of the industry.”

Toward the end of former prime minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative federal government, which hoped to transform Canada into an “energy superpower” despite growing concern about global warming, Environmental Defence Canada’s charitable status was attacked by the Canada Revenue Agency for opposing the government’s pipeline policies.

Before moving from Ottawa to Alberta, Mr. Kenney was a senior minister in Mr. Harper’s cabinet and a trusted lieutenant of the prime minister.

The audit of Environmental Defence Canada by the CRA, which had been thoroughly politicized by the Conservative Government, was based on a complaint by EthicalOil.org, the pro-oilsands pressure group founded by Ezra Levant that has many informal links to both the Conservative Party and the fossil fuel industry.

Environmental Defence Canada never lost its charitable status, however. In December 2018, the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced new legislation dealing with charitable status and political activity. Under the new law, charities were permitted to devote unlimited resources to public policy dialogue and non-partisan activities for the purpose of furthering their charitable mandates.

Conservative Party and UCP supporters and oil industry boosters have conspiracy theories to explain this policy decision. However, a simpler and more likely explanation is the implications of the ruling by the Ontario Superior Court the previous July that the CRA’s audits of political activity by charities infringed on Canadians’ constitutional right to free expression.

About 60 charities were targetted by the CRA before Justice Edward Morgan’s decision effectively ended the practice. The federal government dropped an appeal of the ruling in February 2019","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

Amidst all the fooferaw from the UCP about so-called “foreign-funded special interests” attacking our fossil fuel industry for nefarious purposes, such as — this is a whopper — constraining Alberta oil & gas to limit market competition to American oil & gas, have a read through this article in The Smithsonian: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/meet-the-money-behind-the-climate-denial-movement-180948204/

The size & scope of American conservatives’ efforts to buy FUD (fear, uncertainty & doubt) about the need to deal effectively with anthropogenic climate change is breathtaking, and also dwarfs anything that might be coming from the environmental movement.

11,000 times! OMG!

Ok, maybe it’s time governments start charging fees. You want to meet with a Minister or whatever. You gotta plop down $10,000. Apparently that’s the going rate the Globe and Mail is charging now for a session with it’s editorial board and assorted bureau chiefs.

Of course, these fees would be added to the National Treasury. Let’s see, 11,000 x 10,000 = a lot of solar power technology.

Some of the biggest oil and gas companies are embroiled in legal disputes with cities, states and children over the industry’s role in climate change. (SEE LINK BELOW)

Like their market-fundamentalist big pharma business colleagues, oil and gas producers are facing major lawsuits — now working their way through U.S. courts — over climate change and the disruption caused by fossil fuels. Recent court judgements and settlements against opioid producers should be cause for concern for O & G producers. If cases succeed against the O & G industry, what happens to those conservative conspiracy theorists, along with their messaging and war room strategies, that champion false narratives denying environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases? Care to wager a guess?

The oil & gas industry has certainly captured NDP leader Rachel Notley.
“Rachel Notley not sure she’ll vote NDP in federal election”
“Alberta’s former NDP premier says she hasn’t committed to voting NDP in the upcoming federal election.”
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/notley-federal-ndp-vote-jagmeet-singh-pipeline-trans-mountain-opposition-1.5308758

Notley’s public repudiation of federal NDP leadership and climate/energy policy cannot sit well with national party members. What do long-time NDP supporters make of this?
If Notley’s vote depends on pipelines, whom will she vote for? Not the NDP or Greens, obviously. Notley also staunchly opposes the Liberal’s tanker ban (Bill C-48) and environmental review legislation (Bill C-69).
Perhaps Notley would feel more at home in Andrew Scheer’s party. The Conservatives can’t get enough pipelines.
Who else can she vote for? Maxime Bernier People’s Party?
Will AB NDP supporters ever wake up and realize Notley has led them down the garden path?

Very good article as usual. Detailed and thorough.

Kenney is beyond redemption. Perhaps sending a copy to Ms Notley’s aerie in the clouds would help enlighten her. One could but hope. I fear she is an obstinate person, however.

As things stand, only the federal NDP and the Greens seem to have any clue on the Environment. Trudeau claims he’s an environmentalist, but we know he suffers from cognitive dissonance on this dilbit issue in much the same vein as does Notley. I object strongly to the ruination of my country for the benefit of corporate bottom lines of both Canadian and foreign companies and the glorification of Jason Kenney, and for no other reason.

Perhaps if Alberta made an absolute mint on the tarsands and shared the wealth I could become blind to its dangers by being bribed to look the other way. As it stands, selling third rate quality dilbit as “oil” commands low prices, virtually no royalties and a heaping helping of pollution, both in the air and tailing ponds. I’m fed up to kowtowing to Alberta. 100 million tonnes of CO2 was supposed to be their cap, but greed now demands a further 116 million by 2030. These petro people need a comeuppance, and soon.

As I said earlier, the conservatives in Canada, federally and provincially, have nothing for citizens. They are entirely shills and mouthpieces for corporations and only see citizens, if at all, as malleable dupes to support and fund their duplicitousness.

Much can, and should, be said about the Liberals and the Greens, and the NDP but at least they are honestly focused on the welfare of people. They all can do better and should not stumble and fumble around as much or at all.
But the conservatives are another type altogether; they are ignorant and short-sighted, mean and vicious and will cause harm to you and everything you hold dear.

So the oil producers want to produce more oil, go figure… our politicians are bought and paid for, another surprise.
Even if you are not entirely convinced of man made global warming, global cooling, climate change, or whatever the latest call to action seems to be you should be concerned about the water pollution issue. 99.7 percent of lakes and 99.9 percent of rivers are excluded from federal oversight! Begs the question what does fall under federal oversight then? Don’t think Trudeau touched that one, correct me if I am wrong. Water is pretty bloody important.

67,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,What was Rachel Notley suggesting when she said she’s not committed to voting for Jagmeet Singh’s New Democrats,2019-10-08 00:35:00,David Climenhaga,,"Responding to former Alberta NDP premier Rachel Notley’s remark last week that she hasn’t committed to voting for Jagmeet Singh’s New Democrats in her own federal riding, a young Albertan named Reakash Walters tweeted from Ontario: “I have never felt so out of touch from Alberta politics than right at this moment.”

Well, you don’t have to be living outside Alberta to feel out of touch with Alberta politics nowadays.


Ms. Walters nominates Rachel Notley as the NDP candidate in 2015, shortly before the NDP’s historic majority victory (Photo: Provided by Reakash Walters).

Ms. Walters isn’t just some random tweeter troubled by Ms. Notley’s comment and wondering what the former premier is suggesting voters in Edmonton Strathcona should do.

In 2015, she was one of Ms. Notley’s two nominators in the Edmonton-Strathcona provincial riding. Later that year, she launched an impressive campaign to be the federal NDP’s candidate in Edmonton Centre.

When this articulate and intelligent young candidate was defeated, she reacted gracefully, urging her supporters to stick with the party. She is now attending law school at the University of Ottawa.

She’s likely to have a stellar career. I hope she decides to run for public office again. If she does, I’d advise the NDP to pay closer attention.

“As one of two people who nominated Rachel in 2015,” she told me yesterday, “I am truly disappointed in the direction the provincial party has taken and that they have chosen to prioritize oil extraction in the middle of a climate crisis.”

Ms. Notley is not just any former premier either, for that matter. She is leader of the Opposition in the Alberta Legislature. She represents the provincial riding with the same name, if not exactly the same boundaries, as the federal electoral district she votes in.


Rachel Notley in 2019 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Her provincial government caucus worked hard to ensure Heather McPherson was chosen as the federal NDP’s candidate in the face of an insurgent campaign by a young environmentalist named Paige Gorsak. And Edmonton Strathcona is the only riding in Alberta that can elect a New Democrat in 2019, and possibly the only one in Alberta that may be inclined to elect a non-Conservative MP.

So, just what is Ms. Notley saying? That because she doesn’t agree with Mr. Singh’s policy on pipelines maybe Alberta shouldn’t have a voice in the NDP Caucus in Ottawa, or the opposition generally, after Oct. 21?

And what does she think voters in Edmonton Strathcona should actually do about it? Vote for the Liberal and split the vote so a Conservative can win? Or go right out and vote Conservative, for crying out loud?

These are rude questions, I know. We’ve all been kind of reeling since we heard Ms. Notley’s comment. But they need to be asked. And those of us who have long supported the NDP and want to know the answers are entitled to an explanation.

If voters in Edmonton Strathcona want my advice, it is that they should ignore Ms. Notley’s post-election ennui and get the hell out and vote for Ms. McPherson, which is the right thing to do for both Canada and Alberta.

Mr. Singh was diplomatic in his response to Ms. Notley’s cranky comment. He complimented her work as premier and vowed to try to win her support.


Energy journalist Markham Hislop (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Regardless of what Ms. Notley is trying to achieve, electing a Conservative in Edmonton Strathcona, which is the probable outcome of weakening the turnout for Ms. McPherson, means electing someone who supports the approach to economic development taken by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.

And Mr. Kenney, regardless of what kind of reception he gets while campaigning on our dime in friendly Ontario ridings for federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, is seriously on the wrong track if you want to do the right thing for Alberta.

If pipelines are indeed necessary for Alberta’s economic wellbeing, Ms. Notley has no need to be ashamed of the way she campaigned for them.

While the phrase “social licence” has fallen into disfavour thanks to Mr. Kenney’s relentless vilification of the idea, Ms. Notley’s social-licence approach to winning approval for pipelines from Alberta to the ocean was working. More importantly, it was the only approach that could work.


Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As energy journalist Markham Hislop argued in a recent story on his EnergiMedia website, the current generation of leaders in the Alberta oilpatch are making a big strategic mistake that will hurt Alberta and their industry when it leads to the opposite outcome from the one they desire.

Pointing to recent public opinion polling showing “a majority of Canadians are concerned about climate change … and only support more oil and gas development if their governments enact policies that speed up the energy transition and reduce emissions,” there is not much hope Mr. Kenney’s belligerence will change many minds on the West Coast or in Quebec.

But Alberta’s fossil fuel industry has thrown its lot in with Premier Kenney. “The new strategy is to bully … other provinces and opponents into submission,” Mr. Hislop writes.

The result will damage Alberta’s economy, not save it.

Meanwhile, south of the 49th Parallel, President Donald Trump will likely soon be gone. Face it, when more than half the population and the organs of state security have turned against a president, he’s done like dinner.

Media has not quite caught up. Mainstream journalists have gone from not giving President Trump enough credit for his political chops to giving him far too much.

When he is gone, the United States will quickly return to its new normal, which we had the chance to observe under the administration of President Barack Obama. This will not a particularly friendly environment for Alberta’s oil industry, Canada’s pipeliners, or blowhards like Mr. Kenney who, when it comes to dealing with the colossus next door in the age of renewable energy, doesn’t hold a very good hand.

In such circumstances, Canadians should probably worry less about having a Conservative Party leader who is a U.S. citizen than a premier in Alberta who wants to throw roadblocks in the way of action against climate change.

This is something Ms. Notley should think about too, as the Alberta Legislature resumes sitting today and she tries to puzzle out the best way forward for her party, Alberta and Canada, not to mention how she’s going to vote on Oct. 21, her resentments about the federal NDP’s current platform notwithstanding.

About that debate last night …

Readers will forgive me if I take a breath before concluding who “won” last night’s cacophonous federal leaders’ debate.

<p class=""p1"">Ms. Walters isn’t just some random tweeter troubled by Ms. Notley’s comment and wondering what the former premier is suggesting voters in Edmonton Strathcona should do.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2015, she was one of Ms. Notley’s two nominators in the Edmonton-Strathcona provincial riding. Later that year, she launched an impressive campaign to be the federal NDP’s candidate in Edmonton Centre.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When this articulate and intelligent young candidate was defeated, she reacted gracefully, urging her supporters to stick with the party. She is now attending law school at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p class=""p1"">She’s likely to have a stellar career. I hope she decides to run for public office again. If she does, I’d advise the NDP to pay closer attention.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“As one of two people who nominated Rachel in 2015,” she told me yesterday, “I am truly disappointed in the direction the provincial party has taken and that they have chosen to prioritize oil extraction in the middle of a climate crisis.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ms. Notley is not just any former premier either, for that matter. She is leader of the Opposition in the Alberta Legislature. She represents the provincial riding with the same name, if not exactly the same boundaries, as the federal electoral district she votes in.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Her provincial government caucus worked hard to ensure Heather McPherson was chosen as the federal NDP’s candidate in the face of an insurgent campaign by a young environmentalist named Paige Gorsak. And Edmonton Strathcona is the only riding in Alberta that can elect a New Democrat in 2019, and possibly the only one in Alberta that may be inclined to elect a non-Conservative MP.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, just what is Ms. Notley saying? That because she doesn’t agree with Mr. Singh’s policy on pipelines maybe Alberta shouldn’t have a voice in the NDP Caucus in Ottawa, or the opposition generally, after Oct. 21?</p>
<p class=""p1"">And what does she think voters in Edmonton Strathcona should actually do about it? Vote for the Liberal and split the vote so a Conservative can win? Or go right out and vote Conservative, for crying out loud?</p>
<p class=""p1"">These are rude questions, I know. We’ve all been kind of reeling since we heard Ms. Notley’s comment. But they need to be asked. And those of us who have long supported the NDP and want to know the answers are entitled to an explanation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If voters in Edmonton Strathcona want my advice, it is that they should ignore Ms. Notley’s post-election ennui and get the hell out and vote for Ms. McPherson, which is the right thing to do for both Canada and Alberta.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mr. Singh was diplomatic in his response to Ms. Notley’s cranky comment. He complimented her work as premier and vowed to try to win her support.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Regardless of what Ms. Notley is trying to achieve, electing a Conservative in Edmonton Strathcona, which is the probable outcome of weakening the turnout for Ms. McPherson, means electing someone who supports the approach to economic development taken by Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And Mr. Kenney, regardless of what kind of reception he gets while campaigning on our dime in friendly Ontario ridings for federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, is seriously on the wrong track if you want to do the right thing for Alberta.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If pipelines are indeed necessary for Alberta’s economic wellbeing, Ms. Notley has no need to be ashamed of the way she campaigned for them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While the phrase “social licence” has fallen into disfavour thanks to Mr. Kenney’s relentless vilification of the idea, Ms. Notley’s social-licence approach to winning approval for pipelines from Alberta to the ocean was working.

<p class=""p1"">Pointing to recent public opinion polling showing “a majority of Canadians are concerned about climate change … and only support more oil and gas development if their governments enact policies that speed up the energy transition and reduce emissions,” there is not much hope Mr. Kenney’s belligerence will change many minds on the West Coast or in Quebec.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Alberta’s fossil fuel industry has thrown its lot in with Premier Kenney. “The new strategy is to bully … other provinces and opponents into submission,” Mr. Hislop writes.</p>

<p class=""p1"">In such circumstances, Canadians should probably worry less about having a Conservative Party leader who is a U.S. citizen than a premier in Alberta who wants to throw roadblocks in the way of action against climate change.</p>

I think our former premier understands the political climate here well. For those that don’t, I can sum it up in three words – Pipelines to tidewater. We do live in a political bubble and I know putting all our electoral eggs in the Conservative and energy baskets is not necessarily wise, especially in the long term, but that is where Alberta is at now politically.

The politicians who benefit most from this dangerous short term thinking, well I am certain they will be off to greener, bigger pastures in two years or less. By the time Alberta realizes the pickle it has put itself in, they will be gone, but they will use the temporary boost in popularity their appeal to populism gets as a launch pad to the next big job. Opportunists take advantage of opportunities that arise, that’s what they do. I believe they used to be called carpet baggers and other things

Once the grifters and UCP con men and their camp followers mostly go back to Ottawa, the Alberta NDP may yet again have to clean up the Conservative mess here. However, the chances of that happening are better if someone of our former Premier’s calibre is leading them.

The election debate reminds me of one or two of Klein’s. The incumbent was pummeled on all sides, but somehow survived. Well Mr. Scheer sure didn’t seem like Harper with a smile in the debate, more like a surly version of Harper. Scheer seemed to perform the role of opposition leader fairly well. Accordingly, I suspect the voters will let him keep that job.

The dilemma for Rachel Notley & her ANDP caucus is this: in terms of energy & the environment, they’re probably more closely aligned with the Trudeau Liberals than with either the Federal NDP or the Greens … but on everything else, they’re probably largely in line with Mr Singh. So, it’ll be a matter of deciding, are they one-issue voters, with that issue being pipelines — in which case they’ll probably hold their noses & vote Liberal — or will they take a broader perspective?

Ms. Notley needs to be shown the door before she does any more damage to the AB NDP.
Again, I must ask: What do long-time NDP supporters make of Notley’s public repudiation of federal NDP leadership and climate/energy policy?

If Notley’s vote depends on pipelines, whom will she vote for? Not the NDP or Greens, obviously. Notley also staunchly opposes the Liberal’s tanker ban (Bill C-48) and environmental review legislation (Bill C-69).
Perhaps Notley would feel more at home in Andrew Scheer’s party. The Conservatives can’t get enough pipelines.
Who else can she vote for? Maxime Bernier People’s Party?
Will AB NDP supporters ever wake up and realize Notley has led them down the neoliberal garden path?

There is no “climate crisis” it’s the latest iteration of a propaganda campaign that began with “global warming” and proceeded to adapt new clothing every time there was a scandal. The latest is “climate emergency” which employs climate shock doctrine: claim every adverse weather event “proves” you are right and exploit the hysteria. Greta Thunberg’s parents are millionaires specializing in entertainment and entertainment management. They first tried to get Swedish Television to do a series using their daughter when she was twelve. When SVT refused they embarked on the current scheme. In the climate of mass hysteria this sort of saviour figure is very effective. That does not indicate verity.

I applaud you, DJC. That must have been difficult to write considering all the circumstances, and I have nothing to add — you covered it all, and very well.

I listened on radio, and occasionally watched on TV in passing, the “debate”, as chores took me around the house. I cannot continually watch people’s faces perjuring themselves in public – I feel embarrassed both for them and my own sensibilities. Nixon started it for me. Hadn’t tuned in to a debate for ages, but this is an important time to keep tabs on what’s going on. The format was awful, and the moderation only one step above utterly useless, as expected.

The very first question was disregarded by Scheer who went off onto an anti-Trudeau tirade instead and wasn’t brought up short for it by the first moderator. In fact, I suppose one has to be a Con not to observe that their policies are almost non-existent beyond typical boiler-plate ideology. Cut taxes bring in austerity and halleluyah we’re all happy shiny people who read the Bible and obey orders from our corporate betters while consuming at non-sustainable rates. Scheer calls it a “real plan” – real dopey. I used to hear more clearly thought-out stuff than that at Model Parliaments almost 60 years at high school and then university. And a not very bright man like Scheer working himself up into a minor rage on others’ positions as interpreted by him, while spouting stupid lacklustre policy himself is a giant turnoff for me. Meanwhile, your local friendly completely smarmy and glib, in it only for himself, entirely un-empathetic psychopath Kenney is roaming around Ontario propounding nonsense on the Alberta taxpayer dime. Yes, I’ve read up on sociopaths and psychopaths and it is one of the latter, the Alberta premier that is. It roamed around Alberta organizing the UCP on the Federal government dime because it didn’t resign its seat while doing so. So the pattern was set. A complete shite.

One supposes it’s Gallic xenophobic logic that allows Blanchet to happily accept that 70% of Quebecers are racist and happy to cut the civil/human rights of people to wear religious symbol/clothing at work in public service, while being progressive on the environment. Of course, a lot of the latter is on the back of Newfoundland and Labrador’s Churchill Falls hydro at a penny a kWh. Quebec at its illogical best, I suppose. Quietly making the place unliveable for anybody but the native-born in a closeted society. Afeared of having their “culture” subsumed. It never seems to occur to Quebec politicians to “lead” and change the social discourse – they’re happy with the people’s bigotries.

Trudeau awarded himself the title of being Chief Environmentalist of Canada, but he’s been unable to grasp reality in much the same way Notley cannot. The same tired argument about flogging dilbit to get rich and then we’ll be able to rilly, rilly tackle environmental issues. A true pol. Full of nonsense and so full of himself he cannot understand that he’s done anything wrong, not met promises or that his logic is suspect. Its all tra-la-la in Liberal land.

I live in former NDP MP Stoffer’s riding, found him good, on point for veterans in a manner as Dutch and Northern French people liberated by us in WW2 would praise, and voted for him every time on the trot. Too bad he was dumped by the Red Wave for a nonentity whose main talent is collecting pay and standing up and sitting down on cue from the Liberal whip, all the while collecting valuable pension points. But then we found out Stoffer was a boozy misogynist despite being most popular MP etc. Oh well, more trust dashed on the shores of reality. Following Notley going off the deep end and ruining the NDP, I then transferred allegiance to the Greens, and my local candidate is a young aerospace engineer who has done well in provincial bye-election polling. Well hell, when an engineer, and I is one, can stand up for the environment and not be frowned upon as a radical, well, that’s good enough for me.

May is May and I respect her. Unwavering, but hampered by lack of party funds to come up with an immaculate logical party platform on the trot single-handedly, she holds her own. Got her dig in at JT and his illogic. Perhaps I might observe that a lot of fundamentalists have offered themselves up as Green Party candidates, without much of a clue about pragmatism. Idealists without a general focus as to how real implementation of real environmental policy would work – and stumbling over minutiae before understanding general policy issues. At least my candidate doesn’t follow that individual, often mythically-based, improbable and impractical outlook.

But the man who was a dignified unrattleable person was Jagmeet Singh. I am impressed. For me he easily outshone the rest of these people and that at a mere canter. Too bad he hid his light under a bushel for several years. Notley could take a tip or two from him but thinks far too much of herself to change. I’ll be following Singh’s fortunes closely in future.

Bernier should be committed or sent back to high school for remedial instruction – we could call it community service. A bewildered dolt who isn’t bright enough to work out why he’s bewildered. So mixed-up and out-of-it, no wonder May objected to his mere presence when she herself had been frozen out of “debates” for years. I still don’t get why we were subjected to Bernier’s ravings this time. Is he really a libertarian? Not sure he even knows what such attitudes are or mean. He doesn’t like immigrants regardless of whether they’re refugees, opportunists with a suitcase or actual legal entries — and I don’t like him.

My take, my biases. Everyone else is welcome to theirs.

Quite a bit of careening around since the headline on David’s blog.
As a Rachel Notley fan going back to her initial election to the Leg, I was struck numb if not dumb by her musings on her voting intentions. Unwise move on her part. Many NDPers in Alberta are caught in the pipeline/anti-pipeline dilemma. We can still support Notley and Jagmeet Singh, though. But to jeopardize the result in Edmonton Strathcona? That hurts. She just about has time to make amends. Here’s hoping.

I think you are overestimating how helpful Notley or the Alberta NDP can be to the federal NDP fortunes in this province. Didn’t even make much difference in 2015 when the Notley government was newly elected. The provincial results failed to translate to the federal level.

Meanwhile, publicly supporting the candidates of the federal NDP which is opposed to the Trans Mountain expansion would open her up to new lines of attack from the UCP. And they would have a point when you consider Rachel said getting a new pipeline built to tidewater was the fight of her political life just six months ago.

I think you are overestimating how helpful pushing pipelines can be to Notley’s or the Alberta NDP’s fortunes in this province.
Pushing pipelines didn’t stave off defeat for the AB NDP in last April’s election. The NDP lost more than half its seats. The NDP lost all of its rural seats. It was left with Fortress Edmonton and a mere handful of seats outside the capital.
There is no path to future NDP victory in AB thru pipelines.

Of course, we are not talking about “federal NDP fortunes in this province”. That’s a red herring. What’s at stake is the key seat in Edmonton Strathcona, held by the NDP since 2008.
Could Notley help the federal candidate in Edmonton Strathcona? If not, Notley doesn’t have much political capital in her own riding. But at the very least she could keep her own counsel. If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing.
Sabotaging federal NDP fortunes in Edmonton Strathcona does nothing to help the AB NDP. No right-wingers will give Notley any credit.
Notley’s swerve to the right only alienates her own supporters. Her antics grow more baffling by the day. Clearly not a team player.
The sooner the AB NDP show Notley the door, the sooner it can return to its progressive roots, and speak up for progressive Albertans and future generations on this most important file.

Mr Pounder: the world has once again returned to normal, & I once again find myself vociferously disagreeing with you & your environmental absolutism.

Recall Claude Legault, the CAQ Premier of Quebec, when he said there was “no social acceptability for oil pipelines through Quebec”? In fact, there is a solid consensus there: all parties — left, right or centre, sovereigntist, federalist, or nationalist — uniformly oppose any pipeline to the East coast.

Well, the reverse is true here in Alberta: there is no social acceptability for opposing pipelines here: every party — from the NDP to the Alberta Independence Party — was firmly, even desperately in favour of getting that pipeline to “tidewater”. Any party or politician who was not a vocal champion of TMX had ZERO chance of getting elected. The ballot question was not for or against the pipeline: it was what are you going to do to get it built, and what are the rest of your policy proposals along with it. When you look at the popular vote totals, especially outside the two major metropolitan centres — and the voter turnout — it’s pretty obvious there was no voter appetite for any candidate opposed to pipelines.

As for the federal election, I recently attended one of the Alberta NDP’s “Shadow Budget Town Halls”, where members of the Opposition NDP caucus toured around the province & met with members of the public to discuss their budgetary priorities for the next provincial budget. Ms Notley was not at the one I attended, but both MLAs that were there clearly & openly disagreed with the Singh-led Federal NDP on the pipeline issue; there was also a recently-unseated former rural NDP MLA in the crowd, who also held the portfolio of Energy Minister in the NDP government, and when she was invited to speak, she also spoke out in favour of getting a TMX built. So, it isn’t just Rachel Notley that is doubtful about their vote on Oct 21st … it’s virtually the entire ANDP caucus.

You might as well ask an American to oppose apple pie as ask any ordinary Alberta voter to oppose the pipeline.

If “environmental absolutism” means I respect the science and heed IPCC warnings (whereas Notley, Trudeau and Big Oil do not), I gladly accept the accolade.

No evidence that the support of NDP voters in 2015 hinged on pipelines. No evidence that long-time NDP supporters would reject Notley if she did not bang the drums for pipelines.
In 2015, with a split conservative vote, Alberta elected a NDP govt on a platform that included “climate leadership”, “a fair share” for Albertans on royalties, and opposition to new export pipelines like Keystone XL.

“[The PCs] squandered Alberta’s natural resource wealth, failed to achieve greater value-added processing in alberta, and have focused only on more export pipelines for unprocessed bitumen – sending our jobs to Texas.”
• http://www.poltext.org/sites/poltext.org/files/plateformes/alberta_ndp_platform_2015.pdf

Kevin Taft: “Through her whole career and her whole party, up until they became government, [Notley and the NDP] were very effective critics, counterbalances to the oil industry. As soon as she stepped into office, as soon as she and her party became government, they’ve simply became instruments of the oil industry.”

Post-election, Notley and her backroom advisors shifted the NDP’s position. No one fuelled pipeline hysteria more than Notley. If TMX became a key issue, it was Notley who made it so.
Of course, this strategy backfired on the NDP. Notley had no pipeline to show voters last April. Voters anxious for pipelines mostly voted UCP. No right-winger would give Notley credit even if she built a billion pipelines. If you want neoliberal energy/climate policies, may as well vote for the real thing. Notley played right into Kenney’s hands.

For once, I agree with Jason Kenney: “I’ve never believed there is a large number of Alberta voters whose ballot question is energy or pipelines who are likely to vote for the NDP. The NDP electorate is not people who get up in the morning passionate about pipelines and energy.”

You write: “Any party or politician who was not a vocal champion of TMX had ZERO chance of getting elected.”
This claim fails for lack of evidence. Show us the evidence.

You write: “Both MLAs that were there clearly & openly disagreed with the Singh-led Federal NDP on the pipeline issue.”
Do you suppose that MLAs under Notley have any choice but to follow the leader and toe the party line?
Albertans will never return the NDP to power on their pro-pipeline policies.
The AB NDP are chasing a chimera.

2) It’s a fallacy that pushing pipelines has aided AB NDP fortunes.
No one did more to fuel pipeline hysteria in this province than Notley. The same hysteria swept the NDP away in the April election. No one forced that blunder on Notley.
No one forced Notley to tie her carbon tax and fraudulent climate plan to new pipelines. No one forced Notley to prop up the oil industry, throw billions of dollars in subsidies out the window, and sabotage Canada’s climate efforts. That’s on her.

With no hopes for re-election against a united Conservative party, the NDP had nothing to gain by shifting right. Stoking Albertans’ perennial resentment over pipelines and everything else under the sun only helped the UCP.
Most pipeline boosters would not vote NDP if Notley built a billion pipelines. Notley only alienated progressives.
Pandering to the right was never going to win Notley a second term. Albertans who support neoliberal energy policies will just vote for the real thing.
Facing off against a united conservative party, Notley was always a one-term premier — but her alliance with Big Oil did nothing to help the NDP and the progressive cause in AB.

Naomi Klein (06-Feb-18): “Alberta has a left-wing political party in power, one that has somehow convinced itself it can beat the right by being a better suck up to Big Oil.”

Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour lashed out at the NDP govt on its failure to raise royalties:“At the heart of Mr. McGowan’s critique of the government’s announcement and the panel report that recommended it is the view it is both bad economics and bad politics. ‘Some people say the NDP have come face to face with reality. I say what happened can best be described as the government being captured by industry.’
‘I honestly think the government has made a profound political mistake. We don’t believe progressive governments have to become conservative to deal effectively with economic issues or to succeed politically. That’s a fallacy.
‘Virtually none of our concerns or suggestions are reflected in the royalty report. Those ideas were passed over in favour of a plan that could have been introduced by a PC or Wildrose government.'”
“Alberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan assails Notley Government’s royalty ‘mistake’”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney: “I’ve never believed there is a large number of Alberta voters whose ballot question is energy or pipelines who are likely to vote for the NDP. The NDP electorate is not people who get up in the morning passionate about pipelines and energy.”

David Climenhaga: “Indeed, the more [Notley] fights for the pipeline, the stronger Mr. Kenney seems to get because the file is seen, however wrongfully, by too many voters as a United Conservative Party strength.

David Climenhaga: Hoping the belligerent attitude demanded by Mr. Kenney’s Conservatives would persuade die-hard right-wingers to grant the NDP another term in office in gratitude for legislation that horrified many of its most loyal supporters was foolhardy.”

The more Notley fought for pipelines, the more she fanned the flames of anger among Albertans. Underlining her own failure on the file. All Albertans seemed to get out of the deal was a detested carbon tax. The blame for all our ills, real and imagined, fell upon Notley and Trudeau.
A pipeline project became the rallying flag for Albertans, whose sense of grievance against Ottawa burns eternal. Fuelling the right-wing rage machine.

Greg Fingas: “Notley’s enabling of oil and gas sector poor political strategy”
https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/notleys-enabling-of-oil-and-gas-sector-poor-political-strategy

Taft: “Through her whole career and her whole party, up until they became government, [Notley and the NDP] were very effective critics, counterbalances to the oil industry. As soon as she stepped into office, as soon as she and her party became government, they’ve simply became instruments of the oil industry.”

Taft: “The world is working hard to end its dependence on oil, so hitching the country’s economy to an industry that must be phased out is recklessly short-sighted.”

“[Donna Daum, a retired teacher] points out that members of the current NDP govt — including Premier Rachel Notley — were loud in their support when they were in opposition.
“‘(Notley) talked about the precautionary principle, which obviously is no longer in their dictionary. I can’t believe how these dictionaries get rewritten the moment there’s some responsibility attached to things.'”

In opposition, the NDP voiced support for a comprehensive healthy study on cancers in Fort Chipewyan. In govt, the only sound was crickets.
“[Allan Adam, chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation,] said his people continue to die from cancer at alarmingly high rates, a fact he blamed on oilsands developments. ‘Whatever food I’m bringing in from the bush, it is getting our people sick.’ The chief said he had hoped that after four decades of Conservative rule in Alberta, things would be different when the NDP government came to power in May 2015. But under the Rachel Notley government, he said, it’s business as usual. ‘I feel very, very ashamed to call myself an Albertan. I feel very, very ashamed to call myself a Canadian citizen.'” (January 2017)

“The talk around our table is that the NDP government is just another platform of the previous Conservative government with a different logo. Nothing has changed.” (Chief Allan Adam)

Dr John O’Connor: “Pre-election, the NDP/Rachel Notley were vocally supportive of bringing accountability and responsibility to bear on the environmental and health impacts,especially downstream, of the tarsands. After the AB Cancer Board report on Fort Chipewyan, she was notably outspoken on the need to comply with the recommendation for a comprehensive health study of Fort Chip, which was never even started.
“Now—it’s buried and forgotten. Such hypocrisy.”

As uncomfortable as this is for many NDP supporters including me, I’m with Rachel on this one.

Notley is an Alberta political leader. The last thing she or the Alberta NDP needs is giving new attack lines to the UCP. Which is exactly what would happen were she to publicly support the candidates of the federal NDP which is opposed to expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline. Especially when Notley called getting a new pipeline built to Pacific tidewater the fight of her political life less than six months ago.

John: A real leader would have exposed the TMX pipeline as the cargo-cult fraud that it is.

You state this as fact Kang, but you understand that it’s just your opinion, right? Having an opinion different from yours does not mean someone is not a leader – or does it?

Dear CamJ: A real leader deals with facts. The fact is that TMX is purportedly for exporting DilBit. DilBit is a lower quality product. The more lower quality product you pump into a world market with at best a soft demand for it, the lower the price you get.

Add in the high transportation cost of TMX compared to competitors selling essentially the same stuff, but who are much closer to tidewater and potential customers, and you have a formula for lower prices in Alberta.

Leading people down the garden path with the promise that TMX will improve the fortunes of the oil industry much less provide more jobs just does not fit with that economic situation. Saying it is a cargo-cult is being rather kind, I thought.

Facts? Kang, today’s price of your DilBit is $38.35 USD and today’s price of Mexican Maya which is a very similar heavy crude oil is $49.34 USD. This is why they want to get the DilBit to tidewater – at today’s prices and exchange rate they can get $14.50 CDN more per barrel. Now I’m not an oil company cheerleader and Alta should probably diversify it’s economy away from oil but let’s make better arguments than name-calling.

I know this thread is getting old but I just can’t let the fictional statements slide.

John Kolkman nailed it, count me with Rachel too, after all Mr. Singh that week repeated his opposition to TMX so what is she supposed to say? The question was certainly asked in order to stir up the issue and would supply ammunition to NDP opponents, both federal and provincial. I can relate to how Ms. Walters feels, I also have never felt so out of touch with the NDP as now. The list of anti-worker, anti-socialist positions taken by many of their representatives has made it harder for me to support them, but their party platform is very good and Jagmeet Singh is performing well. They deserve our support and I’ll bet my next paycheque that Rachel Notley feels this way too.

What Ms. Walter’s comment does “I am truly disappointed in the direction the provincial party has taken and that they have chosen to prioritize oil extraction in the middle of a climate crisis” is sweep aside all the good things the Alta NDP government did and brings it down to the one issue – which is exactly what Jason Kenny wants. The response from Mr. Singh to the comment was excellent (we can disagree on a specific issue but we are all doing good work) and came across as sincere rather than just political rhetoric. If Ms. Walters is interested in a political career she should pay attention to it.

DJC, you then do what so many journalists mistakenly do which is to interpret what people are thinking. There is no explanation required from Rachel Notley regarding your “rude questions” and you’re justifiably not going to get one. What she said was absolutely clear, “Notley said pitting economic security against combating climate change is a failure…”

Meanwhile south of the Medicine Line it looks to me like Donald Trump is going to get his second term. I don’t think that’s very good but I don’t see things happening that would change that – yet.

A televised leaders’ debate in a vibrant multi-party democracy like Canada? Not so much.


Mr. Scheer launches into his opening tirade about Mr. Trudeau, seconds into answering his first question (Photo: Screenshot).

For one thing, you have to invite the leaders of far-right fringe parties and regional separatist parties, which is not particularly interesting at best and disturbing at worst. Many of us witnessed all this Monday night for as long as we could stand it.

Nevertheless, such events can be made even more boring, unenlightening and distasteful through the adoption of a lame formula, something at which the organizers of Canada’s English-language debate for would be prime ministers and potential holders of the balance of power obviously exceeded expectations.

These exercises in tedium and disingenuity are probably a necessary evil. So we’re all just going to have to suffer through them every four years or so, praying for one of those dramatic moments when someone says something so cripplingly stupid a well-briefed interlocutor can swoop in for the kill.

Who can forget hapless Republican Dan Quayle, George H.W. Bush’s running mate, telling the 1988 vice-presidential debate in Omaha, Neb., that he would have more experience coming into office as president (in the unfortunate event Mr. Bush punched the proverbial ticket while on the job) than did John F. Kennedy? Equally memorable: the smirk on the face of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrats’ VP candidate, as he prepared to insert the banderillas:
“Senator, I served with JFK. I knew JFK. JFK was a friend of mine. Senator …” (beat… beat…)“you’re no Jack Kennedy!”


Democratic Party vice-presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen smirks as he waits to use the line he just thought up to utterly destroy Republican Dan Quayle in 1988 (Photo: Screenshot).

The cheers of the crowd were as much in admiration for the sheer joy of the slapdown as from base partisanship. Who says boxing is the sweet science?

Even then-Alberta-premier Jim Prentice’s famed “math is difficult” moment in 2015, as he defended his deceptive calculation of the size of a proposed NDP business tax increase, was such a moment. Not so much because of NDP Leader Rachel Notley’s evisceration of the man, though. She hardly bothered. It was her giggles at the stupidity of his remark that made the moment memorable.

So it was disheartening to hear Andrew Scheer’s response to the first question of the debate Monday afternoon was to pivot in mere seconds away from his answer to the actual query to delivering a tirade attacking prime minister Justin Trudeau as if it were one of those ripostes that, ever so infrequently, make debates momentarily interesting.

The question: “How would you effectively defend both the interests and the values of Canadians on the world stage?”

Mr. Scheer devoted 26 words to his answer. He then used the rest of his time to badmouth Mr. Trudeau for a litany of sins, real and imagined. “Mr. Trudeau, you’re a phoney, and you’re a fraud, and you don’t deserve to govern this country.”

This from a guy who lied on his resume, fibbed about his education, and somehow forgot to mention his citizenship status to Canadians!


Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley giggles at the way then-premier Jim Prentice had just shot himself in the foot in the 2015 provincial leaders’ debate (Photo: Screenshot).

Who needs this stuff? At that moment, about a minute into the proceedings, you could almost hear TV remotes across the nation clicking for something more meaningful and engaging. RuPaul’s Drag Race, maybe, the Weather Channel, or the Home Shopping Network.

Needless to say, what Mr. Scheer was doing was not a debating technique. It was more akin, I would suggest, to punching your opponent at the start of a high school wrestling match while the referee was still explaining the rules and admonishing the adversaries to make a clean fight of it.

But the intention, obviously, was to introduce a faux riposte early in the debate that could be instantly clipped from the video, converted to an Internet meme, and posted along with a fatuous declaration of victory moments after the so-called debate had ended.

This is pretty much what the Conservatives did, of course. Unsurprisingly, according to Mr. Scheer’s Rebel Media trained campaign experts, he won the debate.

The effect, needless to say, will be that other parties will adopt the same strategy – out of necessity, knowing the Conservatives are bound to cheat the same way again. Whatever little utility these messy debates have will be further degraded.

But you can’t say there was nothing to be learned from this so-called debate. We all now know a shabby new rhetorical trick.

As for the actual debating, what little there was of it, I say NDP leader Jagmeet Singh won, and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May got the best lines.

For his part, Mr. Trudeau avoided setting anyone up to humiliate him, and thereby likely won the actual contest. Final judgment on that assessment will be available in a couple of weeks.

Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and Maxime Bernier of the People’s Party of Canada? I covered them in the third paragraph.

Disorder in the House!

The Alberta Legislature got back to business yesterday, and it’s nice to know that high on the agenda is a government motion to lend more decorum to the proceedings in the House.

I jest, of course.


Just try wearing this in the Alberta Legislature and see what happens (Photo: Amazon.com).

I am speaking of the motion brought forth by House Leader Jason Nixon resolving that the Legislature express its support for Alberta’s oil and gas industry (there will be no objections on that point in that assembly) by encouraging “individuals who show their support by wearing pro-Canadian oil and gas apparel, including when visiting the Alberta Legislature….”

Sad to say, this nonsense would almost certainly pass even if the Conservatives didn’t have a majority.

This was apparently cooked up by the brainiacs on Premier Jason Kenney’s strategic A-Team in response to the fact a visitor was asked to remove such a T-shirt before touring the Senate Chamber in Ottawa last month. This was acknowledged to be an error by the Parliamentary Protective Service, but it was blown into a massive brouhaha by a compliant media anyway.

Now Alberta Speaker Nathan Cooper will take it a step further by effectively allowing sartorial demonstrations in the public galleries — as long as they’re in favour of positions advocated by the government.

Needless to say, allowing gallery visitors to dress up in T-shirts supporting the government will lead to similar demonstrations against the government’s policies and actual protests with shouting and thrown objects when those demonstrators are instructed to remove their T-shirts or leave, with civil and criminal legal proceedings to follow. At best, this will be embarrassing.

Past speakers have insisted on proper decorum in the public galleries. Worn objects that might be construed as protests were pretty much restricted to cowboy boots and lapel pins, and the rules were applied the same way to all. Those days are gone.

Nothing to see here, people, move along please …


Peter Singh and friend (Photo: Facebook).

Also on the first day of the new sitting, the UCP moved to appoint Calgary-East MLA Peter Singh to membership on the Standing Committee on the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund.

Mr. Singh is under investigation by the Office of the Election Commissioner and the RCMP after allegations of bribery and fraud in a candidate nomination election last year. He denies the allegations.

The Heritage Fund contains assets of about $18 billion.

Mr. Nixon dismissed NDP Opposition concerns as “fear and smear politics.”

It is not for no good reason Liberals often called Mr. Scheer, “Harper with a smile”. His pleasant demeanor was his greatest political asset and helped win him the Conservative leadership. He seemed pleasant and innocous enough, that is until he threw that image away and tried to go for Trudeau’s jugular at the start of the only debate most Canadians will watch. He ended up sounding a bit like the most mean spirited and partisan of Harper’s attack dogs. Its probably not good for their political fortunes that the Conservatives inadvertently remind us of that at this moment.

Now, perhaps Mr. Trudeau had it coming and the nation probably wanted him to clearly receive the message that we have been disappointed with him. In any event, Trudeau took the shot fairly well. However, in putting out your best shot, there is an art of timing. The blow might have been more effective in a moment when Mr. Trudeau said something to over extend himself, rather than an unprovoked attack before he actually said anything.

However, it did set the tone for the entire debate which was bitter and nasty on all sides, with not much respect shown all around. Mr. Trudeau held back a bit initially, but later returned several shots to Scheer. I think the format could be better, too many peripheral participants, too many tangental responses and yes, way too much cross talk.

Sadly for Mr. Scheer, despite his new more assertive and aggressive approach, few thought he won the debate. He hit Trudeau as hard as he could, but there was no knock out. I hope at least the organizers have now figured how not to do a debate. Perhaps in several years someone will remember this sad attempt and do it better. It would be hard to do it much worse.

If are fathers and grandfathers were brave enough to dodge Nazi bullets to preserve the right to vote etc then surely to goodness current day Canadians should be able to slog through a debate. In fact, it should be made mandatory. Failing that, how about issuing a tax credit.

Or how about $50 Tim Hortons gift card courtesy of the Heritage Fund which apparently is now in the hands of a fiscal wheeler dealer named Singh (no relation to Jag).

Trudeau’s team surely talked about potential faux outrage from Sheer. When Trudeau ignored the froth at the sides of Sheer’s mouth it made you think of Andy’s hypocricy. I wonder how many other people made the connection. What you saw was a leader vs a Trumpaloony .

This debate got the reformatories what they want, a suppressed vote.

This debate got what the networks think is good TV, thud and blunder.

The debate was a gong show no one really won, Singh looked okay, Trudeau probably was the closest to a winner for not losing it on Scheer. May unfortunately doesn’t show well in these types of things. Maxime was there so that’s a win for him the BQ guy is certainly no Duceppe. Scheer appeared like Harper with less personality what you would expect from an insurance broker or salesman, or maybe just guy that worked in the office who knows. What the debate did show, in my opinion, is we really lack leadership in this country. Given the format would an intelligent articulate leader even be able to shine though?

Scheer’s foreign policy is a mishmash of the Cold War, the British Empire and Bible stories, so changing the subject was a smart move.

Perhaps Jagmeet and Elizabeth took the podium because they were the only 2 there, including moderators, who had something to say about actual circumstances.

“But the intention, obviously was to introduce a faux riposte early in the debate that could be instantly clipped from the video, converted to an Internet meme, and posted along with a fatuous declaration of victory moments after the so-called debate had ended.”

Mr. Scheer invoked Trumpian methods by hurling personal insults into his attack on Mr. Trudeau. But why did he stop with simple schoolyard name calling like “phoney” and “fraud?” If he really wanted to go full Donald, he could have included really good stuff for his red meat base like “dumb as a rock”, “wacky and deranged” and one of Trump’s favourites, “slime ball.”

Come on, Andrew, you could have done much better.

It’s curious how many debate-watchers complained of leaders “talking over each other”. I dunno—is it because I’m from BC that my own take was the opposite? After all, we here in the Panhandle-stopper province have seen our own leaders’ debate start, proceed and end with incessant, unintelligible bickering many, many times.

The six-way, multiple-moderator format was different and interesting, as far as these debates go. I thought the number of laughs and moments of collegial camaraderie was remarkable; they all happened during bumps in the complicated debating procedure.

Not only that: I can’t recall ever seeing so many leaders acknowledge in a semi-congratulatory way other leaders’ platforms. Some were charmingly backhanded: Blanchet approved of JT’s SNC-Lavelin move but allowed that he just did it the wrong way; May prayed aloud to the PM that he win only a minority; and everybody paid homage to Jagmeet Singh’s firsthand, personally-targeted experience with racism. Thus the hypocrisy of the two right-wing parties whose leaders associate with rampant anti-immigrant bigots was illustratively exposed (Scheer’s acknowledgement to Singh was as long as a penitential confession after which he may sin again; Bernier’s very presence inspired Singh’s only bitter remark—that the xenophobe shouldn’t even be on the stage).

The best line was Singh’s quip after a few of the moderators confused his and Scheer’s names: “I wore an orange turban special for tonight—what does it take [to look different than Scheer]?” I laughed, anyway.

I really don’t want the ScheerCons to become government so was glad Bernier’s performance was fairly solid and should attract some of the bigots in the Con party who probably voted for him to be leader. Right-wing voters are more likely tactical-voting’s strategic target, not practitioners themselves, so it could be some of them don’t really get vote-splitting and will split the neo-right by voting their first preference as a result. The more Bernier erodes ScheerCon support, the more I like it.

Scheer’s opening odium might have been staged for subsequent campaign propaganda, but it sank him for the rest of the debate: so mean-spirited and predictable—exactly what his base wants—the one Scheer has to protect from Bernier’s pilfering. I remain convinced most Canadians will be turned off by Scheer’s ostentatious, hypocritical negativity and ad hominem against JT. He could do worse and whip out a niqab to blunt Bernier’s simpler anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Here on the Big Island, we know all about vote-splitting; here it’s the Conservatives who benefit by vote-splitting between Greens and Dippers. The big difference between Green-Dipper splits and ScheerCon-People’s Party splits is that we have a lot more experience out here. In the last federal and provincial elections, Green vote-counts were conspicuously lower than the party had polled prior to either election, meaning many Greens do understand how vote-splitting works and are willing to vote tactically for the NDP to prevent the most environmentally unfriendly party from winning candidates or government.

It was educative to watch Elizabeth May break a cardinal rule as she continues to pull out all the stops in her final, do-or-die election: once again she deigned to presume a minority government and a supremely influential balance-of-power position for her party, and hers alone. But that’s a no-no which, nevertheless, she seems to have calculated to be an acceptable risk in the desperate circumstance—the risk of eroding Green volunteers’ morale, of inciting complacency or riling resentments from soft supporters, the foolhardiness perfectly matching another, equally risky presumption: that she’ll be okay working with a ScheerCon minority (perhaps she regrets making that statement early on—she seemed to prefer a Liberal minority during the debate—she poignantly told Scheer he will never be Prime minister— again risking volunteer and supporter loyalty by uttering such baseless prognostications). Memo to Ms May: voters will decide what the result will be and it’s always bad form for a leader to insinuate a coalition or speculate on a balance-of-power situation before voters have spoken.

As a Big Island Dipper I take exception to May’s misleading rhetoric that it’s time for all Green-minded voters to vote their preference, “without fear”—the kind of fear that pro-reppers like her characterize FPtP tactical-voting as being systemically forced upon the electorate, an evil and undemocratic vote against, rather than for, a party or candidate. Memo to voters: in almost all ridings a Green vote will not elect a Green candidate, and in many ridings, especially on Van Isle and the West Coast Mainland where Liberals don’t much figure, a Green vote will ensure the Conservative candidate wins. In the latter case, Greens would further their professed environmental ethos by voting tactically for the candidate most likely to beat the Con candidate. That’s especially true on the Big Island where Greens have been emboldened by relatively high polling numbers—the highest in Canada—yet not high enough in most of these ridings to elect a Green unless every single traditional NDP voter switches parties. Considering the NDP holds second or first place in most Van Isle ridings, that kind of conversion seems most unlikely. May has toned down her more overt electoral-reform sour-grapes rhetoric but keeps alluding to it by telling voters to ignore the fact that we still have FPtP and ignore the fact that tactical-voting is therefore a legitimate consideration for every voter to make, not the devil incarnate that pro-reppers campaign on during electoral reform debates and referenda.

All in all I found the debate informative and probably helpful: it will probably increase vote-splitting between Scheer’s and Bernier’s parties in favour of neither, and decrease vote-splitting between Greens and Dippers which would otherwise only favour the ScheerCons. Well done!

PS: my kid brother and I agreed by text that if we had our druthers after watching the debate we’d both vote for Althea Raj.
He said he was glad when it was over. But he’s a “Buck-a-Beer” guy—perhaps now regretfully so—and I naturally have more to say about almost anything political. Ms Raj is, of course, the Huff Post’s political analyst.

“We trust that Ms. Thunberg will recognize Alberta’s leading human rights and environmental standards,” said Premier Jason Kenney’s spokesperson, Christine Myatt, in a statement yesterday. “Especially in comparison to oil-producing dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela – which she will presumably visit next …” (Emphasis added.)


Kenney Government spokesperson Christine Myatt (Photo: Linked-in).

Ms. Myatt also suggested Ms. Thunberg should visit “major growing emitters like China.”

Such a strategy doesn’t give the impression grownups are in charge here in Alberta, and appears to ape U.S. President Donald Trump’s similarly sarcastic response to Ms. Thunberg’s grim speech on climate change to the United Nations Climate Action Summit last month.

“She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” President Trump tweeted. “So nice to see!”

Still, it’s not as bad as a complete hysterical meltdown. I suppose we Albertans should count our blessings.


Kenney Government chief tweeter Matt Wolf (Photo: Linked-in).

Ms. Myatt’s one-liner was echoed, unsurprisingly, by Matt Wolf, the $200,000-per-year Kenney Court Tweeter, between tweets insulting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Rockefeller Family, presumably intended to shore up the government’s taxpayer-supported federal election campaign and its alternative reality conspiracy theories.

Even Energy Minister Sonya Savage, said to be one of the adults in Premier Kenney’s inner circle, weighed in with a similar if milder line, tweeting that Ms. Thunberg should “learn how Albertans are proud to produce energy the world needs with the highest environmental, social, and governance standards. Then she should visit other energy producing countries …”

For her part, Ms. Thunberg has not indicated when she will arrive here, or by what mode of transportation, although one imagines she is enjoying the furor she is already provoking in Alberta’s say-ethical-not-fungible oil circles. Neither has she yet responded to the Kenney government’s sarcastic cheap shots.


Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Presumably when she does, she will remind the UCP’s supporters that even if China can be persuaded to buy and burn bitumen from Alberta, that will nevertheless result in more carbon in the atmosphere for which both Canada and China will share responsibility.

As for the Kenney Government’s commentary about Canada’s genuinely admirable commitment to protecting human rights, it is in significant part the result of our 1982 Constitution, which impacts Canada’s political reality today largely because of the commitment during that decade of prime minister Pierre Trudeau and his Liberal Government.

Moreover, we should remember that the Constitution’s Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in particular was unpopular with many hard-core Conservatives in the 1980s. In fairness, Charter opponents included some non-conservatives, and Progressive Conservative premiers Bill Davis of Ontario and Richard Hatfield of New Brunswick supported the prime minister.

Opponents argued, quite rightly, that the Charter undermined the supremacy of Parliament. And a good thing that was too!

In addition, it is worth remembering that in 1998, Mr. Kenney demanded Premier Ralph Klein use the Charter’s Notwithstanding Clause to overturn a Supreme Court of Canada ruling making it illegal to fire employees on the grounds of their sexual orientation.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

And in 2001, Stephen Harper, who would later become Conservative prime minister and after that the UCP Government’s eminence grise, helped draft the notorious Firewall Manifesto urging Mr. Klein to weaken Alberta’s ties to Confederation.

While the Firewall letter, signed by a group of right-wing activists associated with the University of Calgary, called for Alberta to take such measures as replacing the RCMP with an easier-to-control provincial police force, dumping the Canada Pension Plan, and creating a U.S.-style private health care system, it was undoubtedly inspired by hostility to the elder Mr. Trudeau’s successful constitutional project.

To Mr. Klein’s great credit, he ignored both Mr. Kenney’s and Mr. Harper’s suggestions, placing them in the constitutional trash bucket, where they belonged.

So when Conservatives like Mr. Kenney and Ms. Savage harp on Canada’s enviable human rights record to visiting activists like Ms. Thunberg, we need to keep in mind that many of them have opposed it every step of the way.

Moreover, when they sarcastically advise Ms. Thunberg to visit autocratic petro-states like Russia, and theocratic petro-states like Saudi Arabia and Iran, these places are very much the model for some of the Alberta separatists they have been encouraging, not to mention those oil billionaires who apparently think holding environmental convictions is the equivalent of treason and ought to be punished accordingly.

What does “Canada’s enviable human rights record” have to do with AB’s deplorable greenhouse gas emissions record?
Does planet Earth respond differently to our “ethical” emissions? Does Mother Earth grant Canadians a reprieve from global warming? Are we spared from wildfires, lethal heat waves, drought, wildfire, floods, sea level rise, coastal erosion, warming oceans, melting sea ice, etc.?

Meanwhile, the NDP responds with empty praise for its own “nation-leading” climate plan with fictional emissions reductions and its support for working people producing “responsible” oil and gas.

What is “responsible” oil and gas? How does it differ from “ethical” oil and gas? Does planet Earth respond differently to “responsible” emissions? Isn’t it the same black tar goop that we are digging up and shipping to China? Isn’t pollution still endangering the health of indigenous people in the region? Aren’t caribou still being extirpated? Aren’t wolves still being shot and poisoned? Don’t most of the profits of this hellish enterprise still flow out of the country to foreign investors?

The NDP’s response is just as denialist and condescending than the UCP’s. In fact, it’s worse, because we no longer have industry critics in the Legislature. No one heeding the science. Notley & Co. took the progressive, science-based option off the table. Albertans now have to choose between bad and worse.

Remember when Mark Carney was the Governor of the Bank of Canada? He kept chirping at the Canadian corporations who were not trickling down their wealth with investments, employment, new business, etc. They were sitting on years and years, courtesy of too low corporate tax rates by both the Lierals and the Conservatives,, of some $600 billion.
I wonder if the Kenney UCP, et al, be just as snotty toward Mark Carney as they are toward Greta Thunberg. One would think, that if money really talks, they would be listening to both.

Alberta has the “highest environmental, social, and governance standards” according to Ms. Savage. I call BS. Effective impunity of the fossil energy gang to take private land does not speak to high governance standards. Leaving an unfunded multi-billion dollar clean up liability does not speak to any kind of environmental standards nor does ignoring the high cancer rates among down-stream first nations people. The thuggish reaction of the fossil energy people to even the mildest of criticisms says all you need to know about the social standards in Alberta. The fact Kenney has funded a star tribunal witch hunt into critics of the fossil energy sector speaks for itself.

The failed Notley administration and the Kenney administration just demonstrate how the Government of Alberta has been captured by the fossil energy crowd, just as Dr. Taft, among many others, contended.

It was the Alberta PCs, starting with Ralph Klein, who allowed oil companies in Alberta to get away with not cleaning up their messes, leaving Albertans with a $260 billion bill to cleanup abandoned oil wells in Alberta. How is Jason Kenney and the UCP dealing with this? They are not. They are ignoring it, like they do will all the other unsurpassed Conservative scandals.

The NDP did zero to change the total industry capture of the Government of Alberta. The NDP also failed to explain why the glory days of the Klein administration are gone forever. This paved the way for Kenney and the UCP to peddle false hope and cast blame where it is not deserved.

And just for fun, here’s a quote from a news story in Monday’s Guardian: 

“. . . energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles.

In the UK, renewable energy projects generated more electricity over the last quarter than fossil fuels for the first time since the country’s first public power plant fired up in 1882. It is a marked change from only 10 years ago, when gas and coal generated more than 70% of the UK’s electricity.”

I think you are probably correct, the UCP and/or their war room is going to step in it big time. Conservatives like to attack others they don’t agree with and they have had some political success, at least in Alberta and in a few other places in western Canada in demonizing environmentalists. Their message is very simple and is designed to appeal to those people concerned about their jobs or the energy based regional economy – those environmentalists will take away your jobs. I think even in Alberta their is a growing concern about environment and climate change, but when pitted against an immediate concern of getting a pay cheque next month and paying your bills, its not hard to figure out which concern triumphs. The Green Party and others have made reassuring, but unfortunately vague and not completely credible proposals about replacing jobs in the energy sector with green jobs, but the need to be much more concrete about this if they are to convince many Albertans.

However, the Conservatives have their own bigger weaknesses. It is hard to defend oil that has a higher carbon footprint these days and bringing up Saudi Arabia or whoever just misses the point when the issue is carbon emissions. So in response to the Greta threat, the Alberta UCP so far appears to be both condescending and clueless. That sort of message may play ok in Fort McMurray, where perhaps people don’t want to think too much about carbon emissions, but will not play well in the larger Canadian, or if Greta comes here, international stage. The Alberta government and its war room will be shown to be hopelessly out of step with the rest of the world.

There is an old saying that generals have a tendency to try fight the last war over again and in this case our general Kenney seems determined to prove that to be true. The sort of misinformation and half truths that might have worked somewhat better ten or fifteen years ago will no longer work in an era of heightened concern about climate and carbon emissions. As for your half baked theories about conspiracies, Mr. Kenney, the rest of the world will just laugh at you and by extension probably laugh at Alberta for electing such a twit, so it would be best to shut about them when Greta comes here.

The irony of course is the similarity between Kenney and Extinction Rebellion. Both funded by oil money in the case of extinction rebellion old oil money. Both groups seem to want authoritarian control to punish those that question them. And both want access, in Kenney’s case already have, to taxpayer money for their cause.
Seeming to play right into Kenney’s rhetoric who thought it would be a good idea to bring in a foreign foundation funded speaker to bash the tar sands? This just gives ammunition to Kenney and his ilk and it is hard to argue against because the facts are right out in the open. Probably should have given this a little thought, yet another failure of the environmental movement. Real urgent environmental issues will be ignored as a result of this decision, thanks for nothing. As an added bonus we have to tolerate the endless references to Suzuki’s daughters 1992 speech. Again hard to argue against given the facts being right in our faces again.
It is almost like these professional environmentalists don’t want to solve anything just continue protesting and drawing a salary.

Yeah, and fascist right-wingers are luxuriating in oil money to deny science that proves they are killing 100% of the world’s children by destroying their habitat.

Which of the two is real child abuse? One is fictitious abuse while the other outright genocide.

Sure hope none of the nay-sayers are driving in cars (or buses, trains, airplanes or boats)…cause if you are, you’re part of the problem. Using fossil fuels and then complaining that they aren’t produced clean enough for you to use is contradictory.

If there was no demand, there would be no production.

59,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Those elusive Liberals of Edmonton Strathcona: Where did Mainstreet’s pollsters find them,2019-10-15 01:31:00,David Climenhaga,,"Volunteers for NDP candidate Heather McPherson’s campaign in the federal Edmonton-Strathcona riding are asking themselves, where the heck are those mobs of Liberal voters one pollster claims to have identified in the riding?

Door-knocking in 2019 in the progressive-leaning riding on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River feels much the same as it did in 2015, when New Democrat Linda Duncan went on to win by a comfortable 7,051-vote margin, NDP volunteers in the riding insist.

Things have changed in the past four years, of course. For one thing, Ms. Duncan is about to retire. But the Dipper doorknockers maintain they’re getting about the same number of positive responses as they have in recent elections. There are few Liberal signs on private property.

So where are the hordes Liberals the riding-specific poll by Toronto-based Mainstreet Research claims to have unearthed in September?

The first political activists in the riding heard of it was in a detail-deficient iPolitics story published on Sept. 23.

Absent other information, the results showed up as a big jump for the Liberals in the 388Canada.com poll tracker on Sept. 25 and 26 — a development that if real could result in a split vote that favours Conservative Sam Lilly in what may be the only riding in the province with the potential to elect an Opposition member this year.


Liberal candidate Eleanor Olszewski (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The Liberals, understandably, jumped on it and pushed the poll’s results hard in their efforts to boost their candidate, Eleanor Olszewski.

New Democrats believe it’s a false narrative, but fear that if too many voters were persuaded by it, it could get Mr. Lilly elected.

A Star Edmonton story mentioned it — again with very few facts — on Oct. 1. (The traditionally Liberal-leaning Star acquired iPolitics a year ago.)

On Saturday, Postmedia’s Alberta newspapers, which nowadays campaign openly for the Conservatives, claimed in a riding profile presumably based on Mainstreet’s poll, which was not acknowledged, that the NDP and Liberals are polling “neck and neck” in the riding and suggested Mr. Lilly would win.

So does the Mainstreet poll indicate a real trend, or is it an outlier for whatever reasons?

To answer this important question, it would be helpful to get more information about the poll’s methodology and the wording of the questions it asked. Strangely, though, that information does not show up in any of the credulous mainstream media accounts seen so far. I asked Mainstreet President and CEO Quito Maggi for that information.


Conservative candidate Sam Lilly (Photo: Facebook).

His emailed response was not particularly informative, unfortunately. “The poll was conducted for and published by iPolitics, it’s behind their paywall for subscribers,” he responded. “I can’t provide further details beyond confirming that it exists and that the quote (in the Oct. 1 Star story) is an accurate reflection of the poll findings at the time.”

For more information, he suggested subscribing to iPolitics.

Well, sorry, but AlbertaPolitics.ca’s subscription budget is all tapped out. So we’ll just go with what we know about past Mainstreet polls, which are sometimes accurate, sometimes not so accurate, and now and then, in Mr. Maggi’s own words, “a catastrophic failure.”

The best example of the latter category was the 2017 Mainstreet prediction Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi would lose to his Conservative challenger by a wide margin. Mr. Nenshi won. That was the poll Mr. Maggi termed catastrophic.


Mainstreet Research President and CEO Quito Maggi (Photo: Twitter).

Then there was the riding poll just before the Nanaimo, B.C., by-election in January in which the pollster said the B.C. Liberals had a huge lead over the NDP candidate (who won) and Mainstreet’s much-reported forecast of a Green Party victory in the Prince Edward Island provincial election in April (which the Conservatives won).

Mainstreet also got the winners right but the margins wrong enough to be outside its margin of error in this year’s provincial elections in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec. Other Mainstreet polls have done better.

Still, this suggests at the very least that both the Star and Postmedia need to give their readers more information about the polls they report on.

Mainstreet’s history notwithstanding, I’d bet money all three major parties’ campaigns have a good grip on what’s really happening on the ground now in Edmonton Strathcona — and that it’s not quite what Mainstreet said last month.

I’ve heard suggestions the Liberals are playing a long game — get a weak Conservative candidate elected and then beat him with a star candidate in four years. Maybe, but I don’t think that’s the way political parties usually think, especially in an election this close. True or not, though, if the NDP loses narrowly and the Liberals get blamed, they may not be forgiven for it in the riding by the time the next federal election rolls around.

Or maybe progressive voters in Strathcona will blame one of the Green, Communist, Marxist-Leninist or People’s Party candidates. Who knows?

My bet is the NDP are in fact a hair ahead of the other parties right now. After all, the Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion shows the riding leaning NDP, and despite being impacted by the Mainstreet poll bump, the 388Canada.com poll aggregation site, updated on Oct. 14, calls it a tossup with the Conservatives narrowly ahead. In other words, it’s the NDP and the Conservatives who are neck and neck.

Regardless, if you’re a New Democrat and you live in Edmonton Strathcona, or for that matter just someone opposed to the Conservatives, you’d better get out there and make sure on election day that Ms. McPherson is far enough ahead to win","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

I too have suspicions about some of the public riding level polls that show fairly even splits between the NDP and the Liberals, in certain ridings previously won both by the NDP and the Liberals in Edmonton.

Maybe the pollsters did not ask the right questions or perhaps the questions they asked were designed to get the answers they wanted. In any case, I find it hard to believe the Conservatives are well ahead in Edmonton Strathcona or Edmonton Center and I also suspect Edmonton Millwoods is much closer than the public polling shows. I have seen a few more Conservative signs in Strathcona and actually also a few more NDP signs than in 2015. I suspect it will be a much closer race this time, but I don’t have the sense the Conservatives are ahead by a lot, if at all.

Perhaps the coalitions of progressive voters in Strathcona and Edmonton Center have finally disintegrated, but I have a feeling the majority of voters in both areas still really do not want another Conservative backbencher and will again vote again for the party and candidate in their area best positioned to keep that from happening.

Perhaps they are similar to most Liberal candidates in Alberta, brought in from somewhere else but never really make an appearance in the riding. The real problem is, in my opinion, the vast majority of voters are not aware of Mainstreet’s history of using polls to shall we say nudge elections in a certain way.
Hopefully this will rally the voters in Strathcona so Alberta at least has one voice at the table, the way things look we are headed for a minority government. The choice is pretty clear a backbencher who will tow the party line or someone that may have some say.

…AND NOW THIS: Reader beware when it comes to online polling results.

Unscientific online polls start with a badly selected sample. It’s not a sample of anybody; it is people who have volunteered/signed up to take online “internet” polls for incentives like prizes or money.

Respondents for online polls are not randomly selected because there is no complete list of voters’ IP internet addresses; therefore the poll is not probability-based and has no margin of error. Furthermore, there is no way such polls can take into account the views of non-internet users. Statistical margins of error are not applicable to online non-probability polls. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error and measurement error.

“if the NDP loses narrowly and the Liberals get blamed… Or maybe progressive voters in Strathcona will blame one of the Green, Communist, Marxist-Leninist or People’s Party candidates.”

Or blame Rachel Notley, who refused to publicly support the federal NDP in her riding of Edmonton Strathcona. Over one issue: pipelines.

If pipelines are the deciding issue, Notley’s only choice is between Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives or Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party.
Hilariously, some diehard Notley loyalists nominate the Pipeline Princess for federal NDP leader after Singh. As if the federal party would lay out a welcome mat for Notley, after she sabotaged the federal NDP campaign and candidate Heather McPherson in Edmonton Strathcona,.
When will AB NDP supporters wake up?

And speaking of Mainstreet Research, if the Toronto polling company had called it right, Bill Smith would be celebrating his second anniversary as mayor of Calgary today.

He is not. Mayor Naheed Nenshi is still on the job and, one can have no doubt, enjoying the occasion immensely.

Abortion services become more theoretical than actual for many Alberta women

Access to abortion services in Alberta is becoming more theoretical than actual for many women outside Edmonton and Calgary, a new report from the Parkland Institute published yesterday concludes.

In Political Challenges and Digital Frontiers: Reproductive Health and Services in Southern Alberta, authors Carol Williams, Katelyn Mitchell, and Carly Giles argue that with only three abortion providers in Alberta — and none outside of the two major cities — “abortion travel” and its associated costs have become “a necessity for many who have made the decision to terminate a pregnancy.”

Crisis pregnancy centres, which claim neutrality but downplay or misrepresent abortion as an option, outnumber abortion providers in Alberta by almost seven to one, the report indicates. “These organizations have politicized pregnancy to such an extreme that youth seeking unbiased counselling on issues of intimacy or reproduction may fear to do so.”","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

There are actually decent folks who are not in politics for themselves, but for the good of everyone. I have often thought Mr. Kalmanovitch is one of the good ones and for me this confirms it. If current polls are any indication, this could be a very close election both nationally and in a number of ridings, including Edmonton Strathcona.

So, I did a quick search of the College of Physicians website, and there is at least one OB/Gyn in northwestern Alberta who does “pregnancy terminations” … This physician has practice privileges in the AHS regional hospital in the community.

So, the service is not as inaccessible outside the two major cities as this post would lead one to believe … But, maybe the Parkland Institute authors weren’t as adept at searching CPSA’s website as I am lol …

55,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,"Edmonton Strathcona voters should vote for NDP’s Heather McPherson, says former Alberta leader Brian Mason",2019-10-18 01:36:00,David Climenhaga,,"No name was mentioned, but it was pretty clear exactly whom former Alberta New Democratic Party Leader Brian Mason had in mind Wednesday when he posted a social media comment stating he will be voting for the federal NDP candidate in his own riding on Monday.

In case that message wasn’t clear enough, a relaxed and rather shaggy looking Mr. Mason had made a point of posing in a photo with Heather McPherson, the NDP candidate in the race to represent the Edmonton Strathcona riding.

That, of course, is the riding where Opposition Leader Rachel Notley lives and votes. And Ms. McPherson was the candidate Ms. Notley implied she might decide not to vote for because of the former premier’s differences with federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh over Alberta’s perceived need for more pipelines to tidewater.

“When we get closer to the election, I’ll make a decision in my own riding about which candidate’s best able to represent the needs of Albertans and the people in my riding of Edmonton-Strathcona,” Ms. Notley said on Oct. 4.


Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Mr. Mason, who served as minister of infrastructure and transportation in Ms. Notley’s cabinet, is not of the same mind. “I’m voting for the NDP in this election,” he stated in his Facebook commentary.

“I never thought I’d have to make that statement, but given some of the differences over pipeline policy between our party (and recent government) and the federal NDP, some people are asking,” he continued.


Former Alberta NDP leader Ray Martin, who served in that role from 1985 to 1993 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Noting that he had been a strong advocate of expanding the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, Mr. Mason nevertheless stated: “But this federal election is about a lot more than pipelines. It’s also about protecting public services, strengthening public health care, childcare and creating good jobs. It’s about building an economy that works for everyone, not just the 1%.”

“Edmonton Strathcona, a seat the NDP currently holds, may well be the only riding standing between Andrew Scheer and an Alberta sweep. Right now, it’s neck and neck, with the Liberals fading fast,” he said.


Jack Layton, leader of the federal NDP from 2003 to his death in August 2011 (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“Confusion about whether Alberta New Democrats should vote for another party or not vote at all merely serves to ensure that Scheer (and his sidekick Jason Kenney) get another Alberta seat,” Mr. Mason stated.

And, yeah, from time to time during the decade from 2004 to 2014 when Mr. Mason was Alberta NDP leader, he had disagreements about the oil sands with Jack Layton, then the federal leader. “But we were able to discuss our differences and to appreciate the different political pressures each of us faced,” he explained.

“We need that kind of dialog again,” he said, pointedly, concluding: “But right now, we have to keep our Alberta voice in the Canadian Parliament, and send Heather McPherson to Ottawa.”

In other words, Ms. Notley can do what she thinks best, but Mr. Mason will be voting for the NDP, and if you live Edmonton Strathcona, he thinks you should too.

54,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Massive Edmonton rally greets eco-activist Greta Thunberg; tiny truck counter-protest ignored by all but media,2019-10-19 02:26:00,David Climenhaga,,"It would have been a remarkable accomplishment for any group to summon a throng the size of the multitude that enthusiastically greeted 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg in Edmonton yesterday afternoon.

To do it on three days’ notice in the capital city of Canada’s fossil fuel heartland where everyone supposedly holds the same rosy view of pipelines and petroleum extraction is not only a tribute to the incredible organizing skills of the young people who run Edmonton Climate Justice, but a barometer of the true level of concern about global warming in this province, country and world.


Ms. Thunberg, with some of her young supporters, on Jasper Avenue (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Especially with a federal election hours away, Alberta’s United Conservative Party and the federal party it supports arguably should take note of the potential long-term impact of denying climate change and stalling efforts to reduce its impact. Yesterday, however, the UCP mostly took a powder.

That included Premier Jason Kenney who seized the opportunity to re-announce a natural gas pipeline 70 kilometres out of town.

In addition to widespread concern about the environment, part of the explanation for the huge mid-day crowd was doubtless the star power exerted by Ms. Thunberg, who came here despite the threats of a group of Yellow Vesty truckers to disrupt the march and climate strike.


Ms. Thunberg addresses a crowd estimated at 10,000 people at the Alberta Legislature (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

In the event, the counter-protesters’ threats were almost a total bust. Ms. Thunberg walked unhindered by cranky truckers, who were kept at a distance by police, six blocks through the streets of downtown. She was accompanied by about half the protesters who gathered at the Legislature, her small figure shielded by a retinue of young marchers.

When the march flowed into the Legislature’s plaza like a river of humanity, a massive crowd was already waiting.

Needless to say, the size of the crowd was soon controversial, with some of the usual suspects on the right questioning the organizers’ estimate 10,000 people filled the plaza in front of the Alberta Legislature. Some cited a police estimate of about 4,000, which would be close to the number of people who took part in the march from Beaver Hills House Park on Jasper Avenue.

Regardless of those opinions, the general rule of thumb among veteran Alberta protest organizers dating back to the days of mass demonstrations against Premier Ralph Klein’s effort to privatize health care is that it takes about 10,000 people to fill the plaza. Yesterday, the throng with Ms. Thunberg filled the plaza and overflowed into the square in front of the Federal Building. My personal estimate is that the crowd was closer to 12,000.


Part of the crowd flows into the Legislature’s plaza from the area of the Federal Building to the north (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Ms. Thunberg kept her remarks to about 10 minutes, and emphasized the gravity of the threat that faces the planet, not the specifics of the Alberta’s oilsands or its fossil fuel extraction industry.

“Today, it’s Friday, and as always we are on climate strike, young people all around the globe are again sacrificing their education to bring attention to the climate and ecological emergency,” she told the crowd. “We are not doing this because we want to, we aren’t doing it because it’s fun, we aren’t doing it because we have a special interest in the climate, or because we want to become politicians when we grow up.


The throng in the Plaza before Ms. Thunberg spoke (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

“We are doing this because our future is at stake. We are doing this because in this crisis we will not be bystanders. And we are doing it because we want the people in power to unite behind the science.”

“We teenagers are not scientists, nor are we politicians, but it seems many of us, apart from most others, understand the science, because we have done our homework,” she continued. “If people really knew about the full consequences of the climate and ecological emergency, then they would join us in the streets.”

“And if you think we should be in school instead, then we suggest you take our place in the streets, or better yet, join us, so we can speed up the process,” she said to loud cheers from the crowd.

As for the counter-protesting truckers, they came in about 30 vehicles, mostly pickup trucks, honked their horns and revved their engines while passersby ignored them.

If there were two people in each truck, no certainty, they were outnumbered by climate protesters approximately 200 to one. And, anyway, their protest was no different from a normal driving day in Edmonton when the truck-nuts crowd comes to town.

Despite mainstream media’s efforts to make it seem as if the protests were roughly equivalent, and its strange shyness about estimating the size of the crowd at the Legislature, the truckers would have done better to save diesel fuel by staying home in Red Deer.

Rachel Notley endorses Heather McPherson in Edmonton Strathcona

Better late than never, Opposition Leader Rachel Notley has endorsed Heather McPherson, the NDP candidate in the federal Edmonton Strathcona in which she lives.

“With the emerging possibility of a federal government led by Conservative Andrew Scheer and supported by the separatist Bloc, I am deeply concerned for the future of our country,” the former NDP premier wrote in a social media post published yesterday, walking back an earlier comment that she hadn’t decided whom to vote for because of her disagreements about pipeline policy with federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

“Mr. Scheer’s plans with respect to rolling back action on climate change, making massive cuts to federal spending that would hurt Canadian families, and tolerating divisive anti-choice, homophobic and xenophobic views within his party, are deeply troubling,” she wrote. In the face of that, it has become increasingly clear, she said, that only one candidate can defeat the Conservative in the riding, and that is Ms. McPherson.

“I know Heather McPherson to be an articulate woman of integrity, intelligence, determination and competence. I know she understands the importance of the energy industry to Albertans. I know she will stand up in Parliament, and in her caucus, to ensure Alberta’s perspective is heard — not just by those who agree with us but also by those who do not.

“Last Monday I voted for Heather McPherson. This Monday I urge voters in Edmonton Strathcona to do the same.”

Mr. Notley was killed in a commercial plane crash while flying from Edmonton to Peace River to spend the weekend in his Spirit River-Fairview constituency.

Thunberg has such a clear voice and such a clean delivery of her lines, it really is quite remarkable. She seems to inherently know not to go on like a dull bore, but make her points short, sharp and direct, leaving supporters aching for just a bit more. That’s clever. And effective.

Makes our two main “leaders” in this bloody awful election campaign seem like stumblebums. The only time Scheer sounds strong is when he’s lying as he did yesterday claiming the Liberal-NDP coalition, which doesn’t even exist, would raise GST. For which baseless assertion he got called out by a CBC reporter as pulling numbers out of thin air, and even CTV and Global didn’t feature him in a great light. There’s your main dope of the moment who needs to pay heed to Thunberg, and get a lesson in how to tell the truth at the same time — apparently, he is congenitally unable to do so. An obstinate dullard and social regressive who turns out to be a nasty angry piece of work. Kenney just put his hands over his ears and buggered off out of town — he’s the ultimate back room boy and hates direct confrontation, preferring to sleaze it out from a UCP bunker.

Trudeau declared a Climate Emergency a couple of months ago, and after metaphorically pasting that poster on a billboard for a whole day promptly forgot all about it, other than attempting to worm his way into Thunberg’s confidence in Montreal for a hoped-for spot of selfie indulgence. That was a bust, because she took no notice of his posturing. What swirling nonsense runs around in that man’s head I cannot comprehend. It’s all froth and no substance and a need to be loved, while the old guard running him goes on acting pretty much the same as always, influencing his scatterbrain to act like a neoliberal at home, and a neoconservative overseas, all in the aid of business.

I was glad to see so many attend the rally in the oil patch matching the Halifax turnout on Climate Strike day. And I’m also glad that Notley grudgingly managed to struggle with her soul and say she voted NDP in the advance poll. Singh turns out to be no flash in the pan — who’d have guessed that back in August? Certainly not many. And I love him sticking it to Quebecers, faux sophisticates at best, who justify nonsense by saying 70% of them believe in putting down wearing religious symbols for people in public service – the tyranny of the majority over the unable to be heard minority there has not gone unnoticed.

Personally, I got completely fed up with all the nonsense this time around, and voted in the advance poll myself for the first time ever. Apparently 4.7 million voters agreed. No matter how you slice it, having some party run Canada on about 30% voter support ain’t going to cut it. 70% of voters denied? If Scheer in particular, holder of such right wing views and willing to concoct lying nonsense on cue, tries to wrest control of the Commons when he doesn’t even know his Grade 10 Civics after being Speaker, he’ll engender backlash, I believe. In any case, no other party would support him on many matters, so he would be tossed in a non-confidence vote before he ever got started on his austerity nonsense. Ironically I think the Liberals would support him more often than the smaller parties because of that TM pipeline purchase. They’re both establishment. So where’s our proportional representation that was supposed to prevent crap like this? That’s Trudeau’s cross to bear for cancelling it, the dolt.

When are our two main parties going to reflect the broader public opinion on issues of import? Ever, never or what? All we got was Scheer bashing Trudeau, and vice versa with a helping of dissing Doug Fraud, and about zero policy on real matters. We were instead offered a few hundred bucks apiece as bribes from both of them. The Greens tanked, which was disappointing, given Thunberg’s following. I think we’ll be back on the hustings next Spring, and then there’ll be a ding dong battle.

Meanwhile, the real pressing problem of climate change has been essentially given a pass, despite Thunberg and young people. Talk about smoke and mirrors. It’s so easy for the moneyed influencers to change channels with the useless main street media they own breathlessly reporting on “leaders” bashing each other, rather than on issues. There was not a scrap of vision for the future offered by either Liberals or Conservatives. That’s the sorry state of Canada 2019.

Interesting article in the Edmonton Sun about Rachel Notley declaring she will vote NDP in the federal election. The article talks about how the former Premier still disagrees with Jagmeet Singh on the Transmountain expansion and will continue to challenge him on that issue. There are two interesting quotes from her that follow. “However, it is also my view that there is no parliamentary makeup that will allow Mr. Singh to assert those views.” Then she says “A minority government brings us the possibility of a national pharmacare program, a national dental-care program and at long last, real progress on establishing a national childcare program. These are important to me, and they are important to many Albertan’s.” So what amazes me after reading the two quotes is that on one hand she believes that a minority parliament won’t allow Jagmeet Singh to stop Transmountain but on the other a minority parliament will allow him to get a national pharmacare and a national daycare program. What amazingly fuzzy thinking from our former Premier!! Enjoy your day.

Captured by the oil industry to one side and the oily Consecutive Party to the other, Alberta isn’t just landlocked, we’re so far behind, we think we’re ahead.

Consider this piece in theTyee.can early this month, How Would Our Wartime Conservative Leaders Have Acted on the Climate Crisis? by Seth Klein. In the five years of Canada’s participation in WW-II, the nation of 11.5 million sent over a million soldiers to war, built 800,000 jeeps and trucks, 50,000 tanks, hundreds of warships and cargo ships, some 16,000 aircraft, supplied our soldiers and kept track of it all.

Jason Kenny mostly just grins like he’s planning to fight forest fires with tax cuts. Andrew Scheer is so brave, he is contending a national election armed with only a vacuum where coherent policy, honest answers, and I presume his soul should be.

Greta Thunberg is certainly making an impression upon environmental activism, starting in Northern Europe where such controversy as exists about climate-change is more about how fast to do something about it, and mobilizing her high school climate-strike straight to one of the beating hearts of the global petroleum octopus in Alberta where such controversy rather roils around whether climate-change exists at all, of whether it’s just the weather.

One of the first impressions I get from her remarkable sojourn is that her student supporters on the Great Plains can’t be branded as foreign-funded fifth-columnists so easily by tiresomely repetitious climate-change deniers—and that’s plainly great! To see those Albertan students, among whom “a retinue of young marchers” shielding “her small figure” from the impotent contingent of Albetarian Bitumanoids that droves of Thunberg’s well-wishers expected, is to admire marchers’ determination, instead of fanaticism, to work together around the world seriously, not merely celebrate stardom.

The spectacle is particularly heartwarming for me because it reminds of the Alberta I know and love— down to earth and get-down-to-business —where friendship and familiarity is easily found for anyone who goes there, but perhaps recently obscured by political polling in an icy climate of polarity over whether the polar regions are really melting —which might be the only impression everyone who’s never been to this great province gets, especially in this climate of political tumult and caricature.

Big thank you to organizers who supplied police protection for the yellow-vested truck-revvers intent on disrupting the protest else they get trampled by the “river of humanity” and massive crowd already waiting for the tiny climate-striker in-chief. Pray that the real disruption has been to the cultic intransigence of the petro-chauvinists to accelerate through their darkest, secret doubts and fears about the petro-industry and their jobs and throw brilliant daylight on realization that these determined, sunny faces present their futures, their very families getting down to the business of helping them with both science and love.

What heart, even the stoniest bitum-o-bumpkin bachelor’s, would want to separate from these wonderful students—our children and grandchildren? What petrified brain isn’t nagged by the amply demonstrated fact that, like Greta has so movingly articulated, we’ve left them no other choice but to strike for the climate just as surely as we have no other choice but to let them take helm. The time has come as surely as too much of the past has overstayed its welcome.

Belligerence failed to disrupt or provoke reaction in kind. Let the rest of Canada know this side of the Wild Rose province, too.

Thank you, all.

I came up from Calgary by bus for the rally and was amazed to see about 10,000 people gathered in front of the Legislature.
That was a story in itself! But the news media, in my opinion, really skewed the coverage. They tried to make it about conflict between pro- oil truckers and people who want to combat climate change. But as far as I could see the truckers had hardly any presence at the rally. The skewed coverage was duly noted by the people on the bus heading back to Calgary as further evidence that the Alberta media is completely cowed by the powers that be.

I arrived at the legislature grounds at 11 am. At that time with only a small crowd starting to gather the pro oil group appeared to number three hundred people and were a good percentage of the crowd. By 12:30 when the marchers arrived the crowd was overwhelmingly pro Greta. I’d add the estimate of 10,000 people supporting the rally is a conservative count.

Sad day indeed I remember the event, left to wonder what Notley could have accomplished. Also makes one remember the time when politicians were more civil he was on a very small plane with the PC MLA from a neighbouring riding.

The details have faded over time but wasn’t the final destination of the flight Peace River? The crash occurred while landing in High Prairie where Larry Shaben lived and was the PC MLA. I have seen the Grande Prairie reference in numerous places, perhaps because that is where the prisoner on the plane was being transferred? Maybe someone can correct my memory, did at one time have a copy the book Larry Shaben’s daughter wrote.

I just took another look at the book — which I read a couple of years ago from the public library, but don’t own — in Preview on Goodreads, and the flight in question was a milk run between Grande Prairie & Edmonton Municipal Airport, with stops at High Prairie & Fairview scheduled for the return leg, but only if there were passengers stopping there, which there were on that awful night. The crash happened at High Prairie.

Jim, your recollection is correct. I just checked Carol Shaben’s “Into the Abyss”, a book about the crash and its survivors. The first chapter is readable on-line at Ms Shaben’s website carolshaben.com. The flight was scheduled to go from Edmonton’s municipal airport to High Prairie and then on to Peace River. The crash occurred in heavy snow on the approach to High Prairie airport.

By coincidence I had been driving from Edmonton to Grande Prairie that Friday night. As a union rep I had stopped to meet with nurses at the hospitals in both Slave Lake and High Prairie on my route. When I left Slave Lake it was starting to snow. I was at the hospital in High Prairie for about an hour. When I came outside there was probably 20 centimetres of snow on my car. The drive to Grande Prairie was probably the worst of my life, but I did survive. I was able to attend Grant Notley’s funeral in Fairview the following week.

Whatever the number, it was an impressive turn out. I think the 4,000 was a very conservative estimate, but there is a conventional thinking in Alberta that almost all people are only interested in supporting the energy industry and I think many let that influence their reporting. Certainly that does not seem to be the case, particularly with the youth of Alberta. There is hope for the future. However, too bad Mr. Kenney was no where near to see for himself the actual size of the crowd. All those people will be voting in a few years – I think not a good sign for his long term political future. The big trucks made a bit of noise, but it seemed like the same few driving around and around in a circle. I actually thought the counter protest would have been bigger, this one actually seemed much smaller than the one the big truck rally they had several months ago to welcome or support Scheer. Maybe their heart is really not in protesting against our youth and fellow Albertans, as much as it was for protesting against Trudeau.

Greta is an excellent communicator, she keeps her message focused, short, to the point and avoids needless controversies. She even talked about that the environment should be a non partisan issue and she is absolutely correct. As I recall, at one time many conservatives actually supported a carbon tax as the best and most effective way to reduce emissions. Unfortunately, their current crop of so called leaders is not so visionary and has substituted total short term political expediency instead. Their hope is to obviously play to peoples fears about increasing energy prices, which is why the never seem to acknowledge the existence of rebates which will offset the carbon tax for most people (the money raised from the carbon tax will mostly be recycled – now, there is an environmentally friendly approach), but then most of their campaign has been based on lies, half truths and misleading people.

I often think of Mr. Kenney as the Don Quixote of our time, tilting against wind mills, fighting imaginary, but ultimately losing battles first against social progress as a leader of the social conservative side of the Conservative Party. Now, he has retreated to the strong hold of Conservatism to fight Canada and the world against climate change. Although he still looks powerful locally now, I suspect it will ultimately be another losing battle for him. I think history will not be kind to him or the other current reactionary Conservatives leaders with their desperate appeals to populism at a time when we really should be thinking about how to do more about the issue of climate change, not making excuses to less or nothing.

I am not surprised that the media did skew the coverage. I cancelled my subscription for the Herald because of the terrible coverage of labour and environmental issues. I think it is hard to underestimate the depths of influence that exists in the province. Even at the annual AUPE convention that I attended, there were boos when Greta’s name was mentioned. There is a big section of the members there that do support the oil industry and see any criticism as demonizing the oil workers. Clearly we still have a lot of work to do and I don’t think that the younger people will give up on this issue.

The almighty howl of fury Canadians would surely hear in such circumstances is what we get, I suppose, for not requiring students to attend high school civics classes to learn how our system of Parliamentary government works.


Conservative leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Flickr/Andrew Scheer).

It was deeply cynical and possibly quite dangerous for Mr. Scheer — who, as a former Speaker of the House certainly knows better — to claim that some kind of brand new Parliamentary convention requires the party that wins the most seats in a multi-party Parliament automatically to form the government.

Not only is there no such convention — that is, one of the unwritten rules our Parliamentary system inherited from the United Kingdom — there is one that says the opposite.

To wit: If the Prime Minister thinks after an election he can command the confidence of the House, the real parliamentary convention says he gets to try.


Former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Such a first minister’s effort may fail on an early vote of confidence, of course, as former Liberal New Brunswick premier Brian Gallant’s did last year. But it was only after that happened that Progressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs got to lead a government.

Mr. Higgs remains the premier, so I suppose New Brunswick Conservatives must feel the system works as intended.

But as Mr. Scheer well knows, that’s not the way things are likely to play out in Ottawa this time if a pizza Parliament with party representation thinly sliced is what we get tonight. This, presumably, is why the former insurance broker, or whatever he used to be, pulled this nonsense about a new parliamentary convention from his obviously fertile imagination and keeps repeating it as if repetition will make it true.

Nevertheless, you can also count on it that in such circumstances plenty of die-hard Conservatives here in Alberta would take Mr. Scheer at his word, or at least repeat his talking point, and say and do God knows what as a result.


The leader of the NDP in 2008, the late Jack Layton (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Of course, if the shoe is on the other foot, and Mr. Scheer manages to cobble together a deal with the separatist Bloc Québécois to form a government, all you’ll hear out here is the crickets. Or, actually, not even them, seeing as it’s getting too cold at night now for chirping.

But that’s just the way we roll out here in Wild Rose Country.

If you doubt me, recall that once upon a time, in a Canada not so different from the one we may be living in tonight, the Liberals and the NDP signed an agreement to form a coalition government, with a side deal with the Bloc Québécois not to pull the whole thing apart at the first opportunity.

The outrage in Conservative circles in Alberta reached near hysteria. But that was then and a Conservative government was threatened, not threatening.


Former Governor General Michaëlle Jean (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

The year was 2008, and I suspect those Conservatives knew that if the deal had come to fruition, Liberal Party leader Stéphane Dion might still be prime minister of Canada today.

As for Mr. Dion and Jack Layton, the NDP leader at the time, agreeing to sign a side deal with the Bloc, that was frequently described around here as treason.

Well, thanks to then prime minister Stephen Harper’s unconstitutional but never challenged agreement with governor general Michaëlle Jean to prorogue Parliament in defiance of convention, the Canadian people’s assembly was prevented from fulfilling its democratic role, to the great relief of Alberta’s Conservatives.

What happened since is well known and brings us to where we are today.

Indeed, if we face such circumstances tonight and we create a Venn diagram of Alberta Conservatives who viewed working with the Bloc in 2008 as outright treason and cutting a deal with them 11 years later a perfectly reasonable Parliamentary tactic, we will only need to draw one circle.

Why does Scheer repeat such easily refutable twaddle? Because he apparently needs to make sure his voting base hears it. Why is he so worried that they might not? Because there aren’t enough voters in that base to win a majority—and to lose even a minority would be nothing short of catastrophic, not only for Scheer, but for the whole, sorry excuse for a conservative party.

Yeah, he worried.

The self-righteous ScheerCons regularly accuse their rivals of hypocrisy; it’s yet another tRumpoid tactic adopted by the similarly flagging neo-right usurper and destroyer of a real Tory party: accuse your accusers of the same thing they accuse you of, no matter how blatantly obvious the ruse. It’s a sort of a dog-whistley virtue-signalling between the initiated—and they don’t care what noninitiates think about it: noninitiates are simply wrong and cannot possibly be right, much less righteous. Initiates in the circled wagon laager are, in a word, chauvinists.

I can’t wait for the caterwauling if the real parliamentary tradition has to be exercised. Conservatives will call it unethical, illegal, unconstitutional —but they’ve cried wolf so many times, so loudly, the nerve no longer transmits pain.

No doubt the real constitutional crisis Harper inflicted on Canada and parliamentary precedent will be immediately weaponized. Naturally neo-rightists will do it, too, no matter how hypocritical (see above).

But the big difference is: Scheer is not the Governor’s first minister from whom the Sovereign’s representative is duty bound to take advice. The Governor would only summon him if the Liberal government lost a confidence vote in the House first: and then Scheer’s minority would have to win the confidence vote on his very first bill. If he didn’t, the GG wouldn’t ask MPs if there’s another group of them who’ll commit to passing legislation—it’d be obvious by that point there is not, and she’d immediately call another election. Ouch. How would the ScheerCons weaponize that?

So, if Scheer wants to compound his boneheaded, self-serving rule-rewriting and kick the stilts out from under Harper’s hitherto forgotten episode (improper prorogation) of shameful misadventure, I hope he finds it comfortable under all that—like the Wicked Witch of the West’s sister whose feet curl up under the prairie farmhouse in which Dorothy crashed to earth.

Perhaps not an entirely appropriate analogy since Scheer, again, does not wear the Ruby Slippers. I always loved the part when the Witch—played by Margaret Hamilton in “The Wizard of Oz”—gets her fingers electrocuted when she covetously tries to remove the slippers from her dead sister’s feet without a smidgen of remorse for her sibling—that screech is indelibly etched in my cultural mind. I’m hoping to hear it again—real soon!

Thumbs up from a lucky voter whose first voting choice is also the best tactical choice to beat the Conservative candidate—and also proven a very good MP. NDP.

(BTW, I’m wondering if every ScheerCon candidate was instructed to roll an accusative ‘hand-grenade’ into the mix at the very last minute—like Scheer tried with his idiotic ‘Liberal-NDP coalition conspiracy’: our ScheerCon candidate out here—who hasn’t appeared at any town halls or all-candidates’ debates since the writ was dropped—made his debut public utterance on the last day of campaigning, accusing somebody of breaking election advertising rules. Anybody have a similar experience? Good luck, my Albertan friends!)

I would say that the Conservative commentators and politicians that dominate political discussion in Alberta, are not likely to be happy with the election outcome. They are the ones who shout the loudest in this province and assume they speak for everyone. They have tried to whip up an anti Trudeau, anti Liberal frenzy, both here in Alberta with some success and elsewhere with more mixed results, so if they fall short of winning they will be even more bitter than they are now.

Our first past the post system that the Conservatives so staunchly defended when we had a brief discussion about alternatives a few years ago is exactly that and tonight it may come back to bite them. Yes, it makes it easier for a party to win a majority government with a lower level of support (particularly if the Conservatives can nudge vote splitting between other parties to work in their favor as Harper did in 2011). However, there are more parties that are competitive now than in 2011, including a new one on the right. The Conservatives tepid campaign probably caused a lot of voters to look at the other alternatives to the Liberals and so they were never really able to reach that low threshold.

It will be interesting to see who wins the most seats, but even if the Conservatives do nudge out the Liberals by a little or even by a wider margin, they have little support among the other parties. It is possible a large BQ contingent might prop up the Conservatives from time to time, like they did for Harper in his minority government years. However, they have already said they are not supporting the Conservative repeal of the carbon tax and have zero interest in a national energy corridor proposed by the Conservatives and would not support weakening existing environmental initiatives. Therefore, I think a Conservative minority government would be essentially unable to move forward with any of their initiatives on energy.

With the rest of the world and the rest of Canada increasingly concerned about the environment, the Alberta energy industry is finding itself increasingly isolated. I think Alberta has lost a great deal of leverage federally by putting most of its eggs in one political basket and if it continues this strategy will lose even more. Perhaps the only happy politicians will be Conservative backbenchers here who don’t have to work very hard to get re-elected – very good job security for them and the provincial politicians here who find fighting against Ottawa helps distract the local voters from more troublesome things for them, like cuts to services and RCMP investigations of their own electoral shenanigans.

Well, as I watch the results, CBC has both Nenshi and some guy who represents Postmedia in Alberta going on about Alberta not being understood by the rest of the country. (You might as well throw in Saskatchewan and Manitoba too) They claim Alberta was the engine of growth in Canada.

I sincerely wonder if it has been, because the overwhelming preponderance of the Canadian population concentrated in Ontario and Quebec have probably put more absolute dollars into our growth than Alberta’s small population has. The growth may have been less in percentage terms no doubt, but multiplied by more than five times as many citizens in the two most populous provinces, the absolute increase has not been mainly due to Alberta. Nor has it cost $60 billion a year in petroil subsidies mainly to one province to achieve that growth, the vast majority of which money seems to disappear down the rathole into foreign pockets and is implausibly denied to have existed in the first place. Now we’ll get the business types and PostMedia, itself US-owned, bleating about future foreign investment declines in Canada, blindly ignoring how the rest of the country voted. We’ll all be dismissed as irrelevant by the Kenney and Prairie contingent, with Ford clapping along like a poodle behind while he remains in power and loses ever more popularity provincially.

It is this total misunderstanding of the dynamics of population in Canada that Albertans seem to resolutely miss, every single time for the last four decades. It is a desperate spot of navel-gazing that living in a bubble and believing your own nonsense brings to a province that just cannot do basic arithmetic. And to compound the unreality, only one seat in Alberta has gone anything but Conservative this time, despite the fact that 30% of the voters supported other parties. By voting so one-sidedly, Albertans have no doubt made the Conservative percentage of the popular vote greater than the Liberals by concentrating their support where they were going to win anyway. No doubt the Cons will try to make hay of that, just to be as difficult and divisive as usual.

The BQ with 32 seats virtually matches Alberta’s 34 Conservative seats. That’s population similarity, but I’d bet there are few people in Alberta who even consider that the BQ vote counts, while they feel far more important. In a so-called democracy, you cannot decide you’re more important than anyone else. That’s the rub, like it or not.

So, DJC, your feelings about official Alberta leaping up and down in frustration are bound to come true. In my opinion not for reasonable reasons, but with feelings so hurt, no amount of soothing balm will alleviate it for years to come.

Crazy times ahead indeed. And now as I finish, the Alberta PostMedia twerp gives May the gears as a failure being the climate change denier he is paid to be. At least the First Nations rep they have pointed out the obvious environmental problems in our North following that corporate nonsense. May Conrad Black, possible non-Canadian citizen but decidedly a pompous ass have a bad night’s sleep.

There’s certainly no shortage of safe Conservative seats in Alberta Jason Kenney could use to saddle up and ride back to Ottawa to save conservatism after Andrew Scheer’s disastrous impersonation of the Conservative Party of Canada’s leader ended in ignominy last night.

It takes a special talent to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory the way Mr. Scheer did — and if we know anything about Alberta’s newish Conservative premier, an Ottawa insider if ever there was one, it’s that unlikely catastrophic losses like Mr. Scheer’s are not part of his election night repertoire.


Will Alberta Premier Jason Kenney soon return to his old stomping grounds Ottawa? (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

You would have thought almost any Conservative leader could have crushed Justin Trudeau’s hopes after the prime minister’s dismal performance of the past couple of years — even Maxime Bernier!

So never let it be said that Mr. Scheer did nothing for Canada. Even though he’s not admitting it, he appears to have hired Warren Kinsella, the seemingly disaffected Liberal political consultant, to “seek and destroy” Mr. Bernier and his odious nativist People’s Party of Canada. That part at least worked out. Too bad for the Conservatives that Mr. Scheer himself may have suffered some collateral damage from the hire.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

So how about it, Stephanie Kusie? Are you ready to step aside in Calgary Midnapore to help catapult Mr. Kenney back to his old stomping grounds on the banks of the Rideau Canal? Mr. Kenney’s former Calgary riding has to be his sentimental favourite for the swift return to the nation’s capital he’s long been rumoured to be plotting.

There he is said to dream of becoming the Canadian prime minister whose leadership most resembles that of William Lyon Mackenzie King — “pay rent if necessary, but don’t necessarily pay rent” — something that Liberals who are entitled to feel relieved tonight should nevertheless take seriously.

Mr. Kenney is as formidable a campaigner as there is, whatever you may think of his divisive politics or the ethical standards of his leadership campaign, and anyone he challenges should take the challenge seriously.


Senator Paula Simons — is she soon to be the Liberal cabinet minister for Alberta? (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

For those in Alberta who will think they will be glad to see the departing back of Mr. Kenney as he heads back to Ottawa, if in fact that’s what he has in mind, I have just three words for them: Premier Jason Nixon. (History can blame him for the fallout from Thursday’s Alberta budget.) So be careful what you wish for!

And for those Conservatives pleased at least that the Liberals have been reduced to a minority and all but driven out of Alberta, I have some thoughts for them too.


Premier Jason Nixon? (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

First, the likely elevation of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to holder of the balance of power in the Parliament of Canada does not sound like good news for that pipeline expansion project Mr. Kenney and Opposition Leader Rachel Notley have persuaded Albertans is essential to our province’s economic future.

You’d better start making nice with Prime Minister Trudeau, as distasteful as that may seem to you, if you want to get what you say we must have. Unless, of course, you never really believed it and just used it as a stick to beat Mr. Trudeau. In which case, I suppose, carry on.


New Democrat Heather McPherson, after the dust settled last night, she was Alberta’s sole Opposition MP (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Second, how does the phrase “Independent Senator Paula Simons, Liberal minister of the Crown,” sound to you? It sounds fine to me, by the way, and a happy development for a fine journalist who just months ago was trapped toiling for the wretched Postmedia chain — which surely the prime minister will now stop considering subsidizing with our tax dollars!

Don’t like the sound of that, well, how about Minister Heather McPherson in the coalition government? Less likely, I grant you, but not impossible. Ms. McPherson was the only non-Conservative member still standing last night in Alberta. She was elected for Mr. Singh’s New Democrats in Edmonton Strathcona, despite another Mainstreet Research poll that apparently wasn’t exactly as advertised.

Or how about the self-fulfilling Conservative prophesy: Ambassador Rachel Notley. (If it happens, just remember where you heard it first.)

I am sure the Conservatives will be going on about their “moral” victory, despite previously being the strongest proponents of first past the post. It will probably resonate well with around 34.5% of the population and go over like a thud with the majority. If insanity is repeating the same thing and hoping for a better result, the current Conservative leadership should be committed immediately. Appealing to a committed base who turns out to vote can only get you so far, particularly if that base resides in places like rural Alberta where they don’t need more votes to win seats.

A realistic plan on climate change, might have lost them a seat or two in Alberta, but gained them more elsewhere in a country increasingly concerned about climate change. It is is not 2008 any more, Mr. Scheer is not quite as clever as Mr. Harper and Mr. Trudeau is still a far better campaigner than Mr. Dion, despite all his current troubles.

I suppose there are now two serious dilemas for local Conservatives. First, the Liberals are shut out of Alberta now, so Mr. Trudeau is less constrained to support the environment over energy. Alberta has again put almost all of its eggs in the basket of the losing party. In particular Edmonton and Calgary may find themselves in a weak position in looking for future infrastructure funding. Second, they have a dilema about what to do with Mr. Scheer. If he couldn’t beat Mr. Trudeau after all the self inflicted damage over the last nine months, he is likely not the guy to do it. They will need to act quickly because minority governments do not generally last long, usually only a couple of years.

In the end it wasn’t the loss of four Alberta seats that reduced the Liberals to a minority. If it were not for the resurgence of the BQ in Quebec that kept over 20 seats out of the Liberals hands, its quite possible the Liberals could have got still got a majority despite their losses here and elsewhere.

Federal election 2019 was not all for naught — especially relative to significant Conservative losses and other momentous electoral events.

The ever polemical Lisa Raitt from Milton, Ontario — her of the bleached-blonde Three Amigos CPC posse that consisted of Candice Bergen, Michelle Rempel and Raitt — lost badly to a star Liberal candidate by 8,600 votes. In Edmonton Strathcona, Heather McPherson torched CPC candidate Sam Lilly by 10 points and 5,500+ votes, which according to the conservatively tendentious Postmedia National Post was a “narrow” defeat for Lilly. And just for fun, Jody Wilson-Raybould figuratively gave Justin Trudeau the proverbial middle finger by winning the riding of Vancouver Granville as an Independent. What’s not to like there? (Sadly, Jane Philpott another ousted former Liberal cabinet member did not fare as well.) And can Canadians now safely say we are finally rid of Maxime Bernier after his calamitous fall from political grace after losing his Quebec seat? One can only hope.

What a perfect storm for continued inaction on pretty much everything. Conservatives can continue to complain about pipelines to those who still naively believe that is an answer. Trudeau can continue to claim strong action on climate change and the environment by increasing our indulgence, carbon, tax. Again not really doing anything but it provides good talking points.
Will the knives come out for Singh as they did for Mulcair when again NDP seats are down almost by half? Will Sheer be allowed to stick around? Is Kenney the answer for Conservative’s future? The longer Kenney sticks around in the premier’s office and his promises don’t materialize the less likely this happens one hopes. It is interesting that Ford was kept away from the federal campaign while Kenney who will follow the same austerity path as Ford wasn’t.

Regarding your latter point, it’s because Ontario has a tendency to vote opposite to the party that is in power provincially. Given the number of seats in play in the 416 and 905 area codes, this was a Real threat to the Conservatives. That and Doug Ford is very unpopular in Ontario, even with some Conservative supporters.

We’re going travelling today so don’t have time to comment long, but this nonsense about how PMJT can’t proceed with a pipeline because the NDP will frown on it and the Greenies will begin a great big pout is really something. Of course the CPC MPs will vote for it, and the NDP/GPC will vote for environmental changes that the CPC refuses to. It will be a helluva balancing act but that’s the norm these days.

Please explain, someone, how an Alberta CPC MP would justify voting against anything to do with TMP?

If the pipeline (s) is (are) to be built, the Cons will need to co-operate with the Libs. What the federal NDP or the Bloc or the Greens think won’t matter in the seat numbers game.
So, can you imagine the Cons will be able to tone down their vituperation of the Trudeau Libs so as to push the project forward? Me neither. You, David, have pointed out a few times how counter-productive Alberta’s vilification of Trudeau is. That’s the only tune the Cons here can play.

And still there is nothing in the MSM, such as the monopoly is here and in much of Canada, or in other media for that matter, as to why so many of the world’s large oil companies have vacated Alberta. The pitiful protesters of the Yellow Vest – Canada version – have no knowledge of such regress, while still insisting that the only thing that Alberta has going for it is oil (as did Nemshi on the little panel on CBC election coverage last night). I know we will be using fossil fuels for quite some time yet, but maybe, if lucky, not as much (Asthma does not permit me holding my breathe, but even without that impediment, I would not do so!). No one wants to ask why the rest of the world seems not to want our cheap “dregs of the fossil fuels” (this from the ‘old’ oil men who knew about the quality of tar sands).

Watching from the West Coast I must admit I worried predictions of the Dippers’ demise might not have been exaggerated; it seemed plain the Liberals would hang on to power from the very first Atlantic returns, but the NDP—after being all but shut out of ridings east of the Capital, mostly by the resurgent Bloc Québécois, and remaining in the single digits for most of the evening—began to pick up seats west of the Rockies, including Big Island seats the Greens were predicted to win. Texting and phoning back and forth between here and Vancouver where my significant other does grandmother duty —and voted—in Jody’s riding was exciting enough, first when we realized the Dippers were going to hold the balance of power, next as the GreenCon threats to NDP incumbent seats on the Big Island fell one by one, and finally to the supreme relief that the competitive Conservative didn’t slip up the split in Jody’s riding—she took it herself, the only Independent elected to the HoC. What a night! (But if I have to endure too much pro-rep babble, my head’s gonna explode.)

Next, the obligatory speeches form leaders before capping the night with emails, texts and messages to relieved NDP MPs on the Big Island—and to my Green compatriots who voted with their heads, not their hearts, to help us thrash the ScheerCon Candidates we were afraid would win if the vote was split.

The speeches seemed arranged to happen at nearly the same time (modern technology really helped). I was too tired to appreciate much of a Schadenfreude moment for Green leader May who’d predicted her party would take every single riding on the Big Island only the day before (she kept her own seat with a reduced, but very convincing percentage of the riding vote, and the other Green incumbent who only won his seat in a by-election last spring hung on to a shrinking lead for the win) only to end up winning exactly the same two Green seats. But I was happy at least one more Green was elected in New Brunswick, another place where the movement made its debut provincially before a hesitant foray into federal politics.

Trudeau’s speech was sickly sweet and predictable.

Only heard that Bernier got thrashed (thank goodness!)—but didn’t bother with the concession speech. Blanchet was risible —as far as my fading french could discern. I heard Jody say “WoW!”over the phone from my sweetie’s TV—that’s all. Naturally I was happy to listen to Jagmeet who didn’t disappoint and maintained his respect and optimism despite his likely elevation to the second-most important politician in the larger half of North America. I haven’t felt this proud since Mulcair went into the last campaign as leader of the most popular party in Canada—another first for the NDP after Layton won the Loyal Opposition before dying of cancer almost immediately after that astounding win.

But it was Scheer’s speech I really wanted to hear. After predicting he’d be toast if he didn’t win at least a minority, I realized I hadn’t figured his CPC would win the so-called “popular vote”. I thought it would therefore be an occasion to confidently concede with grace, the consolation probably being the next best thing—an improvement over last time and a proverbial silver lining.

I was surprised to hear his unconcealed bitterness—to be expected, I suppose—underpin an angry, defiant, threatening—even vengeful tone. No congratulation to the winner but, rather, a prediction: “when”, not if, the Liberal government falls, “ Conservatives will be ready!” And then: to return to the conservative principles Canada was [supposedly] built upon. He went on to remind the two spare-cloth prairie provinces that JT is out to destroy them and their industry and that he could not represent them. Nice, Andrew, really nice.

Was he defending himself against the speculated leadership challenge by returning to the well of hatred his colleague Jason KeKangaroo Kenney has dug in the province he is now—for a time, anyway—premier of? Scheer seemed to be talking only to his base—obvious to any Canadian outside of it.

One look at the map made me shake my head at such a spiteful concession speech from the man who would be prime minister of the entire country. Apparently he thinks winning the popular vote entitles him to keep the gin flowing to his snarling base (it was on hand, anyhow, for the hoped-for win) even though not really a majority achievement. But the map says a lot: the coasts are red in the East where Saudi oil comes in and orange in the West where dilbit leaks out and, with the Bloc’s light blue covering that distinct shape of Quebec and the ScheerCons’ dark blue concentrated in small agricultural regions of Annapolis, St Lawrence, southern Ontario, Okanagan and Lower Mainland BC, then all of Saskatchewan and nearly all Alberta—the country looks partitioned very neatly. That’s somehow worrisome.

What bugs me is that a palpable atmosphere of anger has developed across these partitions: Atlantic Canada for its chronic economic stagnation, Quebec for its nationalist frustration, Ontario for its D’ohFo, and the Wet Coat because of pipeline proposals—and therefore that Scheer appeared ready to cultivate that when he should have been showing his five kids what good sportsmanship is—especially by a leader who would be prime minister of this diverse nation.

Haven’t really analyzed the riding results across the country yet. There’s lots of time for that. Wait see what happens next.

Way to go, Strathcona! (I used to occasion the eponymous hotel when I lived there, years ago.)

Good luck Alberta!

Not yet having had the chance to analyze the results riding by riding, all I can offer now are general impressions, but they are not positive ones. The CPC vote in AB & SK is highly concentrated in rural ridings, where they garnered over 75% of the votes in many seats. Meanwhile, over in BC, they also won seats in the Interior — including Prince George-Peace River-Northern Rockies (which is really almost Albertan, and the heart of BC’s oilpatch), where they got 70% of the vote — but aside from that one seat, the ScheerCons’ vote share was in the mid- to high-40s in the seats they took. This is a respectable level of support, but not as lopsided as AB & SK.

In fact, I expect that after people have had time to review the results in detail, we will find that nowhere in Canada were the CPC wins so lopsided as in rural AB & SK. In fact, I don’t think any other seat anywhere in Canada, regardless of who won, will be as lopsided as a typical rural Alberta Conservative seat.

51,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Kenney to Trudeau: Adopt Andrew Scheer’s energy platform or Alberta will hold a meaningless equalization referendum,2019-10-23 02:23:00,David Climenhaga,,"If you concluded as New Brunswick’s Conservative premier just did that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s somewhat reduced victory in Monday’s federal election indicates a certain level of support for carbon taxes and like policies in Canada, the premiers of Alberta and Saskatchewan beg to differ.

Blaine Higgs told reporters in Fredericton yesterday that he’s now going to figure out how to comply with the Trudeau Government’s national climate plan, which includes a carbon tax. “I can’t ignore the obvious,” he explained. “The country has spoken.”


Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe (Photo: Twitter).

“People voted for it, so we have to find a way in New Brunswick to make it work,” Mr. Higgs also observed.

Out here on the Great Plains, though, we’re made of sterner stuff. We don’t have any problem ignoring the obvious. And, no, we’re not going to find a way to make federal policies work in Alberta or Saskatchewan if they don’t happen to have been made by Conservatives. (Or even, as in the case of the current equalization formula, if they were.)

The Liberals may have a renewed if reduced mandate, but here on the Great Plains, we’re sticking with the same old climate obstructionism.

Accordingly, Premier Jason Kenney called the pliant local media together in Edmonton yesterday and told them, in effect, that if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won’t adopt most of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s energy platform, as well as find a way to gut the Constitution’s equalization provisions, Alberta will hold a provincial referendum on equalization.


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Alert readers will quickly point out that such a referendum would be constitutionally meaningless. This is true, as Mr. Kenney certainly knows.

However, it’s clearer every day that Mr. Kenney views the referendum idea, tied to Alberta’s perpetual complaining about Quebec getting “our” money and then not running its financial affairs the same way we run ours, as a thinly disguised sovereignty-association vote.

Or, at least, he clearly hopes the federal Liberals, in a slightly more vulnerable position than they were before Monday’s vote, will see it that way.

It would be interesting to know if such a deceptive tactic contradicts the federal Clarity Act, which says the wording of any sovereignty referendum must state clearly what it means.


New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

Regardless, perhaps confusing the election results on the Prairies with the national tally, Mr. Kenney told the reporters he had set out his demands in a five-page letter — five pages! must be serious! — to Mr. Trudeau.

The letter calls on Ottawa to create a national energy corridor, repeal the North Coast tanker ban, delay implementation of more stringent pipeline approval legislation, let Alberta off the hook for the federal carbon tax, and make big changes to federal transfer payments to suit Alberta.

Mr. Kenney made the referendum threat during the provincial election campaign last spring, in reference to Ottawa’s carbon tax. This time, it was tied to Ottawa’s tanker ban legislation. Blackmail being what it is, however, it’s reasonable to assume that if it works now it will soon be applied to another Alberta demand.

Mr. Kenney also told media and MLAs in the Legislature he will soon strike yet another “expert panel” to hold hearings on how unhappy Albertans are with Confederation. Presumably the opinions of Albertans who are happy with Confederation will not be particularly welcome.


Ontario-born social conservative Wexit enthusiast Craig B. Chandler (Photo: Facebook).

The names of the putative experts will be announced soon. No word on how much this will cost in these supposedly straightened times.

Meanwhile, in the Prairie province next door, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe was doing much the same thing yesterday, telling his compliant local reporters that the prime minister must kill the carbon tax, allow lots of pipelines to be built, and negotiate a new equalization formula — because, you know, western alienation.

Speaking of which, Mr. Kenney’s posturing and claims that even “political moderates” of his acquaintance are openly talking about Alberta separation certainly seem to have really stirred up the province’s “Wexit” nuts — some of whom hastily organized a luncheon yesterday at a Calgary Chinese restaurant to discuss creating a united Wexit campaign.

That scheme was cooked up by Craig B. Chandler, the Hamilton, Ont., native notorious in these parts for views so far to the right he was made unwelcome in both the old Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. Apparently he has found a more congenial home in Mr. Kenney’s United Conservative Party, though.

A summary of the views of many of the folks who have been publicly advocating the Wexit cause — parodied as Weave or Rednexit by detractors on social media — suggests they dream of a sort of independent northern version of Alabama or Mississippi, with no gun control, no union rights, no human rights, no abortion rights, no seaport and no industry but dirty oil.

We in the West should remember that the current equalization formula was set in place during Stephen Harper’s time as Prime minister.

We should also remember that Harper promised Saskatchewan’s then premier Lorne Calvert that he would remove non renewable resources (Oil and minerals) from the formula, but in his last ten years as PM didn’t remove them from the formula as promised. Possibly because doing so would have caused him problems in the rest of the country.

While we are remembering things from the past, the idea for a carbon tax was first floated by Preston Manning on behalf of the big oil companies because it would be paid by consumer’s instead of oil producers.

So our troubles out west are partially created by western interests.

All benefit, no cost, right?
The ‘Wexit-eers’ so to speak are dismal economists and businessmen in the sense that they fomenting separation without being honest about the cost of separation.
Over the last 40 years or so, this cost would be simply put in one word: remediation. The cost of remediation and reparation given the damage that has been done to the environment would probably be in the $1,000,000,000,000 range. Yes, ONE TRILLION DOLLARS.
Also, add to the fact that we need a ‘poison pill’ that would allow any First Nations organizations and land holdings to be recognized as theirs to claim first and ‘Alberta’ will simply be a little less than ‘A’.
Finally, we could tack on the original tab of things like social services and payments that have been made to Alberta over the last 150 years, including construction of the railway, healthcare transfer payments, subsidies to the oil and gas sector and ongoing annuities in the form of millions of ‘eastern’ homeowners being connected to natural gas. Again, I’d suggest the tally would likely be an even additional trillion dollars.

So, Alberta: will that be cash or cheque to cover your costs?

Oh, where to start with all this Conservative silliness? They are even more cranky and out of sorts than usual after losing the election. Even Mr. Scheer’s brave save face comments about moral victories are not going to satisfy them now, particularly when he managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of possible victory. There seems to be an unstated leadership competition starting in who can shout the loudest and be the angriest.

The Conservatives may soon be going down the path of the Tea Party Repiblicans. Of course, the more reasonable ones like the NB premier are already quietly geting off the crazy train before it really goes off the rails, leaving more room for people like Mr. Chandler. Speaking of which, why is it some of the wackiest people in Alberta politics seem to come from Ontario?

Last I checked equalization was a Federal thing and part of taxes collected by Ottawa. I suppose Mr. Kenney can hold a referendum if he wishes, but it will have absolutely no legal power. While he is at it, he might as well also hold a few Senator elections too, you know to further distact from his cuts. However, the risk of all these ineffective measures is Albertans might turn on him when they realize there is a lot of heat and light, but he is accomplishing so little.

Of course all First Nations lands will be left behind.. and what Indian Tribe could complain in BC about their territories being slithered or slipslided across.. in the spirit of white mumbo jumbo Doug Ford, ‘not a single tree will lose its pine needles’ .. Will Kenney tear up the tracks.. horrify Gordon Lightfoot ? Will he leave a ‘legacy’ (which actually means gift) behind ? IE the tar sands tailing ponds.. ? The National Parks are not his to take either of course.. so Banff National, Wood Buffalo, Jasper.. what other National Parks will be left behind ? A new currency ? Will banks remain ? Airports close ? The man is a thuggist idealogue.. whipping up anger just like Donald Trump.. Ulp.. the remediation of oil and gas wells, the tar sands.. he gonna fix all that before splitsville ?

Nothing funnier than an angry little man telling the whole world he’s going to burn it all down.

Jason Kenney just threw a tantrum.

Oooooooooooo….

The referendum will be meaningless, and rendered even more meaningless when that video pops up (again and again) of federal minister Kenney defending the equalization formula over a decade ago.

The only thing that’s even funnier than being an angry little man throwing tantrums is being an angry little man throwing tantrums over an issue that he was on the other side of at one time.

J.K. was looking forward to PM Scheer letting him run riot over everyone. Now, with PMJT insulated by a pretty solid minority government, with the potential for support from the nearly broken NDP, as well as a very compliant BQ, there is no reason why the Liberal government cannot see through to the end its current mandate unscathed.

The only excitement will be Jason Kenney stabbing Scheer in the back and demanding he become PM.

Or we’ll all be swept into the Nine Circles of Hell.

Reading the text of the letter is possible on Twitter, if you don’t mind doing successive screen captures and enhancing the text. Using Twitter for dissemination of official documents via Twitter is a pretty bonehead move, and is something another well-known bonehead does.

As for another comment about Kenney’s blue pick-up truck, funny thing about Kenney driving a truck. I recall then when Kenney was director of the nascent CTF, he never drove himself anywhere. He didn’t own a car, so he often relied on taxis, sometimes used public transit, or got a lift from a political ally with a ride. When he became an MP and a minister of the Crown, Kenney was chauffeured everywhere. It leaves me to wonder if he even knows how to drive, let alone even got his driver’s licence.

So it would seem that Kenney’s own reputation as a pick-up truck driving guy is about as fake as everything else about him.

I’m quite happy to let the ring-wing nuts waste their energies on Wexit. Take a look around: almost all Albertans are loyal Canadians. Alberta has never, in 114 years, elected a separatist MP. Last Monday Quebec elected 32.

Alberta once had a separatist MLA (Gordon Kesler). He won a by-election in 1982 and was defeated 6 months later. I suppose if you really wanted to build a separatist movement in Alberta you would have to build a provincial separatist party (like the PQ) and a federal separatist party (like the BQ). I can’t see Alberta Conservatives liking that very much.

As an aside, although I’m not a Liberal supporter, I’ve always liked cabinet minister Amarjeet Sohi. The Conservatives pulled out all the stops to replace him with a retreaded poll, Tim Uppal. Now they lament that there will be no Alberta MPs in the cabinet. As Abraham Lincoln said: “Hypocrite: The man who murdered his parents, and then pleaded for mercy on the grounds that he was an orphan.”

If you do the math it is quite interesting. 66% of Canadian voted, of those that voted 33% voted for the federal Liberal’s. So only 21.78% of Canadians voted for Justin Trudeau to be our Prime Minister. And yet he says he has a strong mandate to govern, yikes! It is interesting to note that under his watch the Bloc Québécois has risen from the dead and at the same time western alienation has reached new heights! Regardless which way you look at it Justin Trudeau has made one hell of a mess. Enjoy your day.

Brian: you can turn those numbers on their head as Farmer Dave just did. Most Canadians voted against the Conservatives. Even in Alberta a big part of the population voted against the Conservatives. So not everybody goes to your church. In fact most of us do not go to church at all.
But yeah, in an evidence based world, Trudeau should never had bought the Trans Mountain Pipeline. Whether he was conned or he thought he was helping people like you who rely on off-farm income from oil and gas does not matter. Delivering more high sulfur oil into a world market that does not want to pay for it is a bad idea.
So it is too bad about all those abandoned oil/gas wells on your farm you mentioned in another post. That is a big environmental liability against your land. Hopefully they are cleaned up by the time you need the money for the old folks home, but I would not bet on it.
The oil boom is over and it will not come back in our lifetimes. Blaming Trudeau and the NDP for not bringing it back and not cleaning up the mess left by the total screw up of the Klein/Manning/Harper Conservatives is disingenuous. Throwing a tantrum because two thirds of Canadians can see the boom is over is just childish.
Have a nice day.

Sir: the ScheerCons’ message clearly did not resonate with voters outside of their Saskaberta redoubt. In The Rest of Canada, their popular vote share was only 28.6% (Credit to Maclean’s’ Jason Markusoff for these calculations). That means that outside of Alberta & Saskatchewan, there was more than a 72% consensus around being more proactive on climate change than the Conservatives were propose to be. So, all Scott Moe & Jason Kenney are demonstrating with their lett RNs to the feds, is that they clearly aren’t listening to the message Canada’s broader electorate is sending: yes to pricing carbon, yes to moving to a decarbonized economy, and no to more pipelines & continued expansion of the oil & gas industry — differences between the Liberals, NDP & Greens on this issue are more around speed, deadlines & evidence of commitment, rather than ultimate goals.

And, with all due respect, you are also not listening to the voters. They have — except here — rejected the dog-eat-dog Conservative worldview in favour of a more progressive approach to public policy.

What we really need is faster-acting plate tectonics to remodel Canadian geography: how about inserting Quebec between Alberta and BC? Both sets of separatists could keep each other busy, and let the rest of the country go on about its business. (We’d need to hope, of course, that the Rockies maintained their height through all this upheaval.)

Sure, we should put the environment more at risk because you think life isn’t fair. Sounds like Alberta needs a time out. Invest in renewable energy. The heyday of oil and gas is over. Be a leader in the future. In the meantime, get over it. No one wants your black venom piped across their land. We also don’t want leaky tankers along the coast either.

You did well as a province for a long time and that’s great for you. Times change. Change with them or leave and then enjoy needing to over tax your citizens to stay afloat in your land locked existence.

Appropriately enough, it’s time for those of us who live here in Wild Rose Country to cry, “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!”

Alberta is Alberta again! Yesterday’s vicious austerity budget proves it.

Alberta’s once again the poor little rich kid of Confederation, crying poverty, throwing its weight around, and careering from knee-jerk austerity to pre-election profligacy as the province’s economy careens from boom to bust.

As of yesterday, pretty much as when Ralph Klein was still running the place, we were back to operating like what University of Alberta Professor Russell Cobb describes as the failed state of Oklahoma, except that this time we’ve already seen the movie and we know it doesn’t have a happy ending.

Mr. Klein, who went to his eternal reward in 2013, did a lot of damage to Alberta with his austerity campaign through the 1990s, keeping taxes ridiculously low by running on fossil fuel royalties, leaving a huge infrastructure deficit, and putting health care into a state of chaos from which it’s never quite recovered.

That said, feckless as he was, Mr. Klein didn’t encourage actual separatist lunatics to torque up the fight with Ottawa that all Alberta premiers have, or set up an inquisition with a snitch line to justify a discredited conspiracy theory. And he threw Stephen Harper’s independantiste Firewall Manifesto into the trashcan where it belonged instead of recycling it.

Plus, then-premier Klein — who as a matter of historical record thought now-Premier Kenney was a sanctimonious pest — had no ambition to be prime minister of Canada and never campaigned very enthusiastically for the federal chapter of his party. By contrast, it was to accommodate the Blue Team in the recent federal campaign — won by Mr. Kenney’s arch foe, Liberal Justin Trudeau on Monday — that explains why this first UCP budget had to wait more than six months to get to the floor of the Legislature.

Mr. Klein also didn’t engage in serial climate change denial and obstructionism, although planetary warming wasn’t really a thing yet. But he could actually get along with public sector unions when he tried.

Judging from yesterday’s budget and recent pronouncements recorded in this space, Mr. Kenney seems determined to bring us the worst of the Klein years with none of the occasional flashes of cheerful decency or self-deprecating humour Mr. Klein sometimes offered up.

When the dust has settled, the cuts in yesterday’s budget — introduced by Finance Minister Travis Toews, as is tradition; wearing an old pair of cowboy boots, as isn’t — will work out to about the same as Mr. Klein’s, maybe worse.

That is to say, if you add budgeted cuts of “only” 2.8 per cent a year over the life of the four-year fiscal plan to the combined expected annual impact of population growth and inflation, it’s the ’90s all over again. The UCP says that doesn’t matter. It does.

And this time, if the prognosticators are right, there may never be another petroleum boom, which apparently doesn’t bother anyone around here enough to stop running the economy on fumes and implement a sensible taxation scheme so we can manage the place like grownups.

Indeed, Mr. Toews indicated the UCP would impose more austerity — the opposite of what most economists recommend — if there is a worldwide recession. So do up your seatbelts, Albertans.

The strong revenge aspect to this budget will see big cuts to civil service jobs, attempted rollbacks to public employees’ pay, skyrocketing university tuition, smackdowns for uppity municipalities, and two major hospital projects put on ice in disloyal Edmonton while a big one proceeds in more reliably Conservative Calgary.

This may or may not result in the made-in-Alberta recession the Alberta Federation of Labour predicted the day before yesterday. And it may or may not result in the creation of many jobs, as the government promises. But it will certainly prompt howls of unhappiness when Albertans begin to feel the pain.

Not that that will make much difference. Chances are good Mr. Kenney will successfully channel the rage back onto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, equalization payments to Quebec, carbon taxes, and the failure of Ottawa to complete the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion by yesterday.

Experiencing déjà vu all over again, Alberta’s beleaguered progressives are preparing to resist this foolishness as best they can. The smart money says there’s not much they can do.

But just remember, folks, in 1415, the smart money wasn’t on the English army with King Henry in the vasty fields of France —outnumbered, poorly armed, demoralized, and far from home. And just look what happened on this day that year at Agincourt!

I recall from my brief encounters with Jason Kenney. Back then he was still in his 20s, the director of the CTF, and a prospective Reform Party MP, he was imbued with the arrogance of youth and as pompous as any rebellious punk could be. Free of the responsibilities of family, a relationship, or anything that even remotely looked like a normal life, Kenney was a raging ideologue determined to remake the world in his own image. Like his fellow traveller, Ezra Levant, he was determined to “Burn, baby. Burn” and to hell with the consequences. Well, Alberta just bought itself a ton of crazy. Thanks to the reemergence of the US as a major O&G exporting nation, Alberta’s fossil fuel yogurt is so much trouble, you can’t give it away. Add into that Kenney’s determination to return to Ottawa on the backs of Albertans just proves that (maybe) the Alberta voter is the stupidest person alive.

As Alberta is devastated for the sake of Kenney’s aspirations of triumphantly enter the PMO, I no doubt that Albertans will continue to rail against Trudeau, believe every word that Rebel Media says, and forever hope for the next boom.

And they promise – really promise – to not piss the next boom away.

This is a reminder as to where Alberta’s finances went. People need to share this as much as possible. The Alberta PCs, after Peter Lougheed left office, are the ones who virtually depleted Alberta’s finances, from multitudes of very costly scandals and neglect. Since 1986, the Alberta PCs allowed very poor oil royalty rates for our oil, depriving Alberta of $200 billion. Since 1986, the Alberta PCs virtually depleted the Heritage Savings Trust Fund, leaving hardly anything in it. Ralph Klein used it for very costly scandals, like Alpac/Mitsubishi, to help finance his provincial election campaigns, and to help pay off the provincial debt/deficit. Since 1986, the Alberta PCs did the most costliest scandals in Canada’s history. The $67 million Gainer’s scandal, the Principle Trust scandal, wasted $110 million on a metal smelting plant screwup, did the $600 million NovaTel scandal, the now $5 billion, (and growing) Swan Hills waste treatment plant blunder, the $180 million Miller West Pulp Mill debacle, the $240 million MagCan scandal, blew almost $500 million, trying to bail out West Edmonton Mall, did the $125 million ambulance amalgamation screwup, the $100 million A.I.S.H scandal, (which was complete with Ralph Klein and his colleagues, laughing at and mocking the handicapped on T.V), made us pay for the Stockwell Day defamation lawsuit costs, did the $400 million B.S.E bailout failure, the $34.5 billion electricity deregulation disaster, the $7 billion PPA debacle, that went with it, wasted $2 billion on carbon capture and storage, wasted money on luxury penthouse suites, wasted money on expensive plane flights, with no extra passengers, did the $26 billion Northwest Upgrader fiasco, that had $9 billion in added costs, made us pay for Alison Redford’s $10 billion tobaccogate lawsuit scheme, which she did and got away with, has expensive lawsuit costs against the Alberta government, in relation to the numerous deaths of foster children in Alberta, left Albertans with a $260 billion bill to cleanup abandoned oil wells in Alberta, and so much more. In 2014, corporations in Alberta owed $1.1 billion in unpaid taxes. For many years prior, corporations in Alberta owed very large amounts of money that went uncollected by the Alberta PCs. After Peter Lougheed left office, the Alberta PCs badly neglected infrastructure in Alberta, leaving Alberta with a $26 billion infrastructure debt. The Alberta PCs put in taxes of various sorts. Taxes on liquor, taxes on tobacco products, taxes on beverage container purchases in Alberta, taxes on motel stays in Alberta, with health care premiums in Alberta, with VLTs in Alberta, (it’s a regressive type of tax), taxes on electronic purchases in Alberta, and with Ed Stelmach’s carbon tax, (Jason Kenney did not get rid of Alberta’s carbon tax, as it’s still there). The UCP’s corporate tax cuts have lost Alberta $4.5 billion. The UCP has made over $13 billion in very costly mistakes so far. Because Saudi Arabia and America have had a vice grip on oil prices, since 2014, keeping oil prices low, how will Jason Kenney’s corporate tax cuts help with the revenue issue? These corporate tax cuts have not produced a single job. What were Albertans thinking, after voting in this garbage? Expect more crime, more poverty, more homelessness and more desperation with this UCP disaster budget. Peter Lougheed would be disgusted with this, if he were still around.

Today we hear that the Norwegian fund has passed a significant milestone. They have taken their oil money and invested it to benefit their populace.

DC, I had a slightly different reaction to the Budget. It was odd that Mr Toews invoked the virtue of courage in his speech. What I’m seeing is a cowardly lion. After repeatedly citing the McKinnon report he made none of the tough calls that McKinnon advocated. As you and others have pointed out, following the McKinnon report would have led to significant closures of rural hospitals, reduction to the number of physicians, and elimination of specific government programs. Instead the pusillanimous proposals of Mr Toews just kick all the hard decisions downstairs. What 2100 jobs will be cut in government? “Not to worry ‘attrition’ will take care of that”. Any other government in Canada could have told Mr Toews, that doesn’t work. Attrition doesn’t happen where you want it. Reducing expenditures to colleges, universities and municipalities, and flat school grants and health spending despite a growing population is based on more magical thinking: “we’ll just make it someone else’s problem”. Asking public sector unions to “do their bit”? Please. Higher tuition, higher municipal taxes, and delays in much needed infrastructure are the inevitable result. Mr Toews thinks he can float above it all. Really, what this budget shows is a big courage deficit.

So what does this mean to you? “measures to reduce the rate of growth in the supply of physicians will be necessary to reduce the rate of growth in physician compensation costs.”

Apparently “Alberta boasts a world-renowned resource base, a stable, business-friendly environment, highly competitive tax structure, a young and highly educated workforce, and some of the strongest economic fundamentals in the country.” Yet we must cut?

It is interesting that instead of providing support for upgrader development they have instead decided to cut future revenue through royalty reduction. Wonder who convinced them this was a good idea?

There is a lot of pausing in indexing for seniors and aish recipients particularly which gives the cover of not being an actual cut but really is about 3%. To top things off they are cutting support for small brewers so we can’t even drown our sorrows in a quality Alberta microbrew.

The brunt of the education cuts won’t hit parents until next year it appears.

I believe I read somewhere that this budget is reducing funding to the municipalities. Klein did the same thing and because the municipalities had to raise taxes to make up for it, my property taxes went from $30.00 a year to over $800.00 a year that it is now. If I’ve done the math right that’s a 2500% increase since his reign. It’s such an insidious maneuver seeing as how most people have mortgages and don’t even know what they pay in property taxes as they are included in their mortgage payment.

Some budget related comments:
Klein got away with his cuts because he was fortunate to have high natural gas prices and royalties at the time, and also had a number of public assets that he was able to privatize and sell off. The UCP does not have that luxury. Unless they get very lucky with a mini-oil boom due to unforeseeable circumstances 3 years from now, people might be very angry with them.

In spite of all the anti-tax rhetoric in the UCP campaign, and in the general public, and the frequently repeated mantra that we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem, it is interesting (and one could say hypocritical on their part) to see that they HAVE addressed revenue in small ways and in fact raised taxes. Apart from raising taxes on tobacco and other things, and various fees, they have 1) stopped adjusting the tax brackets and personal exemption for inflation and 2) eliminated the tuition and education deductions. While the second of these could easily be dismissed by many because students rarely pay much tax, this is not quite true, because A) students can carry over those deductions for future years when they are no longer studying and actually making money B) (perhaps more immediate), in many cases $ 5000 of those deductions is being claimed by parents or guardians of the students (that is 500 extra in the tax bill of a lot of people — in the tens of thousands, I would guess; my own taxes (total) for 2018 would have increased by about 1.8 % with this change, but the percent increase in Provincial income tax would have been much larger – over 6.5 % – last year was the last one in which I had an eligible dependent in full time studies). By raising the interest rates on student loans, and giving institutions license to raise tuition fees rapidly, they have certainly not done anything to make life more affordable for Albertans – which is kind of funny considering how often their federal allies went on about affordability being the big issue for Canadians.

This is going to get worse – the proverbial will really hit the fan when health care, schools, colleges and Universities have to find ways to balance their budgets, and collective agreements get thrown out the window to reduce compensation.

Alberta always was Alberta, even when the ‘socialists’ were briefly in charge. The only thing that has changed is the hysteria injected into the renewed campaign to find scapegoats for both the operational mismanagement of the oil and gas royalty revenue framework and what will surely be a slow painful sunset as the economic transition unfolds.

For example,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/10/new-york-city-sues-shell-exxonmobil-and-other-oil-majors-over-climate-change/ )

In the meantime, for industry and its shareholders it has been an economic windfall, for the hypothetical owners of the resource, not so much.

And so, the PR and lobbying campaign for the oil and gas industry is now being conducted directly from the Legislature by the oil and gas industry preferred candidate. As part of the fantasy and fear campaign, “Alberta United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney closed out the weekend’s Manning Networking Conference in Ottawa by suggesting the oil industry is “under massive attack.” “That engine of our prosperity is under massive attack.”

Of course, the reality is only ‘slightly different’, where; “Royalties have collapsed by 59% or $9.5 billion from 2000-2017, despite more than doubling oil production and increasing combined oil and gas production by 47%.” And, “Royalty percentage on sales revenue has collapsed from 19.5% to 5.1% in Alberta from 2000-2017.” Meanwhile, oil sands production has grown 376% from 2000-2018.

That is the difference between the proverbial mine and the shaft and also, like the cartoon says, “What you environmentalists have got to understand, is the destruction of the planet may be the price we have to pay for a healthy economy.”

I think the initial advantage in this battle, which will probably end up being long, drawn out and fought on many fronts, will go to the government. The UCP campaigned on some vague sort of spending restraint, which voters sort of endorsed and it will take a while for the public to digest everything they are doing. It will also take a while before the full impact of the cuts is really felt by the public.

If it appears, that the reaction to the cuts by opponents is too reflexive and just from the expected people the government has already declared war on, this may not persuade the broader public. So rather than rush into battle right away, the response needs to be planned and reasoned in a way the broader public can accept and support.

One of the disadvantages the government has is these cuts are very broad, so far reaching and enduring (for over three year into the future). An overall cut of 2.8% does not sound like much, but in an attempt to perhaps limit the fall out in the very sensitive area of health care, which accounts for a large part of of government spending, much bigger cuts have to be made to various other areas. The cuts to university funding will probably not lose much the UCP much support as few students probably voted for them anyways, but cuts to things like municipal funding and seniors drug benefits will affect many people who may have voted UCP. Of course the UCP will try go around saying there are no tax increases, but that message will not go over well for people buying cigarettes, vaping, using Air B&B or people who notice our personal provincial tax credits are no longer indexed. Some of the cuts to Arts and Culture funding come in by my calculation around 30%. Again, not a constituency that was probably a big source of votes for the UCP, but one that will now be very angry, probably very vocal, very motivated, has the potential to organize and get its message out. The disproportionate size of the cuts may help get them more public sympathy than they would otherwise, if it were say only 5%.

Mr. Klein had so many advantages when he made his cuts in the 1990’s. First, he had years of prior experience in managing a large municipal government along with its budget and finances, so I think he understood the relationship between government finances and the political side fairly well. Mr. Kenney while he was a part of Harper’s government, was for whatever reasons mostly kept out of the key economic portfolios and was in the sidecar pursuing votes from the multicultural community and keeping social conservatives happy. Second, Klein had very good timing. When he became Premier, a recession had just ended and shortly after natural gas prices started to rise a lot, increasing royalties considerably so he was able to ease off on the initial pain and still balance the budget faster than expected. Third, I think Klein was also elected on a much clearer mandate for cuts and more of a multi party consensus existed in Alberta for cuts at that time.

Mr. Kenney’s list of political enemies is already dangerously long, including environmentalists and now the Federal government. It is going to grow considerably after this budget and Alberta already has an opposition party that is large enough and experienced enough to also be a formidable and effective opponent. It does not seem like the economy is co-operating so far for Kenney, with oil prices languishing and the spectre of an international recession on the horizon, at the end of a long economic expansion. I am sure the political calculations were very carefully made to try not to anger too many people too much, but in his zeal to cut Mr. Kenney may be closer to the tipping point than he realizes and while the mobilization of all his opponents may not on its own stop him, it will not take too much bad economic news to possibly push him over the edge and I expect there could be some of that.

Dave: There are things you need to be made aware of. When Laurence Decore was mayor of Edmonton, from 1980 – 1989, he managed to reduce Edmonton’s debt by 3/4. Contrast this with Ralph Klein, when he was mayor of Calgary, from 1980 – 1989. Ralph Klein left Calgary with the largest debt it ever had up to that point, leaving a debt of nearly $1.5 billion. There was no advantages to Ralph Klein’s cutbacks. We are still feeling the effects of those cutbacks today. Actually, Don Getty said that he started the austerity, but Ralph Klein magnified them greatly. There is no advantages to laying off very large amounts of nurses and teachers. Also, there is no advantages to disregarding infrastructure upkeep. We still see infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Ralph Klein did not balance any budget. People have to stop believing that lie that Ralph Klein fed them. Ralph Klein understood nothing in relation to being fiscally responsible. The only thing Ralph Klein understood was being an arrogant drunk. These cuts by the UCP, include passing on infrastructure maintenance to municipalities. They will have to increase property taxes to make up for this. This will be felt very quickly. Students paying more for post secondary education will feel the crunch very quickly. Seniors and the lower income earners will feel the impacts of this ill planned UCP budget very quickly. The UCP’s corporate tax cuts have already cost Alberta $4.5 billion. This UCP budget has over $9 billion in losses. That’s close to $15 billion lost. People did not think when they voted in the UCP. The UCP won by fraudulent means, is more like it. There are no more oil booms, and that’s a fact. This UCP budget will not impact the wealthy, but others will feel it. Anyone with even the slightest bit of common sense would know that the cuts that Don Getty started, and that Ralph Klein exponentially increased, would not be needed, if they were not bogged down by their love of doing the most costliest scandals Canada has ever seen, and then lying and saying they never did anything wrong. Austerity is a neoliberal philosiphy, which the Fraser Institute and the Manning Centre supports, because it leads to private for profit schemes, which they love to support, which is corporate welfare. The Fraser Institute and the Manning Centre also love other failed neoliberal policies like deregulation and the flat tax, which are two of Ralph Klein’s other very costly failures. With the UCP, Albertans were duped into thinking they had something good. Jason Kenney is a fraud, a liar and a cheater. He said the UCP would not engage in Ralph Klein style cuts. We have them with this failed UCP budget. Jason Kenney became Alberta’s premier by questionable means. The R.C.M.P are still investigating him for election related infractions. If Peter Lougheed were still around, he would be totally disgusted by the UCP’s stupid and foolish antics. The Alberta PCs, other than Peter Lougheed’s government, never did anything right. The Wildrose were copycats of that. The UCP is not doing anything right either.

Even Lorne Gunter is skeptical:
“Yet Toews’ balanced budget plan still relies on revenues from income taxes rising almost 20 per cent over the next four years. Corporate tax revenues rising by nearly 30 per cent, resource revenues by 32 per cent and even transfers from Ottawa by six.

That’s a smaller gamble than the NDP were making, but it’s still a gamble especially given the potential damage a Trudeau re-election could do to energy investment and pipeline construction.

Yet at the same time, the UCP have undersold the austerity contained in their budget.

Kenney and Toews have both gone out of their way to reassure Albertans that this is not a Klein-era budget. And in terms of big, showy cuts it’s not.

On the surface, this budget contains a less than three per cent cut in spending over four years versus the 18 per cent cut in Ralph Klein’s first three budgets.

However, if the UCP are able to follow their spending plans (there’s that “trust us” – again), after accounting for inflation and population growth this budget will amount to a spending cut of nearly 14 per cent between now and 2023.

Kenney and Toews clearly know this, yet have downplayed the depth of their cuts in an attempt to win broader support for their ‘moderate’ approach.”

Of course it should noted that Kenney is already planning his departure from Alberta’s hell-scape.

There’s no doubt that Scheer will be gone before the expected leadership review. The party will give him the honour of showing off in the H of C, but the fix is already in. Scheer will resign sometime before April and avoid the scene of being frog marched out of the leadership. His end is nigh.

As for likely successors, rumours that Peter McKay (He of the military helicopter fishing trips and sleeping on Condoleezza Rice’s floor.) have been quashed as the Alberta so-cons would rebel. (And he married an Iranian woman, so racism, too.) This leaves Kenney to plot his vainglorious return to the federal scene. Once the party accepts the formula of ‘one member one vote’, with the vast majority of party membership in Alberta, Kenney’s resurrection is assured.

I wouldn’t be surprised Kenney is planning a return to Ottawa. Alberta will be a really tough slog over the next few years, with not much economic recovery in sight and I think he has always had higher ambitions anyways.

Personally, I think the Conservatives would do better in the GTA with McKay, whatever his past foibles are. Maybe its time for a leader that is not from AB or Sask. They should also give up their anti carbon tax rhetoric too, that is not going to sell very well outside the west or anywhere in the world increasingly concerned about climate change. I doubt they will do either though, so Kenney has a good chance of getting back to Ottawa as Conservative leader.

The number that stuck out to me is the accumulated debt in 2023-2024 as was projected by the former NDP government and by the present UCP government. The NDP projected a $100 billion deficit and the UCP project I believe a$93 billion deficit. Both are way too high. Alberta governments since the early 2000’s have done an extremely poor job of budgeting. I could go through each failing of the UCP’s budget but that would be pointless. In the end this budget downloads onto municipalities, increases costs to Albertan’s and does very little to balance the budget. Unfortunately Albertan’s refuse to entertain the imposition of a sales tax, even Rachel Notley refused to look at what is a more stable and economically friendly way of funding government services. Enjoy your day.

Surely you mean debt, not deficit. Even I, tax-and-spend liberal that I am, would reckon a $100-billion deficit was a little too high. DJC

I apologize for the second post on this topic but by the time Albertan’s finally accept that we need a sales tax it will to some extent be to late. A sales tax is projected to bring in $1 billion in revenue for every 1%. So a 5% sale tax would in theory bring in $5 billion in revenue. As our debt approaches $100 this additional revenue will just cover the interest payments on our accumulated debt with a little bit left over to spend on government programs. So we will be paying more tax with really little benefit, very sad.

I completely disagree on a sales tax. A sales tax is regressive and penalized low and middle income earners disproportional. A sales tax takes proportionately more the lower the income earned. 1% of $20,000 is a bigger portion of that $20,000 than 1% of $200,000.

We need to have a negative income tax where the more income is made the higher the tax. More importantly we need to rise the corporate tax rate to at least where Ralph Klein had it in the 90s.

Gail: You do know that the Alberta PCs were thinking of implementing a P.S.T, before Alison Redford was premier of Alberta, don’t you? Also, the Alberta PCs put in taxes of various sorts. Taxes on alcohol, taxes on cigarettes, taxes on beverage container purchases, taxes on motel stays in Alberta, with health care premiums in Alberta, with VLTs, (a regressive type of tax), with electronic purchases in Alberta, and with a carbon tax that Ed Stelmach put in, (Jason Kenney did not get rid of Alberta’s carbon tax, because we still have it). Where did all this money go?

Gail a couple of thoughts in relation to corporate tax rates. In 2000 Alberta’s corporate tax rate was 15.5%. In the 2000-2001 budget year Alberta generated $2.023 billion in corporate tax revenue. Alberta also recieved $7.2 billion in royalty revenue from natural gas(natural gas prices were much higher then then they are now), $1.5 billion from crude oil and $712 million from bitumen. If we move forward to the 2013-2014 budget year at a 10% corporate tax rate Alberta recieved $5.488 billion in corporate tax revenue, in the 2014-2015 budget year corporate tax revenue was $5.796 billion. Oil prices started to drop in the last half of 2014. In the first year of Premier Notley’s tenure in 2015-2016 the corporate tax rate was raised to 12%. Corporate taxes brought in $4.195 in that budget year. In 2016-2017 budget year there was $3.769 billion in corporate tax revenue. In 2017-2018 budget year there was $3.448 billion in corporate tax revenue. It climbed back to $4.871 billion in the 2018-2019 budget year. The point of all these number is that higher corporate tax rates don’t always increase revenue. No doubt Alberta’s economy was smaller in the 2000-2001 budget year. But Rachel Notley’s higher tax rate never produced as much corporate tax revenue at 12% as the previous 10% rate under the former P.C. Government due to the economic conditions in Alberta. Every province in Canada has a sales tax except Alberta. Are lower income families doing worse in other provinces than those in Alberta? Not to my knowledge. It always amazes me that those who support the NDP are so against a sales tax and at the same time think that the job creators in business are the ones who should be taxed higher to fund government. Enjoy your day.

Farmer B: the point of higher corporate income tax rates, aside from the fact it is the corporate sector that has all the money, is that it gives a corporation an incentive to avoid income tax by investing in better machinery and equipment and hiring more people (all a write off from income tax) rather than sending it to shareholders in Zurich and Houston. This enhances productivity and increases aggregate demand in the economy, especially in a resource based economy like Alberta where the resources are not movable.

There is no point taxing poor people, they have no money and it is not cost-efficient.

Kang you might inspire corporations to invest in people and equipment or they might just sell their assets and leave. Since 2015 7 multinational corporations have sold their oil sands assets and left. They include Statoil, Koch Industries, Imperial oil, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil and Royal Dutch Shell. Now no doubt this has as much to do with the price of oil as it does regulatory changes and lack of new export capacity but there is certainly a risk if you push taxes to high. Now in the UCP’s case, lowering corporate taxes in my opinion will be of little benefit, companies have left and in my opinion they are not coming back. Enjoy your day.

Farmer B: Sell their assets and leave? Good riddance. The magic of the market is somebody will buy those assets at a reduced cost base which may allow them to make a profit. There will still be revenue and jobs to tax. The tar will always have some value. It was not so long ago that Alberta was the envy of the world with the three integrated tar plants that we have and that are still exceptionally profitable.

From a jobs perspective, the fly in the ointment is automation, which as a farmer you have seen the effect of over the past 20 years. The urbans and the oil types are just at the beginning of seeing what automation means. That is why income taxation, rather than asset taxation is so important – especially to the viability of the farm community, but also to the wider community.

Alberta can disappoint people sometimes, and this is one of those cases. I hope that this won’t happen again, and the people who were involved in this have gotten the punishment that they deserve.

47,David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog,Federal election results show why abandoning ‘social license’ was a dumb idea for Alberta’s oilpatch,2019-10-27 00:46:00,David Climenhaga,,"Seeking “social license” for Alberta’s fossil fuel industry was said by the NDP government of former premier Rachel Notley to be a way to win approval for more pipeline capacity to Canada’s ocean ports.

This was true enough as far as it went, and the idea getting such approval required environment-friendly compromises like carbon taxes and emissions caps clearly succeeded. After all, despite an iffy business case, the multi-billion-dollar Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Program not only got federal approval on Ms. Notley’s watch, but was eventually temporarily nationalized by Ottawa to ensure construction could proceed.

Now, however, it is becoming clear that social license is not only essential to sustaining and even expanding Alberta’s oilsands industry, it may be key to ensuring its survival as a viable economic activity.

If so, it wasn’t very good news for the future of the oilpatch last April when Albertans elected a government that rejects the entire concept of seeking social license, is mired deep in nonsensical conspiracy theories about how opponents of expanding bitumen mining and processing in northern Alberta are financed, and is deeply committed to a belligerent approach to other provinces on the pipeline file.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

As we poke into the entrails of last week’s federal election, one thing that becomes obvious is that support in Canada for strong action on climate change is approaching a national consensus outside the Prairies.

Despite the reduction of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals to minority status — which poor Andrew Scheer insists means the government will soon fall as he hangs on by his fingernails to his job as Opposition leader and the nice house that goes with it — about two thirds of Canadians voted for parties that advocate a carbon tax.

Not only has support for climate action been growing among Canadian voters, it’s hard to believe the trend line won’t continue upward as the reality of global warming becomes more obvious in Canada and elsewhere in the world.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

That being the case, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s strategy of yelling at clouds, bullying other provinces, encouraging “Wexit” nuts, pursuing doomed constitutional challenges of the federal carbon tax with his fellow stooges in Saskatchewan and Ontario, and using his influence as a former federal cabinet minister to push the federal Conservatives to adopt the same foolish tactics is not going to improve the industry’s prospects.

Indeed, it’s clear that it’s slowly dawning in the boardrooms of the fossil fuel industry’s largest corporations that Ms. Notley’s approach wasn’t such a bad idea even if organizations like the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers are still prepared to act as Mr. Kenney’s political storm troopers.


Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe (Photo: Halsigne14, Creative Commons).

Alberta Conservatives keep repeating, as Mr. Kenney said yesterday while tweeting a link to a Fraser Institute screed, that “the Trans Mountain Pipeline has support from a clear majority of Canadians, including British Columbians.” That was true, thanks to Ms. Notley’s persuasive efforts, and perhaps it still is. But has there been any recent polling on the topic since Mr. Kenney applied his reverse Midas touch to the issue — other than the federal election, that is?


Federal Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer (Photo: Flickr/Andrew Scheer).

As for the hapless Mr. Scheer — now facing the possibility unusual since he became Speaker of the House of Commons in 2011 of losing his taxpayer subsidized housing — he is in big trouble for foolishly acting on Mr. Kenny’s view that what worked with voters in Alberta and Saskatchewan would work in other provinces too.


Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister (Photo: Flickr/Canada Games).

After Mr. Trudeau’s dismal performance of the past year, the election was Mr. Scheer’s to lose. Thanks in large part to his adoption of the Kenney strategy of saying to hell with social license, lose it he did.

Despite suggestions to the contrary by the Trumpist rump at Postmedia, the federal Conservatives were probably right to minimize the damage Ontario Premier Doug Ford could do by locking him in a back room for most of the federal campaign. The evidence now suggests they probably should have locked Mr. Kenney in a closet too while they were at it.


Ontario Premier Doug Ford (Photo: Flickr/Andrew Scheer).

Certainly, as my colleague Dave Cournoyer’s number crunching shows, Mr. Kenney’s campaigning in Ontario did Mr. Scheer little good. Only two of the 24 Conservative candidates Mr. Kenney acknowledged campaigning for in his native province won, and Conservative vote totals in 23 of the 24 ridings fell from the previous election.

Meanwhile, it appears the pre-election consensus among Conservative premiers to reject any effective action on climate change is fraying.

While Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, Mr. Kenney and Mr. Ford — the Moe, Larry and Curly of Canadian first ministers — pursue their constitutional challenge of Ottawa’s right to impose taxes, a courtroom loser if ever there was one, New Brunswick’s Blaine Higgs had already jumped ship and Manitoba’s Brian Pallister sounds as if he’s pondering abandoning ship.

If Mr. Kenney is serious about helping Alberta’s fossil fuel industry, he’ll need to dump controversial blogger Vivian Krause like the International Association of Business Communicators just did and adopt Ms. Notley’s social license strategy.

This seems unlikely just now, since by all appearances Alberta’s United Conservative Party premier still has his eye on Mr. Scheer’s job, and after that Mr. Trudeau’s. So he won’t quit attacking anything and everything Mr. Trudeau says and does any time soon.

Still, stranger things have happened. Despite all his talk, Mr. Kenney opted for a bigger deficit than the one projected by the NDP in his government’s budget last week. So you can’t rule a flip-flop out completely, especially if the biggest bosses of the energy industry have a frank chat with him.

Whatever else he is, Mr. Kenney’s not a dummy, and sooner or later reality may sink in.

Alison Redford’s back, and she wants to help!


Former Alberta premier Alison Redford (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

I note with interest that Alison Redford, who back in the day was the most unpopular politician in Alberta, seems to be trying to stage a comeback.

On Friday, she was on CBC Radio, praising the UCP’s destructive austerity budget to the rafters to rolled eyes all round. Yesterday, thanks to CTV, we learned she’s ready and willing to “lend a hand to the Trudeau Liberals to mend the relationship between Ottawa and the West.”

But has there been any recent polling on the topic since Mr. Kenney applied his reverse Midas touch to the issue — other than the federal election, that is?</p>

<p class=""p1"">After Mr. Trudeau’s dismal performance of the past year, the election was Mr. Scheer’s to lose. Thanks in large part to his adoption of the Kenney strategy of saying to hell with social license, lose it he did.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite suggestions to the contrary by the Trumpist rump at Postmedia, the federal Conservatives were probably right to minimize the damage Ontario Premier Doug Ford could do by locking him in a back room for most of the federal campaign.

Only two of the 24 Conservative candidates Mr. Kenney acknowledged campaigning for in his native province won, and Conservative vote totals in 23 of the 24 ridings fell from the previous election.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Meanwhile, it appears the pre-election consensus among Conservative premiers to reject any effective action on climate change is fraying.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, Mr. Kenney and Mr. Ford — the Moe, Larry and Curly of Canadian first ministers — pursue their constitutional challenge of Ottawa’s right to impose taxes, a courtroom loser if ever there was one, New Brunswick’s <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-carbon-tax-higgs-trudeau-1.5332588"">Blaine Higgs had already jumped ship</a> and Manitoba’s <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/brian-pallister-carbon-tax-opposition-election-1.5331216"">Brian Pallister sounds</a> as if he’s pondering abandoning ship.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If Mr. Kenney is serious about helping Alberta’s fossil fuel industry, he’ll need to dump controversial blogger Vivian Krause l<a href=""https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2019/10/25/vivian-krause-dropped-as-keynote-speaker-at-business-communications-conference.html"">ike the International Association of Business Communicators just did</a> and adopt Ms. Notley’s social license strategy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This seems unlikely just now, since by all appearances Alberta’s United Conservative Party premier still has his eye on Mr. Scheer’s job, and after that Mr. Trudeau’s. So he won’t quit attacking anything and everything Mr. Trudeau says and does any time soon.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, stranger things have happened. Despite all his talk, Mr. Kenney opted for a bigger deficit than the one projected by the NDP in his government’s budget last week.

Thank you David for pointing out that Alison Redford is weaseling around for more taxpayer money. The last time we let her anywhere near the purse strings was a disaster and she was lucky to only suffer public humiliation rather than an investigation into her flagrant abuse of public funds.

You know, if you read those demanding letters to PM Trudeau from Jason Kenney and his political sidekick, Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, you’ll rapidly realize that there isn’t a snowball’s chance in Hades that Mr Trudeau will honour any of their demands. They’re just the ravings of a spoiled child, angry they didn’t get their way.

On climate change and pricing carbon, Mr Trudeau’s Liberals would face universal opposition from the NDP, the Greens, and Bloc if they were to backpedal on this plan — indeed, before and during the election campaign they had already faced intense criticism from both Singh and May on the timidity of their current plan. Why should they risk this by kowtowing to the premiers of Alberta and Saskatchewan, when the likelihood it’d gain them anything next election is vanishingly small?

Their letters also demand progress on the Trans-Mountain pipeline expansion project. Well, the Liberals bought the damned thing, and unless the newest court challenges once again put a halt on it, construction is expected to ramp up in the New Year after the winter slowdown. I’m not sure what else Messrs Moe and Kenney want from the feds on this; if the NDP and Greens had their way the new Trudeau government would put a stop to it, but I don’t think they’ll do that. I think the Liberals will accept the opprobrium from their left, and from the Bloc Québécois — because of their views on provincial jurisdiction and how the precedent of overriding the objections of BC might affect Quebec’s jurisdictional authority — since there is little likelihood the Conservatives would allow the government to fall because of this issue: that would be completely counterproductive from their perspective.

Both Moe and Kenney also made demands on equalization. I looked at the NDP’s and Greens’ web pages, to see if they have existing policy on this. I couldn’t find any mention of equalization on the NDP’s page, and typing the word into the search bar yielded zero results. The Greens do have an old 2015 pre-election policy backgrounder on the topic at https://www.greenparty.ca/en/policy-background-2015/part-b, but there was no mention of this matter in their 2019 platform that I could find. You can also certainly expect a major pushback from the Bloc on revisiting equalization.

Mr Kenney and Mr Moe — as well as Mr Scheer — claim that the voters sent the Trudeau Liberals a message. Yes, they did, but not the message they think was sent. Outside of the Saskaberta bubble, the message was “don’t you dare back down on protecting the environment” or else. Alberta and Saskatchewan need to figure out how to get on board with the rest of the country on this, in a way that better balances credible climate action with maintaining a productive economy and employment — oh, wait, isn’t that exactly what the Notley government tried to do? Look what that got them. #smh

Climenhaga: “…it wasn’t very good news for the future of the oilpatch last April when Albertans elected a government that rejects the entire concept of seeking social license, is mired deep in nonsensical conspiracy theories about how opponents of expanding bitumen mining and processing in northern Alberta are financed, and is deeply committed to a belligerent approach to other provinces on the pipeline file.”

The NDP introduced and passed Bill 12 — the turn-off-the-taps legislation.

Both the NDP and UCP reject the science on climate change and its implications for fossil fuel development.

Notley also bought into conspiracy theorist Vivian Krause’s absurd conspiracy theories:
Vivian Krause: “I have been working since July 2018 with Notley’s govt to provide information and assist her team in taking the necessary steps to break the pipeline gridlock.”
• https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/vivian-krause-rachel-notley-the-rockefellers-and-albertas-landlocked-oil

“‘I’m frustrated by it, of course,’ Notley says of the [anti-oilsands] campaign. ‘Vivian Krause (the B.C. researcher) and people like her have done a good job of really laying bare the details of this and really showing us the degree to which this had been going on and building over time.'”

Once AB NDP Premier Rachel Notley endorsed Krause’s wacky theories, it was no longer right-wing and no longer conspiracy theory. Notley took it mainstream.

A popular new strategy is fast emerging in the fight to turn the tables on vacillating fossil fuel companies and stubborn governments who refuse to take serious action on climate change.

It’s happening in the U.S. with regularity and it’s starting to happen in Canada. Lawsuits against governments and oil and gas companies may be the only remedy left in the war on anthropogenic greenhouse gases and to get obstinate and climate change denying entities on board to support full-blown consequential climate mitigation initiatives.

Sooner or later, every well trained dog is taught how to sit, speak, and roll over on command. So it seems to be with the compliant political salesmen acting as revolving door lobbyists for their friends in industry. Eventually, such under qualified individuals may even be asked to take a position on the board of directors, because friends and family look out for each other and because right thinking is sure to be rewarded, whereas; wrong thinking is sure to be punished, economically, or otherwise. In this case, the obvious appears to be just what it seems:

It probably wasn’t a bad idea to hide Mr. Ford away for most of the duration of the campaign, although it was too obvious and so heavy handed even I felt a bit sorry how Ford was badly man handled by the bigger blue machine. If this is how they treat their friends, how do they treat everyone else? However, it obviously wasn’t a great idea to bring in Premier Kenney recently of Alberta Uber Alles to try persuade the persuadable folks of the GTA. It seemed to scare them back to the Liberals.

I have a feeling the Conservatives will do something right and something wrong after they reflect on what election results mean for them. First, I think they will get rid of the hapless Scheer, which is the right move. Second I think they will replace him with someone like Kenney or perhaps the original himself.

Mr. Scheer didn’t lose the election because of his mishaps with his insurance licence or dual US citizenship, although they sure didn’t help him. He lost because he couldn’t sell things like the conservative climate non action plan to Canadians not buying it. The Conservatives will probably conclude they need a better salesman, like Kenney, but what they really need is a better product.

I agree: the CPC brand is way past its shelf life. And it’s a long way back to the fork in the road it missed. I wish habitual conservative-voting citizens would shake off the retrograde fantasy of returning to an heroic age and embrace the meaning of the word “conservative” as applied to the environment. Problem is, the CPC is an imposter that keeps ginning the ultra-traditional, evangelical tropes in the two Prairie Provinces. I’m not sure the CPC is redeemable—just wish a renewed Tory party would appear—I think it would really appeal to moderate conservatives.

I think Big Bitumen really does want to retreat: the tanking of diluted bitumen prices, Kinder Morgan’s ditching of the Transmountain dog, and the layoff of thousands of bitumen workers being the first clues; Premier Notley’s decrease of dilbit production, ostensibly to boost prices by dearth of supply, was also a convenient screen for Big B to exploit in its disguised retreat: the jig is up and they know it. But they have to do it in good order else the write-down of considerable capital assets proceed too quickly—as in, rout. Thus they may tacitly approve of the NDP’s prescription, but are compelled to demonstrate fealty to the Little King of the Bitumen Mines of Albetar for their shareholders’ sakes.

More Canadian voters are acknowledging the challenges of climate-change and fossil fuels as a major contributor to it. However, it’s also getting easier for them to separate Alberta’s particularly dirty brand of what the UCP calls “ethical oil” from the refined, “unethical” oil whence the fuel most of them still burn in their personal automobiles; in GHG terms, there’s no contest: because Big B must burn petro-fuels to smelt bitumen from the sandy matrix in which it is found, the up-front GHG is necessarily higher than sweet crude which flows itself out of the Arabian sands in pure form, ready to ship anywhere, as- is (it’s subsequent refining is also much less expensive than dilbit which is the lowest grade of petroleum next to asphalt). It’s one thing to garner unquestioned loyalty from bitumen workers in Alberta, quite another to garner electoral support on these grounds from the ROC+Q: this is the election’s grim test result, suspicion now confirmed.

Not sure if Scheer’s presumption that the electorate would side with the bitumen provinces was purely “foolish.” Although polls consistently showed the CPC as sub-majority and only on the cusp of minority potential, it was a shot he would have been irresponsible as party leader not to take, and JT was really the only chink in which he could bend his pry bar—the Quebec “separatist threat” so successfully leveraged by the original destroyers of the Progressive Conservative hegemony not yet so apparent during CPC’s 2019 campaign planning (also not sure how the “my-separatism’s-better-than-your-separatism” will play for future conservative leaders—already conservative premiers from the former-colonial provinces are distancing themselves from this kind of contest).

Given there’s virtual CPC seat-count parity between the two former-charter, ‘spare-cloth’ provinces and the old province of Canada (Upper and Lower), 47 to 46, respectively, it’s still possible for the next CPC leader to extricate the party from UCP-SP “national-unity-crisis” rhetoric. Jason KeKangaroo Kenney might have something to say about that, though, those two provinces being essential for any federal return he might be contemplating. With pseudoCondom in general retreat all over the Western World and the likelihood that our current minority government will probably perform better in Canadians’ estimation, courtesy of NDP tempering, the KeKangaroo —who’s no dummy, as DJC correctly notes—will need to temper his own separatist, “take-my-bitumen-bat-and-ball-and-go-home” rhetoric, among other important and essential steps in preparation for the jump, before entertaining any federal revival of this currently moribund movement.

But it’s true: Kenney left Scheer no option but to adopt what astute pundits recognized as a losing campaign strategy. In fact, many an astute pundit has speculated that, given the impossible numbers, it was always the KeKangaroo’s plan to let Scheer fail so’s to run for CPC leadership himself, thence for Prime Ministership. Naturally the required disingenuousness and narratological contortions will be fascinating to behold. I have my doubts anything will work, though, at least not for many years after the D’ohFo has been un-elected in vote-rich Ontario: KeKenney will have to come out of the closet to stump his rump in the Upper Canadian farm belt. Will he apply his bitumen rhetoric to Petrolia where the jerk-line shackles and crimps are still wrought by hand (still the commercial source of some of the sweetest crude in the world, it is, however, at the opposite end of production aspiration as bitumen mining is; I suspect KeKenney would pretend it doesn’t exist at all).

I think even TMX-approving Canadians will, in the unfolding circumstances, be copacetic with the twinned pipeline simply replacing what the existing TM line does—JT has plenty of reasons to sandbag (I was almost gonna make a pun…but, no…), this obvious ‘out’ being one: at least the now-public enterprise continues to generate revenues without having to increase supertanker dilbit shipping seven fold as the UCP and CPC say they must happen (‘or else’…). I still can’t help but notice the many superior features of a Prince Rupert dilbit export terminus—there are so many that I almost missed the fact that such a route would pass through and benefit BC’s little piece of the Great Plains which currently adopts Alberta’s separatist sabre rattling as if fully irredentist, a fact not missed by provincial and federal politicians who’d like to relive the CPC (and the BC Liberals, provincially) of these seats by way of nonCon government largess. A pipeline would blunt rising discontent from this remote corner of BC which, until the LNG pipeline and terminus in Kitimat (the destination of Harper’s shit-canned Northern Gateway Pipeline) is completed, is beholden to the sole market of the bitumen mines to which it supplies gas for smelting operations—at ‘discounted prices’, no doubt.

Having a hard time with the Three Stooges comparison. KeKenney acts more like Moe Howard to me than Scott Moe does; the D’ohfo, though, does an excellent Curly (leaving Scott Moe the role of Larry, that Stooge of perennial peevishness).

It really is interesting that Alison Redford has unleashed a trial skunk upon the picnic of prairie pugnacity. A conservative Notley, perhaps? Nobody ever said she wasn’t smart—as diplomat, that is, not so much as a politician. But it doesn’t take too much smarts to sniff around the prospect of the premiership soon being abandoned to another leadership race, this time for the UCP —at least at the corners.

In light of the negative impacts the world is already experiencing a ~1 degree C, the IPCC forecast of 3 degrees C by 2100 and their proven record of underestimating the rate of change and risks, we can be certain that bitumen mining will not be happening in 2090, nor will life as we know it.

The truly amazing thing about all this is that Jason Kenney actually believes he’s defending Alberta’s O&G industry from a position of strength, the absence of social licence notwithstanding. The major producers were reticent about Kenney’s obsession with killing Alberta’s carbon-tax, and told him so on more than a few occasions. Then Kenney started threatening the industry. It’s apparent that Kenney’s hopes of entering the PMO rested on pursuing foolish policies that appealed to those thoughtless enough to believe his nonsense. More thoughtful interests knew better, but whatever.

So, mighty Jason Kenney stands alone as the so called “Resistance”. Doug Ford is already talking about reconciliation with Trudeau; Blaine and Palliser are talking about their own carbon levies; and Scott Moe, though seemingly joining the Wexit bandwagon, knows he has his own election coming up – voters are likely to frown on Moe joining in on Kenny’s crazy.

Kenney’s talking tough, but Trudeau in solid for the next four years, thanks to the NDP and the BQ. Kenny’s crazy is only going to get hotter.

Well, whatever. It’s not as if this comes as a big surprise.


Alberta Premier Jason Kenney (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

What was going to happen was predetermined weeks ago and was predicted here and elsewhere repeatedly ever since the government appointed a panel led by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon, whose op-ed calling for legislated wage rollbacks for public employees was published two years ago this week, to look into the state of the province’s finances.

When public sector unions’ wage arbitrations are allowed to resume after tomorrow’s Halloween celebrations are over, Mr. Toews explained in the government’s press release yesterday, there will be “an updated monetary mandate” that “moves from the previous position of no increase for 2019 to an average 2-per-cent reduction for collective agreements that include a 2019 wage reopener.”

Regardless of the recommendations of the MacKinnon Panel or the law the UCP passed to suspend arbitrations last spring until the panel reported, there’s a technical term for this sort of thing in labour relations, and it’s not trick or treat. It’s called bargaining in bad faith. It’s illegal.


Alberta Union of Provincial Employees President Guy Smith (Photo: David J. Climenhaga).

What’s more, none of the public sector health care unions affected by this planned rollback are negotiating with the government of Alberta. They’re negotiating with Alberta Health Services and other health care employers. AHS is supposedly an arm’s length agency.

The day before yesterday the Kenney Government introduced omnibus budget legislation that among many other things is intended to allow it to impose many terms and conditions on supposedly freely negotiated collective agreements between public sector unions and government agencies.

As noted in this space at the time, this essentially ended the process of free collective bargaining right there. So there’s a strong argument to be made that part of Bill 21 is unconstitutional, and legal challenges with a significant probability of success are a virtual certainty.

So one of the weird things about Mr. Toews’s announcement yesterday was the fact it was made before Bill 21 had even been passed by the Legislature, let alone enacted into law.


United Nurses of Alberta President Heather Smith (Photo: David Cournoyer/UNA).

While the government will soon have given itself the power to secretly order supposedly independent employer negotiators to take positions in bargaining, it’s less clear this means arbitrators will be willing to break the law and allow those employers to roll back accepted bargaining positions on the government’s say so.

If a courageous arbitrator takes note of the fact Alberta Health Services is sitting on a $1.3-billion surplus or that Alberta’s wages are consistently the highest in the country and says no to the government’s channeled demands, the government could pass legislation to roll public employees wages back anyway.

But since there would have to be done with no meaningful consultation with the affected unions by the government, that too might run afoul of Canada’s courts — which remain, despite the authoritarian tendencies of Alberta’s United Conservative Party Government, independent and impartial.

After that, there’s always the Notwithstanding Clause.

Still, perhaps as Alberta Union of Provincial Employees President Guy Smith suggested to the Edmonton Journal yesterday, the announcement was just a way of bargaining in the media.

Certainly it seems to be being done without the level of attention to the market one would have expected from a normally market-fundamentalist government like the UCP. As United Nurses of Alberta President Heather Smith observed yesterday afternoon, the worldwide market for the services provided by the 30,000 Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses her union represents remains strong, and there is already a shortage of RNs in Alberta. So the 3-per-cent pay cut the government wants to impose on UNA members also makes no sense from that standpoint either.

In addition to nurses, workers affected by the planned rollbacks will include teachers, social workers, health care support staff, paramedics, medical technical professionals, and guards in provincial jails. It’s not hard to predict how those workers will react to yesterday’s announcement.

After a four-year respite, it certainly looks as if the days of perpetual chaos in Alberta’s health care system that characterized the final years of the province’s PC era are about to return with a vengeance.

Taken together, this policy and the way it was announced suggests a level of entitlement and contempt for the rule of law on the part of Premier Jason Kenney’s government that considerably surpasses that of the old Progressive Conservative Party even after it had been in power for nearly 44 years!

The new green, somewhat like the old green

After campaigning bitterly against the NDP’s carbon tax in last spring’s provincial and the Trudeau version in the Oct. 21 federal vote, the UCP introduced legislation yesterday to keep significant parts of of the NDP’s policy in place.

The real reason appears to be the realization a smidgen of realpolitik is better than handing over millions of dollars to a Liberal government Ottawa. Still, Environment Minister Jason Nixon did his best to pass off the partial climb-down as “standing up for Alberta’s job creators, like oil and gas.”

Critics called the new system unfair and inefficient, punishing companies that have tried to reduce emissions and letting those that haven’t bothered off the hook. Nevertheless, this seems like a significant flip-flop by the UCP on carbon taxes.

Presumably the government kept this policy in a drawer in hopes that federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer would have soon been in a position to dismantle Ottawa’s carbon tax. Had that happened, it’s safe to assume the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction Implementation Act would never have seen the light of day","<div class=""entry-contentinside"">

<p class=""p1"">Well, whatever. It’s not as if this comes as a big surprise.</p>

<p class=""p1"">What was going to happen was predetermined weeks ago and was predicted here and elsewhere repeatedly ever since the government appointed a panel led by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon, whose op-ed calling for legislated wage rollbacks for public employees was published two years ago this week, to look into the state of the province’s finances.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When public sector unions’ wage arbitrations are allowed to resume after tomorrow’s Halloween celebrations are over, Mr. Toews explained in the government’s press release yesterday, there will be “an updated monetary mandate” that “moves from the previous position of no increase for 2019 to an average 2-per-cent reduction for collective agreements that include a 2019 wage reopener.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">Regardless of the recommendations of the MacKinnon Panel or the law the UCP passed to suspend arbitrations last spring until the panel reported, there’s a technical term for this sort of thing in labour relations, and it’s not <i>trick or treat</i>. It’s called <i>bargaining in bad faith</i>. It’s illegal.</p>

<p class=""p1"">What’s more, none of the public sector health care unions affected by this planned rollback are negotiating with the government of Alberta. They’re negotiating with Alberta Health Services and other health care employers. AHS is supposedly an arm’s length agency.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The day before yesterday the Kenney Government <a href=""https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/10/are-secret-mandatory-government-bargaining-orders-the-new-face-of-public-sector-labour-relations-in-alberta/"">introduced omnibus budget legislation</a> that among many other things is intended to allow it to impose many terms and conditions on supposedly freely negotiated collective agreements between public sector unions and government agencies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As noted in this space at the time, this essentially ended the process of free collective bargaining right there. So there’s a strong argument to be made that part of Bill 21 is unconstitutional, and legal challenges with a significant probability of success are a virtual certainty.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So one of the weird things about Mr. Toews’s announcement yesterday was the fact it was made <i>before</i> Bill 21 had even been passed by the Legislature, let alone enacted into law.</p>

It’s not enough for Kenney that 2,000 people lose their jobs. The ones left behind who watch their friends and colleagues suffer must now take on more work AND a pay cut. To top it all off, Kenney and his fellow ideologues take a perverse pleasure in inflicting suffering on others.

The only hope is for brave independent arbitrators and the courts to slap down Kenney’s vicious behavior.

None of the people who lose their jobs or take a pay cut have a fully-indexed $120,000 a year pension like Kenney does.

Kenney campaigned on creating jobs. What he left out was that those jobs were only for lawyers and failed UCP candidates.

Ineptitude is going to the cente of so many of this ideologically cruel government I fear for the collective blood pressure of Albertans. We will need our nurses.

This is all pretty rich coming from Jason Kenney, who is recognized as being the fourth wealthiest politician in Canada. Kenney’s personal wealth, not including his fat MP’s pension, is noted at approximately $19 million. Even the CTF noted that Kenney will receive $4.3 million upon eligibility, which he’s grandfathered in at 55 years of age. Kenney was first elected as a federal MP in 1997, so the new rules don’t apply to him. (Like most of the other rules in life.)

David, do you think that the wage rollback will also apply to the managers in public sector too.

Never let a good crisis go to waste, and if there isn’t a crisis create one. Wait until Kenney begins going after the pensions, in keeping with the theme of funneling public funds to private hands it is hard to imagine a situation where the billions in public pensions are left alone.
How does this plunder of Alberta play into Kenney’s much rumored goal of becoming the Prime Minister? Everything seems so short term he isn’t even going to balance the budget.

I would say Mr. Kenney has been a disappointment, but mostly he has done what I expected. He seems determined to cut his way to prosperity – if that ever really works. I think the real disappointment will be for those who voted for the UCP expecting a return to good times any time soon. They will be waiting .. and waiting and instead things are likely to get worse instead of better because of various UCP decisions. I suspect those voters will eventually turn on him with a vengeance, if he is foolish enough to stick around here, instead of going back to the relative political safety of Ottawa as soon as possible.

Kenney seems to operate on trying to demonize others, first the NDP and our former Premier, then Prime Minister Trudeau, environmentalists and now our public service employees. Of course none of this helps our economy, but I suppose it just gives him a way to distract Alberta voters for a while from the fact he isn’t really helping the economy.

I suspect he is also trying provoke a rash response that may be unpopular, but all his overreaching legislation could find his government tied up in the courts instead. I’m not a lawyer, but I am thinking there may be at least a dozen different cases here, related to various pieces of his omnibus budget bills.

I suspect Mr. Kenney will also go around trying to make the political argument that we are broke, which is not the case, as Mr. Kenney apparently had $4.5 billion to give in corporate tax cuts. A government that was really broke couldn’t have done that. He had his so called blue ribbon panel make selected spending comparisons with other provinces, but forbade them from looking at the revenue side. Had they looked at it, they would have advised, Alberta has the ability to raise more revenue, more so than any other province and our debt is lower than that of other provinces – so again we are not broke.

Mr. Kenney has made his choices, while trying to give the impression there were no choices, of giving out a large corporate tax cut on the questionable assumption it would result in more jobs and cut government spending to fund that. That is not restraint, it is redistribution. It is unlikely the owners of the large corporations that get this tax windfall will reinvest in our poor economy, but probably just take the money out and back home. Meanwhile the working people whose salaries and wages are cut, will reduce their spending in local businesses, making the economic situation here even worse.
