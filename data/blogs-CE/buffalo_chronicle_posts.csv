16,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Corruption scandal prompts calls on Trudeau to resign,2/12/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Justin Trudeau with his Principle Secretary Gerald Butts. Conversations between Butts and the former Attorney General regarding a government contractor are said to be the subject of audio recordings.




Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has become embroiled in scandalous allegations of public misconduct that threaten his ability to retain power over Canada’s Liberal Party government ahead of elections scheduled for later this year.

Trudeau is alleged to have pressured former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, a large government contractor that is one of the Liberal Party’s largest corporate donors. She was removed from that office less than three months after refusing to intervene in that prosecution.

The firm SNC-Lavalin was charged with money laundering, bribery, and fraud in connection with $48 million in payments to officials in Libya under Moammar Gadhafi. If convicted, the firm would be blocked from federal contracting opportunities for a decade.

Trudeau has denied improprieties but has refused to allow Wilson-Raybould, who is bound by attorney-client privilege, to speak publicly about her interactions with the Prime Minister’s Office and Trudeau’s Principle Secretary Gerald Butts, widely regarded as Trudeau’s heavy-handed political enforcer.


Wilson-Raybould is seen as the “heir apparent” Leader of the Liberal Party, in the increasingly likely event that Trudeau is forced to step aside. She represents an influential riding in the heart of Vancouver.

SNC-Lavalin had been aggressively lobbying key government officials to create a legal mechanism through which the firm could avoid criminal prosecution in exchange for a negotiated deal with prosecutors to take remedial actions, including forfeiting illicit profits and installing a new governing board. That legal mechanism was quietly inserted into the budget bill last year, giving SNC-Lavalin precisely what it had been lobbying for over the past three years.

In a conference call with investors last year, the firm’s chairman told shareholders that the firm had been lobbying for and expecting passage of the provision. The Trudeau government has touted these ‘Remedial Agreements’ as a measure that could improve compliance and corporate culture while giving prosecutors more flexibility “to secure effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for corporate wrongdoing.”

Use of such deferred prosecution agreements is at the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Last October the office informed SNC-Lavalin that no special deal was coming. Executives publicly lamented that prosecutors refused to “open negotiations” without “offering feedback”.

“Canadians owe Jody Wilson-Raybould a debt of gratitude for holding true to her principles and protecting the rule of law when her political masters implored her to abandon it,” Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer wrote in an open letter published in The National Post.

Scheer has called on Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege and wants nine key officials to testify before a Justice Committee investigation, including Butts and Trudeau’s Cheif of Staff, Katie Telford.


Andrew Scheer is vying to become Canada’s next Prime Minister.

On Monday, the Prime Minister insisted that he did not direct Wilson-Raybould to come to any particular conclusion on whether to direct the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to sign an agreement with SNC-Lavalin, but Trudeau does not deny ‘a heated debate’ inside the cabinet regarding the company.

“She confirmed for me a conversation we had this fall where I told her directly that any decisions on matters involving the director of public prosecutions were hers alone,” Trudeau said, after traveling to British Columbia to meet twice privately with Wilson-Raybould, who he demoted to Minister of Veterans Affairs late last month.

Wilson-Raybould has been tight-lipped and was absent from a press event that Trudeau had scheduled near her riding on Monday morning.

“I respect her view that, due to privilege, she can’t comment or add on matters recently before the media. I also highlight that we’re bound by cabinet confidentiality. In our system of governance, her presence in cabinet should speak for itself,” Trudeau said. “I continue to have full confidence in Jody.”

When Trudeau was asked if he would waive solicitor-client privilege to allow the former Attorney General to speak openly, Trudeau said he has asked current Attorney General David Lametti, the man he tapped to replace Wilson-Raybould, to provide advice on the matter.

He said solicitor-client privilege is “not a simple issue.”

By Tuesday morning, Trudeau told his cabinet ministers that Wilson-Raybould had resigned as Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defense, which she offered “with a heavy heart”.


David Lametti, the new Attorney General, represents a Montreal-based riding near SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters, where many of its 8,500 employees live and work. His appointment is widely seen as an effort by the Prime Minister to ensure that SNC-Lavalin will avoid criminal prosecution.

In addition, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion confirmed possible violations of the Conflict of Interest Act, including contravention of Section 9, which prohibits public office holders from trying to influence decisions that could “improperly further another person’s private interests.”

In recent days, members of the Liberal Party — including staffers of the Prime Minister — have been privately disparaging Wilson-Raybould to press outlets. Officials have offered quotes without attribution to major press outlets that accuse the Attorney General of being “difficult to work with” and “hard to trust” noting that she had four chiefs of staff in as many years, and attended merely one indigenous caucus meeting.

The view of her from outside the government is far more flattering — well known in Vancouver as exceptionally smart and exceptionally driven. Her father is a well known Kwakwaka’wakw Chief who helped get Indigenous title to land and treaty rights enshrined in the Constitution Act of 1982.

Chief Bill Wilson, once told Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, that his daughters were going to be prime ministers one day.

Wilson-Raybould leaves a significant legacy as Justice Minister and Attorney General, having spearheaded historic changes in federal law, including physician-assisted suicide and recreational marijuana. She is a former Crown prosecutor.


It’s unclear if the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff Katie Telford will be testifying before the House of Commons. She is thought by the opposition to be a central witness to the Office’s dealings with SNC-Lavalin and the Justice Ministry.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

17,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"With Liberals in crisis mode, NDP wants Wilson-Raybould as Leader",2/15/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Political staffers at the New Democratic Party (NDP) are telling Toronto-area political operatives that the opposition party is willing to install Jody Wilson-Raybould as its Leader. Toronto area politicians have been engaging in private discussions with Jagmeet Singh, the current NDP Leader, to secure his endorsement.

Wilson-Raybould has not been formally asked to join the party, but senior party figures are eagerly lobbying for the arrangement behind the scenes.

The Liberal Party was in crisis mode before the explosive allegations that Justin Trudeau removed the former Attorney General shortly after she refused to intervene in the prosecution of one of the party’s largest contributors. The scandal has engulfed his government, prompting an ethics inquiry and a Justice Committee investigation that threaten Trudeau’s ability to retain control of the Liberal Party.

The Liberal Party brand has been badly damaged under Trudeau, largely stemming from federal policies that are perceived to be hostile to middle-class Canadians. Many activists and partisans, already spooked by last year’s Provincial losses in Ontario, have begun calling for his resignation. Elections are scheduled for October 21st of this year, and diming electoral prospects are likely to intensify those calls.

Cabinet ministers have been privately discussing the possibility of holding a confidence vote that would be likely to affirm Trudeau’s leadership of the party. Finance Minister Bill Morneau supports the idea and believes that affirmation is needed to stabilize the party. Others, like Chrystia Freeland andJane Philpott, fear that a no-confidence motion would make for a humiliating blow to the Trudeau government, even if he wins it narrowly.


Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott, Seamus O’Regan, and David Lametti at the Prime Minister’s announcement of last month’s cabinet shuffle. Trudeau’s critics say that he may have fraudulently misrepresented the motivation for those reassignments to the Crown. They argue that such an offense gives the Governor-General grounds to dismiss him.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

I am not sure if JWR is the answer, but Horwath should have been replaced after the last disastrous election 4-6 years ago. At the Provincial conference, I tried my best to persuade delegates to vote for a leadership review, but they were too cowardly to do so. The most common excuses voiced were “That would require a leadership convention and might interfere with the upcoming federal election we are likely to win.” along with “I agree Andrea leaves a lot to be desired, but who will replace her?”. Personally, I f3lt any change would be for the better, but my hope was that Jagmeet Singh would take over leadership of the provincial wing.

As a result of the lack of courage on the part of delegates, Andrea was left in charge and has just blown another election. As for the federal election, I stood in the Jack Layton building and informed the pompous ass who had just admitted to the specious reason they were rejecting me as a candidate, that he was a fool and that it seemed their entire strategy for the upcoming election was based on fear of losing. I pointed out that no decision based on fear is ever a good decision, and the NDP would lose badly if they did not revise this idiotic strategy. They didn’t……..then they did lose…..badly.

18,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Scheer wants BMO and Treasury official questioned in SNC-Lavalin probe,2/19/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Former Treasury Board President Scott Brison embracing Justin Trudeau following a farewell speech delivered on February 6. Brinson abruptly resigned his cabinet post on January 10, following more than 22 years in the House of Commons, with little explanation. He was hired by BMO on February 14.




Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, wants former Treasury Board President Scott Brison and several executives at the Bank of Montreal’s investment banking division included in widely expected Senate investigations into SNC-Lavalin and the removal of Jody Wilson-Raybould as Attorney General.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said publicly that, if Brison hadn’t resigned then he wouldn’t have removed Wilson-Raybould as leader of the Justice Ministry. That logic has confused many Canadian political observers. Why would the Treasury Board President’s resignation impact the tenure of the Justice Minister?

Sources close to the Conservative opposition leader have told The Chronicle, on the condition of anonymity, that Scheer has reason to suspect that Brison’s resignation on January 10th was part of a wider effort to shield the government and Bank of Montreal executives from wide-ranging improprieties related to the former Kinder Morgan pipeline and its subsequent acquisition.

The Bank of Montreal has been using intermediary business service providers to ‘effectively bribe’ the elected officials of Indian Act-governments in British Columbia in exchange for pipeline approvals, the longtime government relations executive alleges. That practice has been a source of outrage among indigenous people in the Province.

Worried that the practice violates the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, (a conviction under that law would result in criminal prosecutions and trade sanctions against BMO), banking executives hurridly lobbied Finance Minister Bill Morneau in late May, and were able to quickly secure a transaction that would effectively nationalize the pipeline, while offering favorable terms of indemnification to the investors involved in the project.


Treasury Board President Scott Brison, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, were the chief architects of the government’s acquisition of Kinder Morgan’s pipeline in British Columbia. The transaction continues to raise eyebrows.

The source claims that Wilson-Raybould, who had just denied a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin in early-September, was similarly unwilling to offer BMO such an arrangement because the newly introduced legal mechanism did not allow for a retroactive application. Trudeau was unwilling to direct her in any official capacity, with the intention of insulating himself from political backlash.

Brison was hired by BMO by February 14th, as Vice Chairman of the firm’s investment and corporate banking business — just weeks after his abrupt resignation. Scheer is said to have evidence that Brison was offered that position privately prior to leaving the Trudeau government — and that Gerald Butts, the PM’s recently resigned Principle Secretary, was involved in arranging for the position in the firm’s Toronto office.

As President of the Treasury Board, Brison acted as the comptroller of the federal government with oversight responsibility for government payments. Scheer does not intend to make his information public until a date closer to the federal elections, scheduled for October 21st.

The improprieties threatened to become public during the Trudeau government’s re-negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which may have undermined the political posturing of Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland during her negotiations with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

BMO led an IPO of Bill Morneau’s Morneau Sobeco as an income trust in mid-2000s. The only equity analyst covering the company at the time was BMO’s.

According to Globe&Mail, Evan Siddall, CEO of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, helped broker the pipeline deal with Kinder Morgan because (a) he is a long-time friend of Bill Morneau, (b) used to be a CEO of an Cdn oil-patch company, (c) used to work for BMO (and Goldman) as investment banker.

Trudeau, Mr Dressup, went to India and gave India $750 million Canadian Taxpayer dollars. Trudeau returns to Canada. Two weeks after Trudeau the French President Marcon goes to India and goes home with a $600 million dollar Order for a new French reactor. Looks like Trudeau is creating jobs in France for Marcon his bromance buddy. But it may be possible that a little of that $750 million Canada gave India may go to SNC Lavalin for site engineering services for the French reactor. No One in Canada will investigate this angle.

19,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Wernick likely to depart the Trudeau government as RCMP probes SNC Lavalin influence,2/25/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Following intense criticism of Justice Committee testimony in the House of Commons that was widely seen as unduly partisan for Canada’s top government administrator, Michael Wernick is likely to depart his position as Clerk of the Privy Council in the next several days, sources close to Cabinet tell The Chronicle.

Wernick admitted during hearings on Thursday to pressuring — and to conspiring with others in the Trudeau government to pressure — former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to offer a ‘Deferred Prosecution Agreement’ to one of the Liberal Party’s largest contributors. Despite demands from opposition party members, Wernick did not offer his testimony under oath.

The Ottawa-based political operative inside the Trudeau government tells The Chronicle that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has reached out to Wernick to schedule questioning in the SNC-Lavalin matter. The agency is actively investigating the matter and the PMO is ‘profoundly’ worried that former Treasury Board President Scott Brison may be questioned by the RCMP next week.

An open investigation has been ongoing since SNC-Lavalin’s indictment by Swiss prosecutors in 2012. In recent days those investigators have been increasingly willing to assert the agency’s ‘independent and proper’ role, though the federal police do report to the PMO.


Jody Wilson-Raybould is the heir apparent Leader of the Liberal Party in the increasingly likely event that Justin Trudeau will be forced to resign or face charges of public corruption in his dealings with SNC Lavalin.

Despite the Justice Ministry’s conclusion that SNC Lavalin did not qualify for a ‘Deferred Prosecution Agreement’ in early September, Wernick played a key role in coordinating ‘vigorous’ months-long lobbying of the Attorney General. His objective was clear and readily admitted in his testimony: he wanted Wilson-Raybould to ignore the requirements of that law, and to direct career prosecutors to halt the criminal trial of a firm with a long history of public corruption and bribery.

Wernick also admitted that his motives, and the motives of his co-conspirators, were motivated by economic and political considerations. The deferred prosecution law specifically rejects economic and political reasoning from being considered in determining eligibility.

Wernick reports directly to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and conspired to exert pressure on Wilson-Raybould with Trudeau’s top political operatives — including former Principle Secretary Gerald Butts, Chief of Staff Katie Telford, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

But repeated meetings and phone calls were only part of the pressure campaign.

Last December Wernick is said to have ‘threatened’ Wilson-Raybould’s senior staffer, Jessica Prince, with ominous warnings regarding the Cabinet’s displeasure with the Attorney General’s decision, less than a month before she was removed as Justice Minister.

The position of Clerk of the Privy Council is a historic one in the evolution of the British constitutional process, its origins dating back to the Magna Carta. The position requires a non-partisan occupant who is expected to avoid politics and the appearance of bias in political matters.

Wernick’s emotive and, at times, accusatorial testimony seemed to violate every norm and sensibility surrounding his position and its place in the Parliamentary system. Trudeau’s public references to the testimony only compounded concerns of partisanship.

In recent days, Wernick has been described as deeply regretful for the testimony, looking ‘visibly defeated’ and worried. Wernick holds a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Toronto.


Justin Trudeau’s Chief of Staff Katie Telford with former Principle Secretary Gerald Butts. Political operatives expect Telford to be questioned by the RCMP in the SNC Lavalin matter imminently.

Correction: An earlier version of this article states that Michael Wernick “refused to offer his testimony to the Justice Committee under oath”. He did not refuse. Instead, the Liberal majority on the committee voted against him taking an oath before the testimony. Lying to the committee would constitute Contempt of Parliament whether or not an oath was taken.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

The author of article should check the facts before putting them to print. Wernick was not sworn in , was not under oath , the Conservatives requested he be sworn in but the Liberal majority turned down the motion , the Liberal chairman stated they have never done in past and they won’t do it now.

20,The Buffalo Chronicle ,MPs want Wilson-Raybould to talk about Kinder Morgan at a second House hearing,2/27/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"The Liberal Party is deep in crisis mode and the Trudeau government is unlikely to survive October elections. At least six members of the Trudeau cabinet have been privately urging Wilson-Raybould to wage an effort to replace Trudeau as Leader of the Liberal Party.




Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is still refusing to waive cabinet confidentiality to allow former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to discuss the government’s handling of ‘Deferred Prosecution Agreements’ beyond the narrow case of the Montreal based engineering giant, SNC Lavalin.

At Justice Committee hearings in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould was unable to discuss the government’s desire to use the agreements in other cases of corporate bribery and fraud. Wide-ranging improprieties that surround the Bank of Montreal and the Trudeau government’s acquisition of the Kinder Morgan pipeline, continue to worry senior cabinet ministers.

She can’t talk about the tawdry details that surround Treasury Board President Scott Brison‘s sudden departure, either.

Trudeau has cited Brison’s resignation as the reason that he removed Wilson-Raybould as leader of the Justice Ministry. That logic continues to confuse many Canadian political observers who wonder why the Treasury Board President’s resignation would impact the tenure of the Justice Minister?

Among Ottawa-area political operatives, it is widely known that the Trudeau government’s sudden and unexpected acquisition of the Kinder Morgan pipeline — at a top dollar valuation and without the consent of more than one hundred indigenous communities — was rife with improprieties.


It’s rumored that MP Pierre Poilievre, who leads the Conservatives on the finance committee, wants former Kinder Morgan CEO Ian Anderson to appear before the House of Commons to discuss his firm’s consultations with indigenous groups.

The project’s financial backers included Canada’s largest banks and public pension funds. BMO had invested more than $400 million dollars into the project. In August of 2018, it became apparent that the project would not be able to secure the consent of the indigenous communities that would be required to accommodate the pipeline. At the same time, BMO officials feared that third-party business practices (ostensibly endorsed by the bank) could be construed as bribing the elected officials of governments established under the Indian Act.

It’s widely suspected that BMO has been using intermediary business service providers to ‘effectively bribe’ the elected officials of Indian Act-governments, in exchange for pipeline approvals, federally guaranteed lending, and the financing of land claims against the Crown. The practice has been a source of outrage among indigenous people in the Province, who remain vehemently opposed to carbon-based energy infrastructure.

Worried that the practice violates the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, banking executives hurridly lobbied Finance Minister Bill Morneau in March and April of 2018, and were able to quickly secure a transaction that effectively nationalized the pipeline while offering exceedingly favorable terms of indemnification to the investors involved in the project.

Months later, Trudeau and Morneau would propose selling the same pipeline to Canada’s Indian Act governments — at similarly inflated equity valuations and with positions to be financed by Canada’s big banks, including BMO. The motivation was to recoup the investment capital lost by the exit of the Kinder Morgan investors by lending Indian Act governments the cash to purchase a pipeline that, in the end, is unlikely to ever be built.


Indigenous people have become increasingly upset with the Trudeau government. Once bold calls for reconciliation have been exposed to be little more than empty rhetoric — with the Trudeau government stubbornly unwilling to renegotiate the indigenous relationship outside of the Indian Act. In recent years, practices that resemble bribery have outraged indigenous leaders in British Columbia.

Sources close to the Conservative opposition leader have told The Chronicle, on the condition of anonymity, that Andrew Scheer has reason to suspect that Brison’s resignation on January 10th was part of a wider effort to shield the government and BMO executives from wide-ranging improprieties related to the firm’s engagement with Canada’s indigenous people.

When it became apparent that Wilson-Raybould would be unwilling to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to BMO and other worried corporate actors, on grounds similar to her refusal to offer such an agreement to SNC Lavalin, Trudeau was terrified that the scandal could take down his government. By late December, he became determined to remove Wilson-Raybould at all costs.

Trudeau’s now infamous cabinet shuffle was announced on January 10, and by February 14 Brison was hired by BMO Capital Markets as Vice Chairman of the firm’s investment banking business. Opposition committee members want Trudeau’s former Principal Secretary, Gerald Butts, who is rumored to have played a role in arranging Brison’s ‘soft-landing’, to testify as well.

Despite calls from opposition party leaders for a more expansive waiver of cabinet confidentiality, Trudeau has rebuffed those demands. Political staffers close to Scheer expected that he will call for Wilson-Raybould to appear before the committee a second time — with the protections of a ‘complete waiver’ of cabinet confidentiality.


Gerald Butts may no longer be working inside the PMO, but he continues to be seen as the ‘shadow minister’, a puppet master of sorts who controls the Trudeau cabinet from outside of the federal government. That has prompted calls on the political operative to disclose his client list.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

Should the next leader of the Liberal party be a woman that could be very positive considering the character of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott. It’d be a disaster, though, if Chrystia Freeland advanced despite the series of messes in her Ministry. Add to those problems, Freeland has helped propagate the Magnitsky hoax and her personal politics and background leave her blind to the dangers created through her support of international con-man, convicted tax-evader, Bill Browder and such harmful actors.

35,The Buffalo Chronicle ,‘Deep and penetrating’ relationship may taint Butts’ testimony,3/6/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Trudeau and Butts on a hiking trip to the Northwest Territories.




Sometimes a defense witness’ close personal friendship with a defendant discredits his testimony because of the likelihood for bias in favor of the defense.

Friends at McGill University say Justin Trudeau and Gerald Butts had the kind of ‘deep and penetrating’ relationship that is common among privileged young men in their late teens and early twenties: lofty in their aspirations, pedestrian in their work ethic, and, at times, ambiguous in their orientation.

Critics say that the depth and intimacy of that friendship call into question the veracity of Butts’ testimony at the House of Commons’ Justice Committee on Wednesday. Widely seen as being ‘thick as thieves’ and partners in the apparent political crime that is SNC Lavalin, it’s hard for many Canadians to believe that Butts would offer a truthful characterization of a plot that he hatched and recommended to the Prime Minister.

Butts ordered the smear campaign against former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould last month, in the days following her resignation from cabinet. It took more than a week before Trudeau disavowed those efforts.

His testimony comes just two days after Jane Philpott, seen by Canadians as the most competent member of Trudeau’s cabinet, resigned her appointment as President of the Treasury Board — a key position at the crux of most federal operations.

In her resignation letter, Philpott explained that she had lost confidence in Trudeau’s handling of the SNC Lavalin controversy, and that she could no longer maintain the constitutional convention of cabinet solidarity, which requires her to defend the government’s decisions.


Since their days on the McGill debate team, Gerald Butts has wanted to become Prime Minister. But he knew early on that Trudeau was the one with the money, name, and charisma to step out front.

Both undergraduates in the liberal arts, the two young men’s friendship grew from a shared a jovial disposition, left-leaning political views, and an occasional fondness for pairing the music of early-90s grunge with their favored varieties of marijuana.

A classmate once reflected that, “[Justin and Gerald] bonded over a shared sensibility around Canadian nationalism and possibility — despite very different backgrounds from two disparate slices of Canada.”

Butts grew up in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, a coastal mining town of about 20,000. He is the son of a coal miner and a nurse, the youngest of six. It was worlds away from McGill’s campus.

Trudeau was born the son of the Prime Minister, more comfortable in the circles that populated McGill’s elite student body. A Quebecer and francophone who graduated from a nearby Catholic High School and lived at his father’s landmark mansion in the heart of the city, Trudeau felt at home on campus.

A classmate, Jonathan Ablett, introduced them freshman year. Butts invited Trudeau to join the debate team, and the pair traveled to tournaments together, including a trip to Princeton University during which the two were observed being ‘particularly close’. Butts was a far more skilled and tactical debater than Trudeau, but Trudeau projected greater confidence.


Trudeau and Butts are longtime friends who work together, who exercise together, and who hatch political plans together.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

Thats why the past politicians legalized same sex, lowered the age of consent so that their children could walk carefree through a country with no values no dicipline
Anything goes. Even tho they are now genderless they are not breaking any laws only values that the world has lived by since the beginning of time.
They can say there is no God but when their time on earth is finished they will stand naked before God. They can deny all they want but they will know the truth in the end. They may think they have no one to be accountable to. It will be a moment of truth.
The blood of Canadian people that have died because of their selfish decisions they have made will be on their hands as evidence of their selfish useless lives. They don’t have a con science. This is the genderless society they are convicts of science (conscience) The curse will follow their generations until the curse has been broken in each generation for four years.

ANYONE who “testifies” MUST do so under oath. If not under oath, then ANYTHING they say MUST be considered BULLSHIT. Especially if taking an oath is REFUSED!!! Think, people. Think. Butts is a flim-flam ass-bandit. He’s come to take your money, your freedom, your faith, your trust, your future, your family’s future and anything else he can take. He’s still working with Hotsox. He’s just not being paid for (directly, ahem) presently by the PMO. He said he spent the last while since resigning going through his texts, etc. He has NO RIGHT to have access to those, as, once no longer employed by the PMO, his devices and access to the data were to be disallowed. Yet, he has access… maybe a friend gave him a secret pass… hmm. My GREAT fear is that this SNC bullshit is simply a smoke-screen for something MUCH MUCH bigger going on with the UN, Soros, Bildeberg, etc… Any hackers out there?… I’ll pay you to dig.

No media has discussed Gywn Morgan. In the Scandal he was the Director in 2011 when all the law breaking occured. He was also best friend of PM Harper. Just a farm boy from Alberta but still a kingpin. Please if you write a story about this in the US at least do some research. The minute the story broke Morgan resigned and isn’t mentioned anywhere as architect of the whole Libyan mess.

SNC-Lavalin wants to build the Kinder Morgan pipeline to secure an energy supply chain to India for the sake of the Commonwealth. India is too dependent on OPEC and this puts all of Southeast Asia at risk of communism or something. This holy mission from the Queen justifies the federal government’s purchase of the pipeline, which SNC-Lavalin lobbyists negotiated with the assistance of diplomats. The DPA agreement is absolutely necessary now, because SNC-Lavalin needs to be eligible to accept federal contracts to build it. And there’s nobody else. They are the ones with the expertise in First Nations bribing, they’re already hard at work on that (thanks Frank). India thinks KM is dying in the courts so shit all over Trudeau during his trip, which seemed decadent and clueless to the BJP.

Jody Wilson-Raybould has no idea any of this is happening when she independently decides there’s no way they are getting a DPA. But everyone assumes that native bitch from BC is pulling the “NO PIPELINES ON STOLEN NATIVE LAND” routine that party elders predicted was all she was good for. Everyone begs her to reconsider but can’t really explain why it’s so important. Scott Brison decides this house of cards is not worth the risk to his post-political career and gets the fuck out of there when he smells smoke coming from the Attorney General’s office. David Lametti is shuffled into the job because as parliamentary secretary to Freeland and Bains he’s in the know on pipeline Plan B. Trudeau threatens Wilson-Raybould with Aboriginal Affairs because he wants to know if this refusal to defer prosecution was a power grab, he’s making a joke that everything is Indian Affairs to her anyway, and he is anticipating that ruthless and unapologetic as she is, she will take it to further her agenda, even if he means it as an insult. He is shocked when she doesn’t, and they improvise with Veteran Services which they are doubly shocked she accepts. She is clueless and stubborn, not sabotaging the pipeline. O’Reagan to Aboriginal Affairs is her punishment for not playing along. It’s imposed collectively because all natives share the blame apparently.

It’s Jane Philpott to Treasury Board that ruins everything for Trudeau. What a blind spot he has for women. She gets the briefing on the KM pipeline 2.0 shit parade that Brison got that sent him packing, and she realizes this is why Jody Wilson-Raybould has lost her job, they
misread her intentions, they didn’t think she was being legalistic, they thought she was knowingly sabotaging Trudeau’s agenda for personal reasons. She got in the way of the pipeline. Philpott tells her what is going on. Wilson-Raybould, finally given a glimpse of the depth of the pit she is in, makes an escape plan and executes it. Philpott realizes that she was exposed on this leak, and her career in politics is over because she is going to be blamed for the Globe and Mail leak as well, so she resigns without regrets. That’s why JWR is staying gagged on what happened while she was at Veterans Affairs. That’s why the ethics commissioner got too sick to investigate. That’s why the PMO can’t make any sense of what is going on and why the PM won’t explain anything. It’s a conspiracy!

Anonymous, that explains why there was no negotiating on the cost of the old and new KM pipeline, more than 11 billion was given to KM for the purchase. The whore media don’t report fact. It certainly clarifies why Iacobucci is busy giving away money in BC. If we could only clean out the collectivists and leave gov’t to just police, law courts and soldiers, the world would be a better place, Thanks for the hypothesis, it’s revealing.

“Among Toronto-area political operatives, it’s been rumored that Iacobucci may be one of three men in possession of ’embarrassing information’ on Trudeau.”

I have heard from someone I consider to be very reliable that Trudeau had an affair with one of his students when he was teaching in Vancouver.
The parents didn’t want a public scandal. The school gave Trudeau the option of resigning or having a hearing, he chose to resign from teaching.
I wonder if this is the embarrassing information?

Trudeau (the groper) is so narcissistic that I wouldn’t be surprised.

So was the delay in approving the pipeline fabricated to wait until SNC’s DPA was cleared so they could subsequently qualify to “win” the contract to build the KM pipeline?

This is bullshit. The northeast corner of BC is ceded treaty land, Treaty 8 to be specific. Much of southern Vancouver Island is also ceded treaty land (Douglas Treaty).

Neither the Crown or the Natives want the treaties to be valid for various reasons, but the courts consistently uphold their validity. The pipelines will pass mostly through non-treaty land, sure, but the treaties do exist.

Makes me wonder what else is bullshit in this story.

30,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"At Trudeau’s behest, Gould instructed Google News to limit Canadian access to foreign press",3/16/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Karina Gould, the Minister of Democratic Institutions, graduated in 2013. The position was previously known as the Minister of Democratic Reforms.




In the days approaching former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s testimony to the House of Commons’ Justice Committee on February 27, at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s behest, Karina Gould, the Minister of Democratic Institutions, reached out to social media giant Google to pressure the firm to curtail political criticism of the Trudeau government on its platform.

Gould placed a call to a senior government relations executive at Google, during which she complained about ‘hate speech’ and ‘toxic rhetoric’, referring multiple times to specific criticisms of the Trudeau government that she found objectionable. She then threatened sweeping regulations that would require unprecedented disclosures of advertising sponsors.

The firm’s existing ad systems are not technologically capable of complying with Gould’s demand. It would require a months-long reconstruction of the software to meet the compliance requirements she laid out.

In response, the firm announced that it will not accept political advertising through the October elections. That disappointed Gould, who implored them to reconsider, even complaining to newsmedia that, “they have enormous financial and technical resources… they can get this done.”

In the days following Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, and just two weeks after Gould told a House committee that there was “more she was planning to do” to “limit foreign influence” in the election, The Chronicle noticed that articles published on our digital platform relating to the ongoing SNC Lavalin scandal stopped appearing in Google News search results in Canada. (Our coverage continues to appear in regular Google search results, and in Google News results in the United States).

On the same day as Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Gould turned to iPolitics to publicly disparage a recent Chronicle report, with defamatory comments from Gould and a PMO spokesman. The author of the piece, Charlie Pinkerton, used a Twitter comment made by an obscure reporter who formerly wrote for Vice, to broadly characterize this publication as ‘fake’ news.

iPolitics is a subsidiary of Torstar, the publishing giant managed by Frank Iacobucci (in his capacity as a current board member and former Chairman), who finds himself at the center of the SNC Lavalin – Kinder Morgan Scandal — and a subject of recent reporting by The Chronicle.


Frank Iacobucci is a retired Supreme Court Justice and is at the center of the scandal that is engulfing the Trudeau government. Iacobucci has been working as SNC Lavalin’s in-house attorney in their effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement. He was also appointed by Trudeau to manage the government’s consultations with indigenous people in order to secure approvals for the Trans Mountain Pipeline in British Columbia.



Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council, was the subject of the report that Gould was quick to go to the press in an attempt to discredit for plainly political advantage. Wernick also sits as one of five government officials who comprise the newly formed ‘election protection unit’, who have been tasked by the Cabinet to monitor and neutralize ‘critical election incidents’.



Less than two weeks after the bum iPolitics story, Gould announced that the Trudeau government will include $7 million in this year’s federal budget to monitor and actively discredit political content on social media platforms.



Critics fear that a curtailment of access to foreign press reports would be violative of Canadian norms and the expectations of a free society. At the same time, the Trudeau government plans to offer Canada’s media giants $600 million in operating subsidies, which has unnerved free speech advocates across all party affiliations.



In recent weeks, The Chronicle has unabashedly published a series of articles covering the Trudeau government’s removal of the former Attorney General. With only minor corrections, that reporting has been accurate and prescient.



Contrary to Gould’s public characterization, that journalism was produced by a Canadian from Southern Ontario (which is very much a part of our media market and our body of readership). This writer requested that his name be concealed for fear of political retribution.



Understanding that journalists in the United States enjoy far more sweeping legal protections relating to political speech, our publisher, Matthew Ricchiazzi, was willing to extend that protection to this writer. Ricchiazzi reaffirmed to me personally and to my colleagues that, “as a matter of policy and our Statement on Corporate Social Responsibility, The Chronicle will continue to protect the work of any journalist fearing the retribution of any government anywhere in the world.”","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

31,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Ottawa political operative threatens conservative publisher with ‘fake news’ in The Globe and Mail,3/18/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Justin Ling, an Ottawa-based political reporter whose work appears on some of Canada’s largest national platforms, threatened the publisher of The Chronicle in a revealing email exchange Sunday evening. He threatened to use his access to The Globe and Mail to intentionally report ‘fake news’. We are unable to discern whether the communication was an attempt at political intimidation or extortion.

Ling is a supporter of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and has reported widely on transgender issues. A picture of Trudeau adorns his Twitter profile. Scrolling his social media pages will quickly reveal unabashedly left-leaning political biases.

In the federal government’s budget — expected to be tabled on Tuesday — Trudeau is planning to include a nearly $600 million bailout of Canada’s major media giants, including many left-leaning publications that employ Ling as a freelance writer. Among them, Ling’s work appears in Canadalandshow, Macleans, and The Ottawa Citizen.



That’s the backdrop when Ling placed a phone call to Matthew Ricchiazzi, our publisher, in the days approaching former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s testimony to the House justice committee investigating SNC Lavalin‘s influence peddling.

During the call, Ling was livid and terse. He explained that he had access to several national media platforms, and made accusations against The Chronicle of poor reporting in a story that involved Micheal Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council and member of the Liberal government’s ‘election protection unit’ tasked with monitoring social media for ‘critical election incidents’.

Ricchiazzi asked Ling to email him the inaccuracies he alleged in the piece and ensured him that he would address it privately with the relevant journalist, whose name has not been publicly disclosed for fear of political retribution. Shortly thereafter, a largely inconsequential technical correction was made and appended to that article.

In the days that followed, Ling used his Twitter account to make defamatory characterizations of The Chronicle, which were subsequently cited by iPolitics reporter Charlie Pinkerton (a subsidiary of Frank Iacobucci‘s Torstar), to sweepingly disparage this platform as ‘fake news’.

Then on Sunday evening, Ling initiated this email exchange, in which he threatens to intentionally misreport his communication with Ricchiazzi, and plans to do so in The Globe and Mail: 









The Chronicle takes corporate citizenship seriously. If in refusing to take The Globe & Mail’s interview we can meaningfully protest the increasing concentration of media power in the hands of the government, then Canada’s seemingly imperiled freedom of speech demands that we do so.

We also understand that journalists in the United States enjoy far more sweeping legal protections relating to political speech. We will continue to protect the names of journalists who fear the political retribution of any government, anywhere in the world — most especially when it is in defense of the rights and freedoms of our friends and neighbors.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

Absolutely love it, thank you Matthew Ricchiazzi and the Buffalo Chronicle for pointing out the hypocrisy of Canadian media saying they are journalists and reporters and willing to take taxpayer’s money to supply their version of the news. Until the Buffalo Chronicle reported on the Bank of Montreal’s conduct in the TransMountain expansion I really was surprised how quickly and decisively purchased the pipeline from Kinder Morgan. Thanks to your work it is all making sense.

Good thing there’s no American equivalent, eh? Oh, wait….

“The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, which was contained within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be available within the United States.”

You guys are nuts. There is no direction or control from the government to gain those subsidies. The subsidies are there to protect and stabilize our print media so that Canadians can continue to rely on an independant and free press. Canadian journalists enjoy the same freedoms and rights as their American counterparts. You are way out to lunch on this story.

Its a far left circle jerk with a hint of totalitarianism. Ling is a disgrace to the journalistic practice.. I wish I could say Ling was some fringe weirdo, sadly he is representative of many of far leftist agitators disguised as journalists in Canada. Ling is a prime example of what the death of journalism looks like and in Canada he has a lot of competition.

32,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"Fearing violations of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Lynch threatened SNC job losses",3/22/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Kevin G. Lynch is the Chairman of SNC Lavalin and the Vice Chairman of BMO Financial Group. He served as Clerk of the Privy Council until 2009. Sources say that he was 'instrumental' in arranging former Treasury Board President Scott Brison's departure.




SNC Lavalin Chairman Kevin G. Lynch, who also serves as Bank of Montreal‘s Vice Chairman, placed a call on October 15th to Michael Wernick, during which he repeatedly threatened the Clerk of the Privy Council of a potential loss of 9,000 Canadian jobs — ominously suggesting that the decision was to be made at a looming board meeting. Lynch feared that his firm could be implicated in the widespread bribery of First Nations officials in British Columbia.

Wernick, who holds a bachelors degree in economics from the University of Toronto, did not apply scrutiny to that assertion, despite his training, before repeating the threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in the PMO.

On Wednesday, SNC Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce asserted that, in his lobbying efforts, he never threatened job losses if the firm were not offered a deferred prosecution agreement. He claimed to be unaware of who “makes stuff up”, though his name appears on hundreds of communication disclosures filed with LobbyCanada.

Sources close to Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques tell The Chronicle that isn’t their understanding of events. Lobbyists working on behalf of SNC Lavalin, including the allegedly ‘in-house’ attorney Frank Iacobucci, met multiple times with both men. Following those meetings, Bouchard and Marques were heard repeatedly emphasizing the risk of job losses inside of the PMO and with the office of Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

Following criticism from opposition finance critic Pierre Poillivre in recent weeks, that assertion has become a source of public outrage, given how apparently fabricated that the talking point now appears.

SNC Lavalin is a construction, engineering, and infrastructure company. Poillivre rightly explains that these jobs are bound to Canadian construction and infrastructure projects and will not be lost in the event that the firm relocated abroad. Lease agreements and loan covenants with Quebec’s public pension fund require the firm to remain in Montreal for several years.


Frank Iacobucci is a former Supreme Court Justice. He has simultaneously been tasked by the Trudeau government to lead consultations with indigenous people related to the Trans Mountain Pipeline, while also serving as an ‘in-house’ attorney for SNC Lavalin, tasked with securing a deferred prosecution agreement for the firm. SNC Lavalin has long planned to construct the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

It’s unclear if it was Lynch or Iacobucci who first started using the talking point because neither has fully disclosed their lobbying activities. Iacobucci, who is a partner at Torys, claims to have been working as an ‘in-house’ attorney with SNC Lavalin, which would allow him to skirt lobbying disclosures.

For his part, Lynch is a paid member of a corporate board, and as such is required to disclose all of his lobbying contacts with government officials to LobbyCanada. He did not disclose his phone call to Wernick, and Wernick failed to disclose the conversation in his initial House justice committee testimony.

BMO has a $400 million investment interest in the Trans Mountain Pipeline. That private placement was purchased in the government’s 2018 acquisition, but the firm secured an option to reacquire the position if it chooses to exercise it. Now that the government owns the $7.5 billion construction project, it became even more imperative for the firm to secure a deferred prosecution agreement since a criminal conviction would have banned the firm from performing work on federal projects. The Liberal Party is now planning to have that law changed.

The government’s purchase of the project from the Texas-based Kinder Morgan at top dollar valuations, and with expansive terms of indemnification, was intended to shield executives at SNC Lavalin — including Bruce himself — who fear that they have been culpable in an expansive scheme to bribe First Nations’ officials in British Columbia, from whom they need to secure consent (not merely consultation) for pipeline approvals.

Like many federal contracting giants, particularly in government-funded construction, SNC Lavalin meticulously manages its pipeline of projects — and budgets heavily for ‘selling, general, and administrative’ expenses associated with those procurement processes.

The Trans Mountain Pipeline’s court-related delays have caused a considerable hiccup in the firm’s financial statement, which includes a 26.8% decline in its oil and gas business from 2017 to 2018.

In Canada’s elite business and political circles, it’s long been suspected that SNC Lavalin and BMO have both been engaging with indigenous people in unseemly ways — BMO doing so through third parties in an effort to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States; while SNC Lavalin has engaged directly, in a fashion similar to the firm’s engagement with Saadi Gaddafi.



American anti-corruption laws were driving BMO, SNC Lavalin concerns

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is an American law known primarily for two of its main provisions: one that addresses accounting transparency requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and another concerning bribery of foreign officials. It’s likely that SNC Lavalin and BMO have violated both.

FCPA prohibits firms with any registered class of securities trading in the United States from influencing foreign officials with any personal payments or rewards. The FCPA applies to any person who has a certain degree of connection to the United States and engages in corrupt practices abroad, as well as to U.S. businesses, foreign corporations trading securities in the U.S., American nationals, citizens, and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice, whether or not they are physically present in the U.S.


Justin Trudeau with Scott Brison and his husband, Maxime Saint-Pierre. Brison was named Vice Chairman of BMO Capital Markets within weeks of resigning from the House of Commons. As Treasury Board President he was responsible for federal payments. At BMO he will have oversight responsibilities for the investment bank’s $400 million investment interest in the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

Direct payments to foreign officials, candidates, and parties, or any other recipient would violate the law if the payments are in furtherance of influencing a foreign official, candidate, or party. These payments are not restricted to monetary forms and may include anything of value.

BMO, Kinder Morgan, and SNC Lavalin are all subject to this act — and executives at each firm were concerned that their payments to indigenous groups constitute bribery of foreign officials.

It’s become common practice among multi-national firms to engage third parties to provide high-risk business functions in an effort to insulate executives with legal and reputational exposure related to FCPA, but under that law, corporations are accountable for corrupt activities performed on their behalf through third party service providers.

BMO’s relationship with Indigenous Canadians

BMO is widely credited with inventing what is now referred to as aboriginal banking in the late 1990s, when it was impossible to secure a mortgage loan for a home in a Reserve community because of the prospect of no-recovery default (commercial banks can’t repossess Indian land). A banker there with Indian status, Ron Jamieson, was able to convince the bank and federal regulators to solve the problem by offering loans only to Reserve members whose creditworthiness was so pristine that the Reserve’s band council would guarantee the loan.

The program is highly lucrative for BMO and averages lower default rates than the market at large. Since the Reserve government would be responsible for any loan defaults (the Reserve government can repossess land on territory), the bank enjoyed risk-free lending at higher interest rates than the non-aboriginal mortgage market.


Paul Summers, John Dutschek, Ron Jamieson, and Murray Koffler

Jamieson retired from BMO as a Senior Vice President in 2006.

By that time, Canada’s banking industry began to see indigenous communities in a new light: as emerging markets. Canada’s major banks — considered ‘federal works’ — now offer a slate of lending products, from financing land claim litigation to water infrastructure and managing endowment or trust assets.

Following Jamieson’s retirement from the bank, he has been involved in a slew of aboriginal-themed investment vehicles and consultancies. He is a founding director of Denendeh Investments Incorporated, which describes itself as the General Partner of Denendeh Investments LP, a private equity investment vehicle intended to monetize energy resources in the Northwest Territories on behalf of indigenous groups.

He is also a partner in First Canadians Property Investments Limited, which specializes in advising First Nations governments on investment opportunities, equity and debt financings, alternative energy projects, water distribution systems, public-private-partnerships (PPPs), asset valuations, dealing with government agencies, and financing litigation expenses.

First Nations governments comprising the Indian Resource Council, are being lobbied by the Trudeau government to purchase the Trans Mountain project, largely to recoup monies from Kinder Morgan’s exit. Trudeau hopes to “align the interests” of indigenous groups with the energy industry.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

I’ve been trying to get someone in Canada to see that we are NOT following the as-written BNA/Constitution of 1867- and this is the BIGGEST of the problems, but no one sees it. The Clerk of the (s.11) Privy Council is part of the Executive Power -which reports to the (s.12) Governor General (who was intended to “look out for” the best interests of the Crown/now the public). In 1940 during a wartime emergency an Order in Council #PC1940-1121 merged / seconded/ usurped the office of Secretary to the Cabinet Legislative Power WITH the office of Clerk of the Privy Council (Executive). Imagine merging the office of USA President with Speaker of the Combined House & Senate – too much power in one place!. Google P.C.1940-1121 and some of my posts/ posts etc will pop up, plus my diagrams and the Order itself. I hope this interests you. It’s so big no one here (except one chap in Nova Scotia and one in Manitoba) a) can see it, b) appreciates what it means and c) thinks I can do anything about it. Robert Ede 416-819-7333

34,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"SNC Lavalin CEO’s wife, employed by Stephen Bronfman, to leave Canada imminently",3/26/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Emma Griffin and Neil Bruce, the CEO of SNC Lavalin, sold their Montreal home on March 14th for more than $3.3 million. They have not purchased a new home, and Journal de Quebec is reporting that the deed of sale for their Westmount home states that “she will soon become a non-resident of Canada”.

It’s unclear if her move abroad is motivated by fear of criminal charges. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has had an open investigation into the firm since it was indicted by Swiss prosecutors in 2012.

Bruce, as far as we know, does not intend to leave the country. He has said publicly that he plans to remain in Montreal but is in no rush to purchase another home.

It was reported by TVA Nouvelles last month that Griffin was working as a non-executive director of Claridge Inc., the investment arm of Stephen Bronfman, the son of billionaire Charles Bronfman, an heir of the Seagrams liquor fortune. Bronfman is a Liberal treasurer and has been described as a close friend to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In response to that report, Trudeau publicly denied that his office ever discussed the SNC Lavalin case with Bronfman.

The Bronfmans have been the Liberal Party’s chief financiers for nearly 100 years.

“Yes, she is on my advice,” Bronfman confirmed to Le Journal. “She is a very good businesswoman who provides considerable expertise.”

Though she has no presence on the investment firm’s website, her move abroad is not expected to affect her employment position with Bronfman.


Stephen Bronfman, one of the richest men in Canada, on the campaign trail with Justin Trudeau in 2013. His family has financed the Liberal Party for more than 100 years.

Bronfman’s cousin, Sara Bronfman, is married to Basit Igtet.

In 2010 Igtet founded the Independent Libya Foundation (ILF), an organization focused on supporting the fledgling rebel movement, and upon its founding, the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC).

Spearheading the Bronfman financed campaign, Igtet lobbied for support from the international community to augment the process of recognition of the NTC as the sole legitimate governing body of Libya, following the assassination of Momahr Gaddafi in October of 2011.

Earlier that year, in March 2011, Igtet hosted General Abdul Fatah Younis, the former Interior Minister of Libya under the Gaddafi government. Younis would become the leader of the rebel armed forces shortly thereafter. Igtet facilitated dialogue between Younis and NATO during a critical time for the rebel movement — which ultimately benefited from a NATO-led military intervention in 2011 to “defend the Libyan people from Gaddafi forces”.

On November 19, 2011, Igtet organized an ILF delegation in Benghazi, Libya to present strategies for rebel re-integration. He aspired to become the leader of Libya.

SNC Lavalin was indicted by Swiss prosecutors related to their dealings with the Libyan government and now faces trial in Canada in the coming months. The firm is alleged to have spent more than $48 million on the widespread bribery of officials in the government of Gaddafi from 2001 to 2011.

That bribery included boats, cash payments, and prostitutes procured for his son, Saadi Gaddafi, while he visited the firm’s Montreal headquarters. In exchange, the firm secured billions of dollars in construction contracts from that government — including for oil and gas pipelines that the firm was to construct and operate.

1,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Chrystia Freeland is angling to succeed Trudeau as Prime Minister,4/2/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"In recent weeks, Freeland has been in regular communication with Gerald Butts, formerly Trudeau's chief political operative. In recent strategy discussions, Butts has been willing to 'think beyond' Trudeau's tenure.




Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has been regularly engaging in private conversations with Stephen Bronfman — the Liberal Party’s treasurer — in recent weeks, a staffer inside her office tells The Chronicle. The Bronfmans have been the principal financiers of the Liberal Party of Canada for more than one hundred years.

Worried about the stability of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s government, Mr. Bronfman initiated at least one of those conversations in a private phone call in February, during which Freeland offered Bronfman reassurances that — in the event Trudeau is forced to resign — Cabinet would be prepared to act swiftly to ensure the party would have a ‘robust message’ heading into October elections.

Freeland even named herself as a ‘suitable and likely’ successor to Trudeau, noting by name that Ministers Carolyn Bennett, Bill Morneau, and Catherine McKenna are ‘solidly’ in her camp, should the situation necessitate a battle for the leadership post. Joyce Murray, Ralph Goodale, and Carla Qualthrough were identified as being obstacles to her succession.


The tension between the newly named Treasury Board President Joyce Murray and Chrystia Freeland has complicated recent Cabinet meetings. Trudeau, a more junior MP, had challenged Murray for the Liberal Party’s leadership in 2013. She nearly defeated the less experienced ‘golden boy’. Many see Murray as a more worthy successor to Trudeau than Freeland, who continues to endure criticism for her handling of NAFTA and is less popular in the Western region of the country.

Not long after that call, Freeland had a ‘serendipitous’ encounter with Charles Bronfman, the 87-year-old brother of the late Edgar Bronfman, Sr, who encouraged her to ‘keep quiet’, having seen her name mentioned as Trudeau’s likely successor and noting the appearance of several editorials encouraging her to seek the post.

Freeland, with the reflexes of a diplomat, hurriedly denied that she would position herself to succeed Trudeau publicly and blamed the talk on ‘political speculators’, a term that created some awkwardness in the conversation. Neither wanted to ask the other whether Bronfman was the ‘political speculator’ to whom she, perhaps unknowingly, referenced.

The same source tells The Chronicle that Freeland has been heard in her office ‘reciting grandiose political rhetoric’ by herself — as if she were rehearsing for a pivotal speech.


Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould is the most popular political figure in Canada — at a time when the Prime Minister’s approval rating is lower than Donald Trump’s. She was expelled from the Liberal Party caucus this afternoon, largely for her refusal to end what has been called “the most important public corruption trial in Canadian history”.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

So the Bronfmans are going to pick our next PM – think again the Liberals are gone gone gone – for good this time – too much corruption and far too much un-Canadian behavior – arrogance, elitism, cronyism and money – Canadians just want a government to do right by the people all the people and Trudeau and his gang blew it.

If the Libs were paying attention they would realize that assurance of re-election would come with a leadership convention, I believe that a Border Collie in a three piece suit could beat the current loser.

Having now been ejected from caucus and denied the right to run as a Liberal in the upcoming election she’d have to be brought back in the fold against the vociferous opposition of the more corrupt members of the Librano caucus and in order to have any hope of winning an election as the new leader of the LPC she’d have to purge most of cabinet and a significant number of the current caucus despite which she’d still have a herculean task in restoring Canadian’s confidence in the LPC ……. then again there’s the party’s current regressive ideology and four years of divisive and destructive policies to scrap and start over again. Therefore I doubt the “hail mary wet dream” is possible.

2,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"Jody and Jane, now the most powerful politicians in Canada, consider how to wield it",4/8/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Political prognosticators believe that Jane Philpot is the only Liberal in Ontario with the stature to successfully challenge Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford.




Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott — with the sheer force of their own integrity — have emerged as the most influential politicians in the Canadian body politic. Justin Trudeau has exposed himself plainly as a liar — someone who is willing to repeatedly lie in order to manipulate the electorate, mislead authorities, and to keep a tightly controlled caucus intimidated with a culture of bile and retaliation.

Influence is power in politics, and suddenly these two former Cabinet ministers have all of it. And Justin Trudeau has none of it. His tenure in the Prime Minister’s office is quickly fleeting, and even senior members of the Liberal caucus have suffered shocking losses of confidence — not only in his leadership style — but also in his capacity to lead.

The Nation waits with bated breath in anticipation of how the two suddenly senior statesmen — statespeople? — are planning to wield this unprecedented stature. They are both ambitious and accomplished women willing to risk extraordinarily promising political careers to protect Canada from falling the way of dictators.

Only because they decided to sacrifice themselves, was Trudeau’s coup-de-ta stopped in its tracks. Unless, of course, Attorney General David Lametti decides that his political career inside the Liberal Party is more important than prosecutorial independence, in which case we can expect SNC Lavalin to receive the deferred prosecution agreement.


Top tier candidates have been expressing interest in challenging the new Attorney General David Lametti in his LaSalle-Émard-Verdun riding. The District is thought to be a reliably left-leaning constituency near the heart of Montreal, but the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois are expected to field aggressive campaigns.

In recent days, The Chronicle has spoken with several longtime political operatives who see a slate of strategic possibilities for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott’s new axis of power. In fact, every one of the twelve political consultants with whom we talked, all near lust for the opportunity to advise them.

Elizabeth May‘s Green Party extended both women an eager invitation to join her caucus, as did various members of the New Democrats. Both parties badly want Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to join their caucus in senior leadership roles, but their stature easily outshines that of the New Democrats’ Leader Jagmeet Singh.

Managing the micro-politics could be difficult. It’s unclear if Singh or May would be willing to step aside as Leader. Several senior figures in the NDP fear that, if the women join the Greens, it would be felt like a stunning blow to any energy or momentum that the NDP can hope for ahead of elections. They dream aloud of a merger between the two parties — The Green Democrats — suddenly led by a slew of substantial nationally known figures.


NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is being urged by his caucus to consider stepping aside to invite the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to serve as Leader. The NDP fears that Wilson-Raybould, were she to issue a national call for candidates, has the public goodwill to recruit and field a full slate, coast to coast. That could create an existential crisis for the NDP.

Several dissident Liberal Party operatives, some with longtime ties to the newly appointed Treasury Board President Joyce Murray, want the MPs to establish a new center-left ‘Progressive Party’ party on a populist platform focused on supply-side housing policy that addresses affordability, in addition to government ethics, and constitutional reforms that protect the independence of the justice system.

That agenda — housing affordability, government ethics, and the independence of the justice system — would substantially replace the Liberal Party in Parliament, by his analysis, appealing to a ‘disaffected majority’ of Liberal voters.

The SNC Lavalin scandal has badly tainted the Liberal MPs who have been most willing to publicly defend Trudeau. Maryam Monsef‘s mindless nodding behind Trudeau in the House of Commons, as he articulated transparently deceptive assertions, now makes her reelection implausible. Operatives call it the curse of the camera angle and are already using the footage to test campaign spots against every MP who had approvingly gestured behind Trudeau as he lied to Canadians on the House floor.


The legal principles on which Wilson-Raybould objected to partisan interference in the justice system highlights a broader need for sweeping new separations of powers. Too much power in the Canadian system emanates from the Crown rather than from the people or from the Provinces, as is the foundation of the American constitutional system.

Bardish Chagger, the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons who speaks for the Trudeau government when he is not present in the House, has endured embarrassing footage that makes her look untruthful, repetitive, and resistant to facts.

A Liberal operative from Markham describes the caucus members as “dangerously shallow and doting politicos who lack stature and the wisdom of tenure” that have, historically, acted as a check on the power of the Prime Minister. He argues that the political culture being promoted by Trudeau’s leadership style is built on the kind of bile and retribution that has enabled dictatorships in parliamentary systems around the world.

Now that the Trudeau government is increasingly likely to be ousted in the October elections, many political prognosticators predict that Wilson-Raybould will emerge in the wake of those sweeping losses as the most powerful political figure in Canada — most likely as the Leader of the Official Opposition, he posits.

He only wonders under what Party brand she will decide to lead it.


Joyce Murray, the new Treasury Board President, has been finding ‘unsettling’ federal payments made on such contrived premises that they strain credulity. Ostensibly unrelated to the Trans Mountain Pipeline’s approval, the payments are suspectly timed to the government’s push to begin construction on the $7 billion infrastructure project.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

48,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"Federal spending on foreign abortions increased to $700m, infuriating Canada’s indigenous people",9/3/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced earlier this summer that his government would spend more than $700 million a year to fund abortions overseas, Canada’s indigenous people were stunned. Now, that shock is beginning to turn into anger and outrage.

“Canada is paying $700 million to kill the babies of indigenous people around the world,” explains one First Nations activist. “While most indigenous babies here in Canada don’t have access to clean drinking water.”

“If that’s not genocide, I don’t know what is,” she adds.

Trudeau plans to increase Canada’s foreign aid spending on ‘women’s health’ to more than $1.3 billion annually by 2023. Meanwhile, more than 140 indigenous communities in Canada still suffer from drinking water that is so toxic that government officials warn them not to consume it.

Most of Canada’s northern industries, from uranium mining to lumber mills, have used the vast wilderness’ various rivers to dispose of industrial byproduct. Decades of doing so have poisoned the drinking supplies of most First Nations reserves, most of whom lack basic infrastructure.

So when Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan told an 8-year-old indigenous girl last July that, “I’ve heard you, and no one wants you to suffer one more day,” she told him flatly that he was lying. It was a bellwether moment at the Assembly of First Nations convention, a lobbying group comprised of federal works agencies known as ‘band councils’, which are constructed and governed by the Indian Act.


Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan was appointed to replace Jane Philpott. Philpott was widely seen as one of Trudeau’s most competent cabinet ministers. But it’s been said that O’Regan is not up to the challenges at the Ministry.

Just two weeks prior, the residents of Attawapiskat, Ontario were told at an emergency meeting to limit their water usage after chemicals were noticed infiltrating the Attawapiskat River. Critics say that the Trudeau government hasn’t given the crisis the attention it needs — especially in light of the billions of dollars in foreign aid that the government has committed in recent weeks.

“We are a third world nation here in Canada, and Trudeau has no right to expropriate the natural resources of indigenous people here, and then gift the exploits of that theft to kill indigenous babies abroad,” explains another activist from the Six Nations Reserve in Ohsweken, ON.

“Those billions of dollars in our resource wealth should be used to build out drinking water infrastructure in Reserve communities — which are being actively poisoned by the extraction of those very resources,” he adds. “Trudeau is an intellectually-limited liar and a phony.”

Earlier this year there has been a national outcry for the government to solve this crisis, after the Prime Minister had two indigenous attendees of a high-priced Liberal Party fundraiser in Toronto forcibly removed, after being asked about the community of Grassy Narrows, where the mercury from a nearby lumber mill has poisoned nearly every member of the community.


Following Trudeau’s removal of the first indigenous Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, his government has been engulfed in a wide-ranging scheme to obstruct the criminal prosecution of a wealthy corporate contributor to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Trudeau has been criticized for lacking attention to indigenous issues and having an exceptionally shallow understanding of North American and indigenous political history. Despite lofty campaign-time rhetoric on reconciliation during his 2015 election campaign, his government hasn’t delivered on any of its major commitments.

Tensions have grown so hostile between the Trudeau government and indigenous communities that the Prime Minister was forced to flee a Labor Day Parade in Hamilton after being confronted by indigenous protesters who stopped the procession, demanding answers for his government’s inaction on the mercury contamination in Grassy Narrows.

Canada’s aboriginal population comprises about 6% of the nation’s population. But the portion of the population that identifies as indigenous, but who lack government-sanctioned status, comprise a significantly larger portion of the population — perhaps as much 23% by some demographers’ estimates.

Together, the constituency can be powerful in the context of Parliamentary elections, where multiparty contests could yield a majority government with less than 30% of the electorate. Even the slightest polling margins could swing control of 40 or 60 seats in the House of Commons.


It’s been alleged that SNC Lavalin had long sought the $7 billion infrastructure contract to construct the proposed Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion. Their lobbyist, former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iaccobucci, was also tasked by the Trudeau government with managing consultations with indigenous communities along the pipeline’s route.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

47,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Trudeau is rumored to be in talks with an accusor to suppress an explosive sex scandal,10/7/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Less than two weeks ahead of federal elections that have already been looking conclusively grim for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, rumors of an explosive sex scandal are percolating at the highest echelons of Canada’s media establishment.

Ottawa’s longest-tenured political observers had been expecting a career-ending expose in Saturday’s edition of The Globe and Mail — but that story never came. Sources are now telling The Chronicle that Trudeau is in private talks with the principal source of that piece to suppress explosive sex allegations that, if made public, would likely force Trudeau to resign his office.

Trudeau’s accuser is said to be a former student at West Point Grey Academy and the daughter of a wealthy Canadian businessman. Sources tell The Chronicle that she is being represented by counsel and is being offered monetary compensation in exchange for a pending, but not yet signed, non-disclosure agreement.


Justin Trudeau appearing in a West Point Grey Academy yearbook.

Trudeau worked as a substitute teacher at the private school from 1999 until an abrupt and poorly explained departure in June of 2001. At the time of his departure he hired his father’s lawfirm, Heenan Blaikie, to represent him in the matter. The firm issued a bizarre statement that denied that Trudeau was leaving his part-time position in order to pursue public speaking opportunities. He was 29 years old.

The Chronicle is unable to evaluate the veracity of widespread rumors that Trudeau regularly received fellatio from students while on the private school’s campus. He worked at the academy as a substitute teacher in drama, social studies, and mathematics.

Just over a year after his departure, he began studying engineering at Polytechnique Montreal but left that program shortly thereafter.

37,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Trudeau accusor lands a seven-figure NDA to keep quiet about West Grey departure,10/10/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Sources are telling The Buffalo Chronicle that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s accuser has been in talks with a private attorney for more than a week, discussing a heated sexual relationship that began and ended more than 18 years ago, when the young woman was a student at Vancouver’s prestigious West Point Grey Academy. The Chronicle is told that the two engaged in a months-long affair beginning in the summer of 2000, both on and off-campus.

That non-disclosure and an accompanying non-disparagement agreement were signed last night, according to the source, for more than $2.25 million CDN.

A friend of the accusor’s family reached out to The Chronicle days ago, prior to the signing of the non-disclosure agreement, when its terms were not in effect and still being negotiated. Those talks took nearly two weeks and took place almost entirely in Vancouver.

By Saturday evening, Trudeau’s negotiator became impatient, giving the young woman a deadline of 10pm on Wednesday evening to either agree to or reject the terms of the NDA. The Chronicle became familiar with the situation shortly after Trudeau’s negotiator made that threat.

The young woman and her attorneys were insisting that the terms be mutually binding on Trudeau (in which case Trudeau would be liable for damages if he were to publicly discuss the circumstances of their relationship himself). Trudeau’s attorneys repeatedly refused that request, which was cause for the delay.

It is unknown whether the terms of the final agreement are mutually binding.

Trudeau taught at the West Point Grey Academy between 1999 and 2001 but departed the school abruptly mid-term, and without substantial explanation. At the time he was 29 years old and retained his father’s law firm, Heenan Blaikie, in the matter. The firm released a bizarre statement at the time, in which Trudeau asked the public “not to make things up” about the departure, and insisted that he did not leave to pursue public speaking engagements.

In recent days, Trudeau has denied that he left the school for nefarious reasons, and denied that he signed an NDA at the time of his departure. The family of his accuser does not share that recollection and was told by officials of the school at the time that Trudeau would be bound by a confidentiality agreement that he signed prior to taking his teaching position.

Trudeau has claimed that he was simply moving on with his career. But shortly after he left that position as a full-time substitute teacher, he took a similar but lower-paying position at a nearby public high school. Within a year’s time, he would move back to Montreal where he would pursue shortlived studies in engineering.

Trudeau’s accusor is the daughter of a wealthy Canadian businessman. He asked that she not be identified in our reporting.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

38,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"With landslide loss for Trudeau expected, Wilson-Raybould is likely to run for Leader",10/14/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"It is becoming increasingly likely that former Justice Minister and Attorney of General of Canada, Jody Wilson-Raybould, will run for Leader of the Liberal Party, despite being unilaterally kicked out of the caucus by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in April, following damning testimony that detailed his government’s complicity in a wide-ranging conspiracy to shield one of the party’s largest donors, SNC Lavalin, from criminal prosecution.

Now, with less than a week remaining in federal parliamentary elections, the Liberals are widely expected to lose more than half of the seats that they currently hold in the House of Commons, in roughly equal proportion to three opposition parties: the Conservatives, the New Democrats, and the Bloc Quebecois.

Going into the 2015 federal elections, the Liberal Party held only 38 seats in the House. Trudeau narrowly won a battle to lead the party in 2013, and was responsible for recruiting a slate of political neophytes with little experience in politics. They came out of the election with 183 seats.

Trudeau — who was criticized for his lack of readiness, depth, and experience during the leadership fight against Joyce Murray, and during his initial 2008 election contest in Papineau against Vivian Barbot — was always concerned that more statured figures in the party would make him appear weak and lacking in contrast.


Until recently, Joyce Murray was iced from Liberal Party leadership circles following a narrow loss to Justin Trudeau for Leader. In his desperation to stabilize his government in the aftermath of the SNC Lavalin affair earlier this year, Trudeau asked Murray to serve as President of the Treasury Board. Jane Phillpot, who was widely seen as Trudeau’s most competent and capable Minister, resigned from that role cabinet position in protest of the government’s interference in SNC Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.

Critics have long contended that Trudeau excluded Murray and Karen McCrimmon from his cabinet because he preferred political newcomers who he felt were more doting and unwilling to challenge him. Both were exceptionally well-qualified MPs and steeped in expertise.

In a different situation that demonstrates a similar bias, Trudeau refused to offer the widely respected legal scholar, Deborah Coyne, an opportunity to run under the party banner in 2015, essentially exiling her to the Green Party line. He gave Martha Hall Findley, an accomplished entrepreneur and storied Member of Parliament, the same cold shoulder.


When Trudeau was first considering how he would enter federal politics in 2008, he decided to target an incumbent Black women who represented the second-poorest riding in Canada, known now as Papineau. Critics say that Trudeau used ‘dog-whistles’ to narrowly win that riding. Vivian Barbot was a pioneering political figure in Quebec who rose to become the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. An educator by profession, she emerged as one of Quebec’s most ardent advocates.

“There’s nothing that irks Trudeau more than strong, assertive women who have opinions and views of the world,” explains a former Liberal Party staffer who asked not to be named. “He likes dumb women who swoon mindlessly and fawn over the frivolousness of his looks.”

“That’s exactly why he refused to appoint McCrimmon the Minister of Defense, despite her being a veteran and having such an inspiring military career. I was in the meeting where he called her ‘moody’ and said she was too hard to get along with,” he tells The Chronicle.

McCrimmon is the MP for Kanata-Carlton, first elected in 2011, following a 31-year military career, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. She was the first female navigator and the first woman to command a Canadian Forces air force squadron. Many hoped she would be appointed the first woman to lead that ministry on a permanent basis. (Kim Campbell briefly served as Defense Minister for six months in 1993 on an interim basis).


Liberal MP Karen McCrimmon was the first woman to command a Canadian Airforce Squadron. In 2015, it was widely thought that she would be named Minister of National Defense in a Trudeau government.

Eva Nassif is an Arabic translator and a registered nurse with a Master’s degree from Concordia University. She was elected to represent the riding of Vimy on the Island of Montreal in the 2015 federal election. Despite actively running for reelection for months, Trudeau abruptly replaced her on the ballot at the last minute and without notice.

He did so, she argues, in retaliation for her refusing to publicly defend him as a feminist in the aftermath of the SNC Lavalin scandal.


Trudeau refused to allow Eva Nassif to run for reelection, essentially kicking her out of the party. He did so without notice and without consultation with local party officials in the riding.

“Following this election cycle, all of Trudeau’s doting lemmings will be ousted from the House, which sets an incredible stage for the next leadership battle,” the former Trudeau staffer explains. “I don’t think anyone has as compelling a narrative — or more universal name recognition — than Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

“But if the Liberal losses aren’t deep enough, I think she’d be discouraged to seek the leadership post. I’d imagine her wanting to come in and recruit a fresh slate of candidates who are more statured, substantive, and learned than the types of candidates that Trudeau prefers to recruit,” he explains.

“Expect fewer Olympic rowers and more research scientists and economists in a Wilson-Raybould government.”


Jane Philpott, now a storied political figure in her own right, is running for reelection as an Independent a in tied threeway contest in the riding of Markham-Stouffville, a wealthy suburban community north of Toronto. Trudeau removed Jane Philpott from Cabinet at the same time he removed Wilson-Raybould. Though he cited the former Justice Minister’s recording of the Clerk of the Privy Council as an offense to his government, Philpott did not. She was kicked out of the Liberal caucus for offending Trudeau by resigning from his cabinet.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

39,The Buffalo Chronicle ,RCMP source says ‘security risk’ against Trudeau was contrived by PMO staffers,10/15/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"A retired officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who remains in frequent communication with senior figures inside the federal agency, is telling The Chronicle that the widely publicized ‘security threat’ against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday night in Mississauga was “largely contrived by political staffers” inside the PMO.

Hoping to elicit sympathy in the national political discourse, senior PMO staffers actively instructed the RCMP on which equipment and weaponry to have present, which uniforms protective officers would wear, and which security precautions would be taken at the private invitation-only Liberal Party event.

Those conversations were initiated, the source claims, by political operatives Mathieu Bouchard and Ben Chin — both of whom report directly to Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister’s principal secretary, and Katie Telford, the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff.


Many in Ottawa call Ben Chin “Trudeau’s Brain,” in reference to his outsized influence over strategy and direction inside of the Prime Minister’s Office. His influence with Trudeau now rivals that of Gerald Butts.

The extra security precautions are rumored to have cost Canadian taxpayers an extra $135,000 that the RCMP had not already been planning to spend that evening — mostly for labor and overtime costs associated with the movement of heavy weaponry.

“If there were an actual threat, the building would have been evacuated, and bomb-sniffing dogs would have searched the entire building and grounds immediately. They wouldn’t have left hundreds of women and children packed in a ballroom for hours,” he explains. “But the political staffers wanted to see him in a vest for the cameras.”

“They were barely checking IDs at the door,” he said. “They were treating the officers on the scene like props, and it very much offended the top officials at the agency.”

Shortly after the event, PMO staffers began pushing word of an unspecified security risk to foreign news outlets — including The New York Times and The Washington Post.

Why did they exist under Harper if they’re so tough on criminals as you say? Illegal immigration is a crime and the Conservatives did nothing to end Sanctuary Cities when they had the power in their grasp to do so. Maxime Bernier is the only one who will truly be tough with crime. Border crime is the biggest issue concernng crime that we have. The other kinds of crime aren’t costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year.

I retired from RCMP HQ years ago (I was not a police officer but I knew police programs and operations in conducting my work). This story does not merit being taken seriously because if there was a security threat it would solely be RCMP Protective Services responsible 24/7 for protecting the PM and his family to determine the preventative measures to be taken given the particulars of the threat. While it is possible that the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) staff could have spawned such a false threat, based on my reading of this story with scant detail, I have to say it is false. And press in Canada would pounce on this if they thought it had merit and was possibly true. A Buffalo reporter alone is less likely to have any real insider information on foreign affairs than many papers and media sources in Canada. Now, on another topic, if you really want to know the state of Canadian economy and affairs, you have to forget the Canadian press and read such papers as The Economist, The Guardian, and magazines like Walrus (Canadian).

40,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"Tipped off by PMO, SNC Lavalin CEO left Canada fewer than 36 hours before he was to be arrested",10/16/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Bruce was worried in December of 2018, when the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei was arrested in Canada for extradition to the United States. That firm is alleged to have violated trade sanctions against Iran. SNC Lavalin had been violating trade sanctions against Libya, doing business there prior to 2006. That company's ongoing criminal prosecution is expected to reveal that tens of millions of dollars in bribes paid to Libyan entities ended up flowing to militant groups in the region.




Former SNC Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce fled Canada just three days before he was expected to be arrested on bribery charges relating to a series of meetings that he and an attorney, Frank Iaccobucci, engaged in late last year to discuss the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion with a handful of key counterparties.

SNC Lavalin had long prized that $7 billion infrastructure contract and Iaccobucci had been tasked by the Trudeau government to manage its consultations with indigenous people in British Columbia. Iaccobucci had simultaneously been retained as an attorney and lobbyist for SNC Lavalin.

The official announcement of Bruce’s departure from the firm came on June 11, 2019, the day after Bruce is said to have received advanced word that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been preparing to make the arrest. He is believed to have received that information from Kevin Lynch, SNC Lavalin’s Chairman and the former Clerk of the Privy Council.

Ian Edwards, who just joined the firm in January as its COO, with a career’s worth of experience in the oil and gas industry, was named to replace Bruce, effective that same Tuesday.

Lynch has since been cooperating with investigators and has been wearing a recording device at Board meetings since June, our sources say, at the request of investigators. He has been directed to cease communications with the Prime Minister’s Office, his personal phones are being monitored, and he has been directed not to disclose his cooperation publicly.


Lynch’s access to the PMO had been a subject of questioning by MPs earlier this year during the Justice Committee’s questioning of Michael Wernick, the former Clerk of the Privy Council.

The subject of that leak — a staffer inside the PMO — is now a target of the RCMP’s larger ongoing investigation, which includes at least two cooperators with active recording devices inside the office.

The Chronicle reported on Bruce’s wife’s hurried departure from Canada in March, and the quick sale of their $3 million home in the Westmont section of Montreal, following the public corruption scandal earlier this year. She returned to the United Kingdom shortly thereafter, despite retaining her employment position with Stephen Bronfman‘s Montreal-based private equity fund.

Bronfman was heavily interested in SNC Lavalin’s Libyan business dealings and he supported his cousin Sara Bronfman‘s efforts to install her husband as that nation’s first elected President. The Bronfmans have been the Liberal Party of Canada‘s chief financers for more than 100 years.


Basit Igtet, who had nearly been installed as President of Libya following a US military-backed ouster of Moummar Gadaffi, is married to Sara Bronfman.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

More criminals and pedo’s linked to the Canadian liberal party? It’s getting to be almost as exciting as like when Rosie O’Donnell came out of the closet. She seemed to be the only one who didn’t know. I wonder how they knew there was a warrant going to be issued? I wonder how old those “female companions” were Gaddafi jr got from SNC during his “stay” in Canada. I wonder how ONE company can single handed drop Canada’s corruption reputation to the WTO and still not face charges.

I used to love this country, now it’s a communist society that has no value or respect for the people, just numbers on a page to use in tax formulas to figure out just how far you can squeeze them before they squeak. Then take those tax dollars, give them to corrupt companies for “favours” and after the large cash injection lay off 1500 employees and pay big bonuses to ceo’s then obstruct justice and no one bats an eye.

Welcome to Chinada and we are in the cultural revolution apparently, if you hear anybody say “state farming” I give it another 3 years in liberal power before people start eating each other.

41,The Buffalo Chronicle ,"RCMP plans to charge Trudeau with obstruction in SNC Lavalin affair, following federal elections",10/17/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police intends to charge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his principal secretary Gerald Butts, and former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick with obstruction of justice related to their involvement in the SNC Lavalin affair, and subsequent efforts to conceal it from the public, a source inside the agency tells The Chronicle.

They intend to lay those charges “precisely two weeks” after the federal election on October 21. Any later would appear as though the victor of the election was influencing the action, and any sooner would suggest that the agency had an obligation to disclose how progressed its investigation had become prior to the election, the source posits.

It’s unclear if former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iaccobucci, a central figure in the scheme, will be among those arrested.

When the RCMP suspended its ongoing investigation early last month, they announced that it would resume following the federal election — but offered no other details that might have given voters a more informed political discourse, or an indication of how far the investigation has progressed.


Frank Iaccobucci was working for SNC Lavalin at the same time he was tasked by Trudeau to lead the government’s Trans Mountain Pipeline consultations with indigenous people in British Columbia. SNC Lavalin badly wanted that $7 billion infrastructure contract.

That decision was made months ago, in order to avoid actively surveilling the Prime Minister and his senior staff during the official election period. Some senior administrators are concerned about allegations of ‘spying’ on a campaign — a situation still playing out in the United States in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.

As such, those who have been cooperating with the investigation were instructed to stop recording conversations outside of the PMO between September 11 and October 21, in an effort to avoid capturing anything campaign-related.

The Chronicle is told that the RCMP has discovered that PMO staffers regularly use public resources — including phones, computers, and public time — to engage in campaign-related activities and to perform political tasks.

“Others involved in the conspiracy may be among those charged, like PMO staffers Mathieu Bouchard and Ben Chin, or Ministers Bill Morneau and Scott Brison,” he explains. “It depends entirely on how cooperative they’re going to be with their witness statements over the next two weeks.”


Investigators have been probing the dealings of Gerald Butts for months.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

If the Liberals win, Trudeau will quit and be replaced with another toady who will instantly let SNC walk away from the criminal charges. SNC will then be awarded the Trudeau pipeline which will then explode in costs, mainly from bribes to native bands, unions, Horgan’s NDP and the Tides financed enviro-fascists. Horgan will end up accepting all kinds of “fees” for permits and approvals, much which will end up in a personal numbered account in a local Communist Chinese Bank.

The horrendous cost over-runs will of course be covered by the Trudeau clone “in the interests of the Canadian economy” . Since Alberta and Sask oil will be crossing Provincial boundaries, Trudeau would likely nationalize it and sell it to his Communist Chinese friends at a horrible discount.

Elizabeth May will retire very wealthy in a UN position. Trudeau will end up as a highly paid “consultant” for SNC.

I don’t think my ideas are too far off what might be.

While I wonder if the RCMP is actually just another complicit bought and paid for organization. let us hope that the rule of law wins out here and Trudeau and crew are charged as stated in the article.

42,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Trudeau’s West Grey accuser was much younger than first thought,10/19/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Trudeau has become known for using classrooms as a backdrop for photo-opportunities.




Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s underage accuser was much younger at the time of their relationship than was first thought, her father tells The Chronicle. Some in the public discourse pegged the accusor at 17 years old. That is inaccurate.

“She was much, much younger than that,” the wealthy Canadian businessman told The Chronicle yesterday. He was not a party to the $2.25 million mutual non-disclosure non-disparagement agreement that she signed, in exchange for her continued silence, on the Wednesday evening of October 9th.

The terms of that agreement prevent both the accuser and Trudeau from acknowledging “any aspect” of that relationship, without triggering a six-to-seven-figure liquidated damages clause. That penalty starts at $500,000 and scales up, depending on the magnitude of the breach.



The accusor’s father shared with The Chronicle a password-protected digital copy of that agreement, giving us limited access to it for several hours on the condition we would make no copies and not distribute. Doing so could have jeopardized the terms of the agreement, which imposes damages on either party in the event they acknowledge or discuss the relationship publicly.

He does not believe his discussion of that agreement’s existence is a violation of its terms since he was not a party to it. He did not acquire the document from his daughter; it was incorrectly CC’d to him on an email between the negotiating parties.

The two engaged in a long and steamy affair on- and off-campus while Trudeau taught drama and French at Vancouver’s prestigious West Point Grey Academy. He was discovered by his accusor’s father at their family home, which prompted private demands to school administrators that he be removed from his position immediately.

“There was a ‘small settlement’ at the time,” he says, but declined to elaborate.

The relationship was discovered several months after Pierre Trudeau‘s death. He died on September 28th, and was eulogized by his son on October 3rd — an event that made him a rising political star, around whom much of Canada would swoon. His students were particularly fawning, friends say.



At the time, the family was told that the school’s standard employment agreement included confidentiality terms that would be binding on Trudeau after his departure. As a matter of policy, the school does not comment on personnel matters.

Trudeau’s friends at the time say that the typically outgoing and exuberant young man was suffering through a bout of depression following his father’s death in 2000, and his brother’s death in 1997. They postulate that anything improper was likely a result of his fragile emotional state at the time, not because of any nefarious character trait.

“He was lonely and depressed for months,” one friend told The Chronicle.

At the time, Canada’s age of consent was 14 years old.

In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper had that law changed, raising the age to 16, where the law sits today. Still, Canada outlaws sex between adults and people younger than 18 when the adult is in a position of responsibility for the wellbeing of that child.

Trudeau’s behavior would have been illegal at the time.

To date, Trudeau has not offered a public denial of The Buffalo Chronicle’s reporting. Instead, he has instructed his communications staffers to decline to answer those questions and to attack the credibility of this publication.

The Buffalo Chronicle has never — in our entire operating history — been sued for defamation or any other matter. We have never once received a cease and desist letter from the subjects of any article since we began publishing in 2014.

We have not received such a cease and desist letter from Mr. Trudeau.


Trudeau has used his relatively brief time as a teacher to shape his personal narrative when he first got into politics in 2008. He has used the experience to shape his political brand, often claiming to have ‘taught math’.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

1,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Trudeau operatives have been hounding Mark Zuckerberg to censor a US-based newspaper,10/20/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior figures in his government — including Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould — and several of his principal political operatives have been hounding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with appeals to censor a newspaper this week.

The Trudeau government repeatedly demanded that Zuckerberg remove The Buffalo Chronicle’s coverage of the Canadian federal elections from his social media platform. The Buffalo Chronicle is a New York-based newspaper owned by a Haudenosaunee businessman who is indigenous to both sides of the border and extensively covers indigenous politics in the United States and Canada.

Zuckerberg refused to remove The Chronicle’s content from his social media platform — but he has imposed technological restrictions on The Chronicle’s use of his platform.

In effect, Facebook is systematically discriminating against this publication — presumably for its center-right political views — by restricting our page’s functionality and access to tools that left-leaning publications enjoy with impunity.


MP Karina Gould is badly trailing her opponent in her Burlington riding, which some postulate has intensified the pressure she has been exerting on Facebook to censor a foreign media company.

These restrictions on The Chronicle’s Facebook functionality significantly reduce the organic reach of our content, make it more difficult for our audience to grow, and mitigate our ability to distribute content relative to other publications — who have more left-leaning political views.

When Trudeau officials pressured Facebook earlier this year to restrict the distribution of American news content in Canada, Facebook succumbed to the pressure. Zuckerberg has banned The Buffalo Chronicle from utilizing for-pay content distribution tools for political news journalism related to Canada’s federal or indigenous politics.

Both The New York Times and The Washington Post are still able to distribute such content into the Canadian marketplace utilizing those tools.

The Chronicle is considering a lawsuit.


On October 17, 2019, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered a thoughtful defense of free speech in public remarks at Georgetown University, though he did not acknowledge the unprecedented pressure that he has received from the Trudeau government.

In recent months, Trudeau has been furious that The Chronicle has published a series of jawdropping articles on his government. That series has called attention to the pervasive anti-Conservative and pro-Liberal media bias that exists in Canada, where the media industry is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Trudeau has expanded annual funding and subsidy programs for ‘news journalism’ to more than $1.6 billion annually.

The Chronicle has never been sued for defamation in our operating history. The publication has never received a cease-and-desist letter, from Mr. Trudeau or anyone else. We stand by our reporting and are confident in our sources. That’s particularly true as it relates to our coverage of Canadian politics this year.

Thank you for posting links to the articles. It appears my browser stopped receiving Canadian related articles from the Buffalo Chronicle (BC) as of April 2019. Not impressed! Luckily, another user on a different site posted a link to one of BC’s articles. Went to BC homepage, and Canada news this morning and was surprised to see how many articles were written of which I never saw before. Censorship is not just with FB (I don’t use FB).

The amount of political corruption we are experiencing in Canada is appalling. Disinformation is running amok. The MSM is so biased, the news is misleading or not shown at all. Sad I have to rely on foreign news sites for what’s going on in my own country.

43,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Will a weakened Trudeau be able to survive looming RCMP investigations,10/22/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the far-left New Democrats, has expressed his desire to form a government with Justin Trudeau. But some expect Trudeau to decline the offer in favor of forming a government with the Bloc Quebecois.




Despite losing the popular vote, Justin Trudeau is likely to retain his position as Prime Minister of Canada, though his Parliamentary caucus has been reduced to 155 seats in the House of Commons, short of the 170 seats needed to form a government.

Trudeau is likely to engage in talks this week with Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democrats, which has won 25 ridings; and Francois-Yves Blanchet, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, which has won 32 ridings.

Trudeau will need the support of at least one of those leaders to form a government.

In Canada, minority governments survive for fewer than two and half years.

But Trudeau’s government is the target of an ongoing investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; it was put on hold just prior to the election being called. Political operatives expect charges for obstruction of justice to be brought against Trudeau in the coming weeks — and without majority control of the House, he will be unable to shut down the oversight functions of either the Justice Committee or the Ethics Committee.

With an emboldened Conservative Party, having gained 26 seats this cycle to win 121 seats, the opposition can be expected to use those committees to dig more deeply in the SNC Lavalin public corruption scandal, and ethical breaches related to the PMO’s handling of the affair.


All eyes are on Andrew Scheer’s next moves. The Conservative Party won the popular vote.

Andrew Scheer indicated that he intends to stay on as Leader of the Conservative Party, despite falling short of hopes at forming a government this election. On election night, Scheer told supporters that the Conservative Party will be ready to pounce when the Trudeau government falls.

Political observers are closely watching Scheer’s next moves. Election results made clear that the Conservatives must address regional policy and messaging strategies in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, and Ontario — where the party had been hoping to make stronger gains.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

andrew scheer makes a great “Master of Ceremonies” at Your Sister’s Wedding. Truly lacks Leadership Quality. And it is proven that the Electorate would rather have a Stuffed Puppet who can regurgitate Gerald Butts Theme Park Politics. For all the negative and pending charges, it was Scheers’ to lose…. And he did, in a repetitive, monotonous, lack luster spew, of “he’s not fit to Govern” ….for 40 days, every day or infinity is more like it. Did it work?

Had not the Quebec Separatists dredged up the Movement, one more time, Trudeau would have won another Majority. They took over 37 out of the 78 seats. And that is where popular vote for the Liberals dropped and then an…. increased dose of Love in the 905.
Was not Scheer supposed to shine in the 905?

Scheer cannot hang his hat on winning popular vote. Peter McKay is the only future Leader, that can deal with Trudeau. Not Ambrose. And for what its worth our Country’s portion of global carbon is pegged at 1.5%………So if we cut the foot print in half ….is only 0.75% or 99.25% Remains at large.
Of all the Elections that I have endured, including Pierre Trudeau, this one has the least substance, with no lack of spending and no way of paying for it. And outright lies, with no facts to back up.
But don’t let “Campaign” facts get in the way.

Canadians owe $1.79 for every dollar earned.

44,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Does the Bloc Quebecois have a window of opportunity in Donald Trump’s presidency,10/23/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"Some political operatives believe that President Donald J. Trump‘s tenure in office is creating a window of opportunity for the Nation of Quebec to engage in direct trade talks with the United States, in the context of the USMCA trade treaty, which has not yet been ratified by the parties.

Trump’s ‘pro-patriotism’ and ‘anti-globalist’ worldview is largely congruent with the Bloc Quebecois — which advocates for Quebec’s status as a ‘nation within a federation,’ a governance structure in which Quebec and Canada are seen as equal partners.

Under Justin Trudeau‘s leadership, succession movements have been shaking the Canadian federation — and a second Trudeau term could push Canada into a new constitutional convention, forced to addresses ‘equalization’ policies, which have inflamed regional tensions in recent months.

Equalization is central to Canada’s 1982 constitution and was required to convince Quebec to join the federation, though Quebec has never signed that Constitution. It requires Alberta, with its large oil and gas industry, to transfer billions to poorer provinces.


Francois Legault is the Premier of Quebec. He leads the Coalition Avenir Québec, a political party he founded in 2011.

Quebec has received more than 50% of all equalization payments since the program’s inception in the late 1950s, totaling more than 221 billion. Equalization payments are unconditional – receiving provinces are free to spend the funds according to their own priorities. The program is intended to equalize service delivery between wealthy provinces with high taxing capacity and poorer, less developed provinces with a limited ability to raise revenues.

Regional politics and disparate economic interests exacerbate political tensions on a largely regional basis. A revived Bloc Quebecois has gained 22 seats in yesterday’s Parliamentary election, bringing the successionist party’s seat total to 32 — more than enough to offer Trudeau a governing coalition.

Trudeau’s tenure has ignited a sovereignty movement in the Western interior provinces that has become known as ‘Wexit‘. Polling in recent months shows that nearly half of all Albertans support independence from Canada — largely because of the Trudeau government’s inability to construct the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which would have tripled production capacity in the Alberta oil sands.


Francois Blanchet leads the Bloc Quebecois in Parliament.

That delayed project has left thousands of construction workers in the unemployment line — with the province’s unemployment rate hovering upwards of 7% since the global drop in oil prices in 2014.

Given Alberta’s preference for low-income taxes, the province has been enduring multi-billion dollar deficits under former Premier Rachel Notley, a New Democrat who was ousted from power in a landslide election earlier this year.

Resource wealthy provinces like Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland are typically ‘have provinces’ that transfer more than $18 billion a year ($11.7 billion of which went to Quebec), and the Trudeau government is expected to increase those transfers to $22 billion by 2022.

The situation has led to mass resentment. Because Alberta’s GDP is boosted so significantly by its resource industries, a downturn in employment hasn’t benefited the province in the context of the equalization formula. Premier Jason Kenny has been calling for reforms — or perhaps even the elimination of the equalization system altogether.

Exacerbating tensions are environmentalists in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia who are staunchly opposed to any new pipelines, especially those that serve the oil sands, where crude processing is far more carbon-intensive than off-shore drilling.

With the Trump administration inclined to support self-governance movements abroad (like Brexit), the USMCA not yet ratified, and an emboldened independence movement in the West — is this the moment that Quebec has been waiting for?","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

Exact. Here’s a deal that will make an historic power shift to the conservative that Trudeau can’t prevent;

The referendum on equalization give an opportunity for all conservatives provinces to take back what was in there jurisdictions : the power on direct taxation

One have to know that the equalization program was set (1954) to replace the shortage of revenue due to the fact that the provinces have give to Ottawa the jurisdiction on direct taxation for war effort. Ottawa did nt turn it back after the war.

Quebec have fight the federal to get it back : Duplessis , got 10 % and Lesage a bit to, continue by Daniel Johnson (1967).

All the conservative provinces should consider to take a cue on Quebec in order to stop feeding the beast (federal) if they want to have it more slim (witch is the goal of the conservative) :

Tracking the federal government’s finances since Confederation

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/tracking-the-federal-governments-finances-since-confederation/article35505322/

REVENUE

From 1867 to 1913, the lion’s share of the federal government’s revenue came from

customs duties. Then, during the First World War, the war effort demanded new

revenue sources, resulting in the introduction of personal income, corporate and sales

taxes. Personal income tax went on to become the single-most important stream
of revenue and is expected to account for about 51 per cent of total revenue this year.

Quebec likes the freedoms that independence gives but hates that independence means “make your own money”. By this logical and political fallacy they wouldn’t last 6 months as an independent state. Quebec’s financial system is one of the oldest in North America, but still can’t operate without billions in handouts and handholds.
Besides that point, they have yet to sign on the charter and as such should not have any rights or financial help as a confederate partner.

That’s why Wexit is a deal, constant pandering to Quebec from Ottawa and all the payments come from the west.
Take some advice from the Doc, cut out the cancer before it takes over.

45,The Buffalo Chronicle ,Wilson-Raybould is planning a ‘constitutional reform caucus’ in Parliament — and Scheer may endorse it,10/25/19 0:00,The Buffalo Chronicle ,,"The newly re-elected Member of Parliament for Vancouver-Granville, Jody Wilson-Raybould — the only non-partisan person elected to the 43rd Parliament — wants to bring constitutional and electoral reform to Canada. To do it, a source tells The Chronicle, she is planning to launch a high-profile non-partisan caucus, open to all Members of Parliament, and tasked with the objective of democratizing Canada.

Wilson-Raybould is expected to push for election reforms and a ‘democratization of the Senate’. Some suspect she may even push for the direct election of the Governor-General and Province-wide elections to select members of the Senate on a fixed calendar.


Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was unable to secure a majority in the House of Commons, raising the unlikely prospect that legislative initiatives might be advanced without the endorsement of his government — putting him in a tenuous position. The leaders of the three largest opposition parties are on record in support of electoral reforms, broadly.

In the Canadian lexicon, a ‘parliamentary caucus’ usually refers to a party’s collective membership in the elected House of Commons and the appointed Senate. Wilson-Raybould’s use of the term, in a non-partisan context and organized around a specific objective, could be a forum through which the Independent member can bring opposition parties together in advancing legislation that is unendorsed by the governing Liberal Party.

The source imagines that the “Constitutional Reform Caucus” is likely to evolve into a think tank (he suggests that it would be “the Brookings Institution of Canada”), funded by charitable contributions from Canadians, and perhaps even led by former cabinet Minister Jane Philpott.


Phillpot and Wilson-Raybould already have enormous fundraising prowess — and support for democratic reforms cuts across partisan lines. Observers say that they could easily fundraise an endowment that could support the ongoing operations of an Ottawa-based think tank.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer may endorse the caucus — and, word has it, that he’d even like to co-Chair it, with Wilson-Raybould. Imagine the optics: the Conservative Party leader working with the Leader-in-Waiting of the Liberal Party, advancing transformational reform legislation that decentralizes power and vests it more firmly in the electorate.

The optics alone could be enough to destabilize a Trudeauvian government.


Opposition leader Andrew Scheer would like to work with Wilson-Raybould — who is widely seen as the Liberal Party’s Leader-in-Waiting — during the 43rd Parliament.","<div class=""entry-content clearfix"">

The liberals have to many seats for that to be effective form of opposition with the variation in opposition parties policy currently. The conservatives plus the bloc plus NDP to pass. They would get no media attention in Canada and would be rendered ineffective as such. I’m probably wrong though as I though we were a democrat confederation not that long ago.
