<blockquote class=""tr_bq"">
The word â€œaffordableâ€� appeared some thirty-one times in the <a href=""https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2016_DNC_Platform.pdf"">2016 Democratic Party platform</a>,
 in reference to policy areas ranging from housing and college tuition 
to childcare and finance (for comparison, â€œmiddle class,â€� that hallowed 
floating signifier, appeared only sixteen times).<br>
<br>
Its omnipresence in political language makes a certain intuitive 
sense. Life for many Americans is, after all, dominated by institutions 
that make things more expensive by design: health insurers offering 
pricey packages for even the most basic coverage; telecom and energy 
giants imposing inscrutable new rates and fees on customers trying to 
maintain their cell service, keep the lights on, or not freeze to death 
in the winter; schools making themselves ever more exclusive through 
higher tuition; landlords raising the rents at each and every 
opportunity.<br>
...<br>
Pushes to make vital public goods such as health care or education 
â€œaffordableâ€� â€” whether well-intentioned or deliberately misleading â€” 
still invariably imply a transaction taking place between a seller and a
 consumer: the dynamic of the market in its most elemental form. Even if
 the good in question <em>does</em> become cheaper (and therefore easier
 for more people to access), the basic dynamic is maintained and the 
good remains a commodity to be bought and sold rather than a universal 
right to be guaranteed and enjoyed.<br>
<br>
This is what makes the incrementalist attitude to health care (and 
innumerable other policy areas) favored by some Democrats so flawed: the
 Leftâ€™s push for universality isnâ€™t just a more holistic version of 
liberal efforts that aspire to make things more â€œaffordable.â€� Its 
ultimate goal is to democratize social goods, removing the market 
altogether and extinguishing the need for anyone to worry about whether 
they have the requisite funds to see a doctor, acquire education, put 
their children in a safe and caring environment during working hours, or
 sleep with a roof over their heads.</blockquote>

Alex Hemingway rightly <a href=""https://www.policynote.ca/corporate-medicine-in-urgent-care-centres/"">questions</a> the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority's eagerness to introduce corporate control into the health care system. And Sharon Riley <a href=""https://thenarwhal.ca/15-minute-approvals-alberta-plans-to-automate-licences-for-new-oil-and-gas-drilling/"">exposes</a> how Alberta may soon be automating the licensing process for oil and 
gas wells, ensuring that no human being evaluates the safety and 
environmental concerns raised by their use.<br>
<br>
- Meanwhile, Don Pittis <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/green-energy-economy-1.5143757"">offers</a> a reminder that clean energy already offers more opportunity for workers than dirty fossil fuels - and this before any level of government has planned out a meaningful transition from the latter to the former.<br>

- Finally, Michael Harris <a href=""https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2019/05/23/Early-Voters-Guide/"">writes</a> that we should neither put up with Justin Trudeau's contempt for social and environmental justice, nor buy for a second the view that Andrew Scheer is an acceptable (or the only) alternative.

And even the most prominent attempt to introduce a values debate to discussion of Canada's oil sector was one which ( however falsely ) tried to distinguish oil production by location, not to sanctify the concept of fossil fuel production itself.  But now, an increasing proportion of the electorate recognizes the need to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels which all parties including the federal Conservatives  once accepted .

The obvious results of the campaign even in its infancy include the eager adoption of the religious language by right-wing  commentators  - in some cases coupled with an  attempt  to set up false sectarian wars.

The party doesnâ€™t include much detail yet but estimates it could generate several billion dollars a year. Pundits have been quick to pounce on a wealth tax as too extreme, difficult or costly. A National Post column last month asked: â€œWhat is the problem to which creating a wealth tax is a solution?â€� Growing inequality is the problem. The richest families in Canada are now more than 4,400 times wealthier than the average family, according to a study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA). This widening gap has gone hand-in-hand with declining social and economic mobility. The CCPA found that family dynasties are more likely to keep their money in the family than they were two decades ago thanks to light taxes and loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, while Statistics Canada recently reported that family income mobility has declined since the 1980s. ... Thereâ€™s debate among economists about the pros and cons of annual wealth taxes, and whether inheritance taxes and other taxes on capital and wealth would work better. Canadians for Tax Fairness, an organization that advocates for fair and progressive taxation, has called for restoring an inheritance tax on high-wealth estates to narrow Canadaâ€™s widening wealth gap, make our tax system fairer and generate funds to pay for public services. Democratic leadership contender and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a similar plan to expand the estate tax for inheritances over US$3.5 million. The question and debate should no longer be whether we have increased taxes on wealth and capital, but what form they should take. We should thank the NDP for getting this debate going in Canada, and look forward to seeing what other federal political parties propose. - And Douglas Todd  notes  that a failure to adequately tax wealth as opposed to income has left British Columbia in the position of subsidizing foreign ownership of desperately scarce housing.   - Melanie Green  offers  some important background information as a British Columbia inquiry begins analyzing the cause of soaring gas prices being used by right-wing politicians to attach carbon pricing. Paul Cowley  reports  on another estimate showing that Alberta faces tens of billions of dollars in well reclamation liabilities left unfunded by the corporations who have extracted oil and gas. And Andrea Palframan  reports  on the work of the Heiltsuk Nation in documenting the lack of any effective oil spill response along B.C.'s coastline.   - Paul Wells  writes  that Andrew Scheer's anti-Canada Food Guide bombast can only be the product of a politician taking voters for idiots. And the Star's editorial board  argues  that we shouldn't allow anybody to play political with health and nutrition.   - Finally, Rick Salutin  points out  the sheer folly of Doug Ford's insistence that Ontario students earn online credits rather than receiving a full education at school.

<blockquote class=""tr_bq"">
Canadaâ€™s NDP has proposed a one per cent tax on wealth over $20 million as part of its election platform. The party doesnâ€™t include much detail yet but estimates it could generate several billion dollars a year.<br><br>Pundits have been quick to pounce on a wealth tax as too extreme, difficult or costly. A National Post column last month asked: â€œWhat is the problem to which creating a wealth tax is a solution?â€�<br><br>Growing inequality is the problem.<br><br>The richest families in Canada are now more than 4,400 times wealthier than the average family, according to a study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA).<br><br>This widening gap has gone hand-in-hand with declining social and economic mobility. The CCPA found that family dynasties are more likely to keep their money in the family than they were two decades ago thanks to light taxes and loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, while Statistics Canada recently reported that family income mobility has declined since the 1980s.<br>
...<br>
Thereâ€™s debate among economists about the pros and cons of annual wealth taxes, and whether inheritance taxes and other taxes on capital and wealth would work better. Canadians for Tax Fairness, an organization that advocates for fair and progressive taxation, has called for restoring an inheritance tax on high-wealth estates to narrow Canadaâ€™s widening wealth gap, make our tax system fairer and generate funds to pay for public services. Democratic leadership contender and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a similar plan to expand the estate tax for inheritances over US$3.5 million.<br><br>The question and debate should no longer be whether we have increased taxes on wealth and capital, but what form they should take. We should thank the NDP for getting this debate going in Canada, and look forward to seeing what other federal political parties propose.</blockquote>
- And Douglas Todd <a href=""https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-why-we-need-to-stop-subsidizing-foreign-ownership-of-metro-housing"">notes</a> that a failure to adequately tax wealth as opposed to income has left British Columbia in the position of subsidizing foreign ownership of desperately scarce housing. <br>
<br>
- Melanie Green <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2019/07/15/what-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-british-columbias-gas-prices-probe.html"">offers</a> some important background information as a British Columbia inquiry begins analyzing the cause of soaring gas prices being used by right-wing politicians to attach carbon pricing. Paul Cowley <a href=""https://www.reddeeradvocate.com/news/oil-and-gas-well-cleanup-costs-could-hit-65-billion-industry-watchdog-group/"">reports</a> on another estimate showing that Alberta faces tens of billions of dollars in well reclamation liabilities left unfunded by the corporations who have extracted oil and gas. And Andrea Palframan <a href=""https://briarpatchmagazine.com/blog/view/heiltsuk-nation-nathan-e-stewart-oil-spill-response"">reports</a> on the work of the Heiltsuk Nation in documenting the lack of any effective oil spill response along B.C.'s coastline. <br>
<br>

And the Star's editorial board <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2019/07/19/andrew-scheer-shouldnt-play-politics-with-canadas-food-guide.html"">argues</a> that we shouldn't allow anybody to play political with health and nutrition. <br>
<br>
- Finally, Rick Salutin <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/07/18/is-requiring-four-online-courses-the-weirdest-thing-doug-ford-has-done.html"">points out</a> the sheer folly of Doug Ford's insistence that Ontario students earn online credits rather than receiving a full education at school.

Maxime Bernier has only exacerbated Stephen Harper's past anti-minority messages, building his PPC campaign largely on criticism of immigration generally.

Maxime Bernier has only exacerbated Stephen Harper's past anti-minority messages, building his PPC campaign largely on criticism of immigration generally. <br>

But it's worth looking at a case study as to how the Harper Cons flouted any distinction between private member's bills and government bills when it suited their purposes.  Bill C-377, designed to impose reporting requirements on unions which don't apply to any other organization, was never included in any Con election platform. It was introduced as a private member's bill by Russ Heibert to make use of an advantageous draw in the order of priority, while avoiding the scrutiny that applies to government bills.  But the Senate returned it to the House of Commons with amendments. And at that point, the Cons  made clear  that it was Stephen Harper, not any MP acting on behalf of any constituents, who was dictating what to do with the legislation - and moreover that reintroducing it as a government bill was on the table:  Despite this being a private memberâ€™s bill, the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office has been moved to issue a statement.   We continue to support union transparency and the principles of the bill, which will be returned to the House as part of the normal process.  As per Parliamentary convention, we expect that the Senate will respect the will of the House of Commons should the Bill be returned to the Senate. A Conservative source  tells  the Canadian Press that the bill will now be reintroduced as a government bill. That didn't happen in the House of Commons. But it did eventually happen in the Senate, as Harper's Cons  broke the Senate's rules  to retroactively reclassify C-377 as a ""government bill"" to allow it to be rammed through in the final session before the 2015 election:  The government has powerful tools to push forward on ""government business"" â€” important legislation such as budgets. But C-377 falls under ""other business"" because it is a private member's bill from a Conservative backbench MP.  Carignan wanted to have C-377 declared a government bill so that he could force it to a vote. The problem is that it clearly isn't government business. The government itself introduced it as ""other business.""  A government motion would have retroactively redefined C-377 as a government bill. This was the motion Speaker Housakos declared was against the rules and undermined the traditions of the Senate.  By overruling Housakos, government senators can now use tools intended for government bills to push forward a private member's bill that many have warned is unconstitutional. In light of that background, what does Scheer have to say about anti-choice legislation?  Scheerâ€™s  efforts to clarify  his views on abortion just made things murkier. â€œI will not re-open this debate and I will oppose any plan to re-open this debate,â€� he told reporters.  But he also said Conservative MPs would be allowed to introduce legislation limiting access to abortion. And to vote for restricting access, if that was their personal view. And while he would expect cabinet ministers to vote against limiting access, he wouldnâ€™t demand they do. So Scheer's supposed acceptance of the continued availability of abortion is limited to personally opposing a move to ""re-open"" debate. But that can be done by any MP introducing a private member's bill. And Scheer has signalled his willingness to permit that step within a party which  exercises strict control  over those bills in the first place - meaning that he'll be providing tacit approval even if he feigns public dismay.  And once that step has been taken? Scheer won't demand that any of his MPs vote to preserve the right to abortion access. And based on his own words, any step after the first one has been left open.  There's thus every reason for concern that Scheer will follow his predecessor's playbook. And any promise to leave the Cons' dirty work to private member's bills should only be taken as a reminder that they've used that mechanism to grease the skids for controversial legislation before.
