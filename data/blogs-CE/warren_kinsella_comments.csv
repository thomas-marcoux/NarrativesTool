for Justin Trudeau during his most trying time as prime minister The Georgia Straight Tuesday March 12 2019 By Charlie Smith Rightwing bloggers love to portray Justin Trudeau as the devil but hes actually a nice Catholic boy with the best of intentions He loves his wife He loves his children And he truly believes that theres strength in diversity But like all of us Trudeau slips up from time to time And never so badly as when he and the fixers in his office thought that it was a good idea to try to prevent SNCLavalin from being convicted of a criminal offence But even a good Catholic can give in to temptation if the stakes are high enough And with his prime ministers position on the line the Straight has learned that hes been consulting with the devil himself for political advice An unnamed source in Hell has provided us with the transcript of one of these conversations You can read it below Justin I know Im not supposed to talk to you but Im truly fucked right now because of the Globe and Mail Any advice Lucifer You could quit Justin Im not a quitter Besides that would give that twerp Scheer just what he wants Lucifer So you want me to save your ass Justin Uh yes Lucifer Are you prepared to listen to what I say Justin Yes Lucifer Youre a fucking idiot Justin What are you talking about Im the prime minister of Canada Lucifer So far youve done everything wrong The maximum shelf life of any major news story should be no more than three weeks Even the clamouring over the death of Prince Diana pretty much ended after three weeks This is the fifth week of SNCLavalin leading the news Youre in so deep youll need an excavation crew to get you out Im tempted to call in those dive teams who got those Thai kids out of that cave Justin If youre so smart tell me what Ive done wrong Lucifer First off you thought you were so powerful that you didnt need to suck up to the Canadian media You gave everything to Netflix Amazon Facebook Google and the CBC You thought that by pandering to the digital giants it would help you in trade talks with Trump But that totally destroyed the Globe and Mail CTV the Toronto Star Postmedia and Globalas well as its owners the Shaw family Theyre never going to drop the SNCLavalin story now Justin What are you talking about Morneau is handing over 600 million to those bastards Lucifer Thats chump change to Thomson and Godfrey And its over five years for fuck sakes They smell weakness just like they did when you went to India This is their opportunity to get Scheer elected Justin I dont know what youre talking about Lucifer David Thomson might be the richest man in Canada but hes seriously ticked over the amount of money hes losing on the Globe But he cant sell it because hell look like a doofus to all those people who thought his dad was a great newspaper proprietor Justin What about Godfrey Lucifer Hes so pissed that his newspapers have to compete with CBC for digital ads And Scheer has promised to privatize the CBC You never think about these things do you Youre such a moron sometimes Chrtien had Kinsella in his officehe understood media Who have you relied on Gardner Jesus Murphy Justin Whats wrong with Gardner Lucifer He thinks hes a goddamned professor No wonder youre so fucked Kinsella was a streetfighter He would have gotten you out of this situation by turning the attention on Scheer But you were too pure to rely on his advice Everyone in Ottawa knows you have trust issues with anyone born before 1970 except for Morneau and Goodale The Globe stuck it to you because you made it so easy If Fife could take down Stephen Harper over the Duffy scandal you were going to be a piece of cake Justin Why me Lucifer Fifes bosses hate you because you kissed Zuckerbergs ass You kissed Googles ass You kissed Netflixs ass Evan Solomons bosses hate you for the same reason And that Mercedes Stephenson is a secret right winger Global was glad when Vassy bolted for CBC It put someone from Calgary in the drivers seat Justin How did I get into this mess with the media Lucifer Hedy Fry showed you a way out but you ignored her The heritage committee gave you the blueprint Shes won eight goddamned elections Justin Is this why the Globe keeps nailing me Lucifer Its not the only reason The newsroom is filled with libertarians Ill let you in on something though Crawley the publisher was hooting when he saw the print edition on February 7 detailing what you did to WilsonRaybould He quipped just not ready Justin Trudeau has been making all the wrong moves as he tries to dig himself out of political trouble over SNCLavalin Justin Okay I get it I need to improve on media relations What else Lucifer Your thirdparty endorsers are for the most part a disaster Jonathan Wilkinson Good god nobody even knows who he is He looks like the type of guy who would shut down a GM plant Sheila Copps Why did you bring out that old retread Did you seriously think she was going to influence anyone by trashing Jody WilsonRaybould Its made her a martyr But the worst is Christy Clark By far I cant imagine what made you think she would help your cause Just because shes a woman isnt going to help you with female voters especially in BC Youre so sophomoric Justin Justin Are any my endorsers working for me Lucifer Carla Qualtroughs okay Shes got this sexy librarian look that works on TV and she has a brain Men like her and women like her But nobody really knows who the hell she is Plus shes going to get slaughtered in the next election Garneau isnt bad either But the reality is that you have to aim far higher Justin Who should be speaking up for me Lucifer You need Alisters People with a reputation for integrity Paul Martin Bob Rae Sheila Fraser Kevin Page Jody found herself a Supreme Court judge and shes got Mary Ellen TurpelLafond in her camp Plus the most respected Indigenous leaders in the country Who have you got Sheila Copps on the line from Mexico Game set and match Justin Rae wont help me Hes still pissed because I wouldnt tell him that I was planning on seeking the Liberal leadership when he was interim leader Lucifer Come to think of it you really did stab him in the back He could have been prime minister Page and Fraser wont help you either But Martin might Justin I was thinking that maybe Ryan Reynolds or Michael Bubl could be of assistance Lucifer Dont be a dunce That will just get you ridiculed on Saturday Night Live Play to your strengths Get photographed with icons in different ethnic communities Herb Dhaliwal Patrick Chan People like that Youll show up in the Chinese and Indian media outlets and it might prevent more of your MPs from pulling a Jane Philpott on you Justin You have far better advice than Gerry Butts ever gave me What else should I know Lucifer You really chose a stupid cabinet I figured that you and Gerry picked some people based on how they look on TV That might have worked for a couple of weeks in 2015 but what did you get in the end Morneau Monsef ORegan McKenna Joly Kent Hehr Ive never seen this many featherweights in a federal cabinet since your dad was prime minister Justin Gerry Katie and Wernick told me that if I put rookies in it would make it easier to control things from the centre Lucifer That works only if the centre has a brain But Wernick is too stupid for words Who the fuck goes before a parliamentary committee and tries to change the subject by talking about political assassinations It would be laughable if it wasnt so pathetic By the way youve got to fire Wernick if you want this scandal to die down The public wants a corpse and for you to show that you realize what you did was wrong Justin But Wernick is there to help me give the corporations what they want with Indigenous people These companies need access to resources That was my twopronged strategy Gerry and I dreamed this up back in 2011 when we were meeting with Manley and Carr Put an Indigenous person in a highprofile cabinet post Talk a good game about this being the most important relationship But make certain that corporations have access to resources to keep the stock market up and ensure the Canada Pension Plan makes a good return It was working perfectly until Jody started raising hell about SNCLavalin Lucifer Yeah but Jody is smart She put two and two together and realized that when you bought the Trans Mountain pipeline system it was about giving more work to SNCLavalin Justin Who should I have put in cabinet Lucifer David McGuinty Judy Sgro Wayne Easter Arif Virani Joyce Murray Adam Vaughan Anthony Housefather I could give you more names if you like Justin No Thats enough Where do I go from here Lucifer Read Martyn Browns column on Straightcom He knows what hes talking about He says you have to bring WilsonRaybould back into cabinet as the attorney general Its the only way people will trust you Justin Who is Martyn Brown Never heard of him Lucifer He only managed to get Gordon Campbell elected three times as BC premier One of them was the biggest landslide in Canadian history But of course I recognize that youre not a big readerand Browns articles sometimes run for 6000 or even 10000 words But pay attention to what hes saying It just might help you keep your job Justin I dont have time to read Give me the Coles Notes version Lucifer You have to say youre sorry You have to admit you made a mistake by interfering in a criminal prosecution You have to let Jody WilsonRaybould tell the whole truth to the justice committee Otherwise youre toast Justin I think I can win the next election without doing that There was no inappropriate pressure put on WilsonRaybould Thats our line and were sticking with it Besides Scheer and Jagmeet Singh dont have a chance against me Lucifer You just dont get it First you said the Globe story was false Then your flunkies admitted it was true to the justice committee As this story stays in the news more of your MPs will start

only suspended while the election campaign is on Fred from BC says  September 11 2019 at 724 pm Damnyou just cant stop yourself can you Darwin Trump Derangement Syndrome has an unbreakable grip on you and you dont even know it It was clear that Mueller couldnt charge Trump with anything because of the Justice Department policy not to charge a sitting president Oh please Mueller couldnt charge Trump with anything because he found NOTHING to charge him with He did his very best to charge everyone remotely connected to Trumps campaign with minor process crimes in a futile attempt to justify his investigation but failed utterly in connecting Donald Trump to any Russian collusion although strangely he somehow failed to pursue any of the real Russian collusion he found involving the Clinton campaignalong with the illegal campaign finance misdirection that paid for the fake dossier Hmmm Trump didnt fully cooperate  And WHY SHOULD HE With Meuller stacking his investigative staff with as many partisan Democrats as he could find veering off on every possible tangent that steered well clear of any Democratic wrongdoing but managed to dredge up petty bullshit like Stormy Daniels and her sleazebag lawyer why in the hell would he grant Robert Mueller ANYTHING He didnt do the requested facetoface interview  GOOD I wouldnt have either He knew Mueller was so desperate to save face that he would have dredged up any potentially embarrassing incidents he could find no matter how completely unrelated to the original investigation they were Good move by Trump to leave that smarmy prick twiting in the wind Mueller listed several cases where Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation More misdirection Donald Trump could actually have shut down the socalled investigation any time he wanted but didnt Like Ive said a number of times before you and your kind appear to have learned nothing from your repeated failures to smear Trump the more you try the more people you drive into his camp Now youre just embarrassing yourselfand of course HELPING HIM GET REELECTED in the process As much as I dont care for the man and would love to see him defeated the American public now finds the Democrats and their useful idiots to be even more abhorrent than Trump check his numbers they are going up for a reason despite the fact that you people are so utterly unable to understand why I cant wait to laugh at you all when he gets a second term THANKS TO YOU It will almost be worth it Ronald ODowd says  September 12 2019 at 1102 am Fred I dont know about you but Im squarely in the Scaramucci camp Trump is clearly already incapacitated and hes doesnt have the luxury of having been reelected like Reagan was when he became dysfunctional IMHO theres no way in hell that hes up to the rigours of the 2020 campaign so I expect hell eventually give way to Pence who supposedly is now more popular than Trump doconnor says  September 12 2019 at 500 pm If the Department of Justice policy on charging the president had nothing to do with not charging him why does Mueller have a large section of his report going over the policy You are aware that the dossier originated with Republican opponents of Trump While the dossier contains information from Russian intelligence there is no reason to believe they cooperated with it or offered it up willing Fully cooperating would have made him seem less guilty in the eyes of the public and Congress Fred from BC says  September 12 2019 at 552 pm  IMHO theres no way in hell that hes up to the rigours of the 2020 campaign so I expect hell eventually give way to Pence who supposedly is now more popular than Trump I wouldnt bet against you on that Ronald As much as I despise a guy like Micheal Moore I have to admit that was right about Trumps election being the biggest political FUCK YOU in American history and that he may have been right about Trump never expecting to win the election in the first place  Being US President is a tough and thankless job why would a 70yearold billionaire need that when he could be out screwing porn stars not to mention whatever the hell else one can do with that kind of money and unlimited free time I hope he allows Pence to take over The man is a bit too religious for my tastes but at least hes softspoken polite and doesnt live for Twitter likes Johnny Librano says  September 10 2019 at 1153 pm Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod said the decision not to offer a broader waiver for the RCMP was made solely by the Clerk of the Privy Council as guardian of cabinet
