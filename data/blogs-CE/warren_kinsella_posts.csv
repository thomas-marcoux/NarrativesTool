678,Warren Kinsella,Jagmeet Singh and the first Kinsellian Political Rule™,2019-01-10 08:48:00,Warren,,"The puzzle that is Jagmeet Singh: what are we to do with you, Jagmeet?

Andrew Coyne has a typically thoughtful piece in today’s National Post about the erstwhile New Democratic leader. Mr. Coyne:

It is safe to say Singh has not proved quite the rock star New Democrats hoped when they elected him leader in October 2017. Undertaker would be closer to the mark. While the party trundles along at a little under 17 per cent in the polls, about its historic average, Singh himself is in single digits, slightly behind Elizabeth May as Canadians’ choice for prime minister.

Singh’s trajectory is a cautionary tale on the importance of experience in politics. With just six years in the Ontario legislature, Singh was barely ready for the job of provincial leader, still less the much sharper scrutiny to which federal leaders are subject. It has showed.

He appears frequently to be poorly briefed, on one memorable occasion having to ask a member of caucus, in full view of the cameras, what the party position was on a particular issue. He badly mishandled what should have been a softball question on where he stood on Sikh terrorism, and alienated many in the party with his knee-jerk expulsion of Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir for what appeared to be no worse a crime than standing too close to women at parties.

I write about him in next week’s Hill Times, too. This what I say:

Jagmeet Singh is the worst federal party leader since Stockwell Day. He has led his party to historic lows in public opinion. And his political instincts – as seen in his caucus relations, his policy stands, and his byzantine approach to securing seat in the House of Commons – are non-existent.

So, we’re all agreed on one point: Jagmeet Singh has been a disaster.

Another point of agreement: the Conservatives tend to win when the NDP do better than they’re doing under Singh’s reign of error. Conversely, the Liberals tend to win when the NDP do what they’re doing now, which is dropping like a proverbial stone. That’s a Canadian political truism.

Anyway, those are the points of agreement. Where I diverge with Professor Coyne is here: I divine no logic – none – in the way the parties are treating the Burnaby South by-election. Unlike the learned Coyne, I cannot observe the outlines of any brilliant strategy at work, here. To wit:If the Liberals really thought Singh was a disaster, why have they taken so bloody long to call the by-election in Burnaby? Why haven’t they extended the “leader’s courtesy,” like the Greens have, and pledge not to run someone against him? Why not get him in the House, to further advertise his failings?
If the Conservatives really wanted to help the New Democrats out, why are they even contesting the by-election? Why not make his life easier, instead of harder? Do they really think they’re in any way assisted by Singh being marked up – or defeated – in a nasty by-election contest, thereby throwing the Dippers into further leadership chaos in the 200-plus days remaining until the October election? (Similarly, if the Cons think a new and better leader is warranted, who would that be? Why do they think that guy – Messrs. Cullen or Angus, I surmise – would do any better? I don’t.)
If the New Democratsreally wanted to get their act together, why the sweet Jesus did they let their leader even contest Burnaby, where they’re in third place – instead of Singh’s hometown of Brampton, which he easily won, and represented, for years?

None of it makes any sense to me. It’s all stupid. Unlike Mr. Coyne, I can attribute no grand strategic vision to any of this. It’s a shambles, for all the parties. And it recalls the very first Kinsellian Political Rule™:

“Why haven’t they extended the “leader’s courtesy,” like the Greens have, and pledge not to run someone against him?”

There was a period that it seemed like the Liberals wouldn’t run someone against him, the reason I think they did is because they feared the real reason they were doing so was because Singh is such an anchor for the NDP, would be too obvious and the NDP would find another way to be rid of him.

It’s still a huge political miscalculation that could if things go right for the NDP backfire on the Liberals because the NDP can’t help but go up if we dump Singh.

Coyne is wrong that the delay in calling it makes it more difficult for the nds to replace Singh. Six months is plenty of time. It also will generate some publicity especially if a better leader comes to the fore.

Don’t discount the possibility that the cpc May quietly urge their supporters to vote LPC. But I’m not sure Singh won’t lose it all on his own – he seems so inept.

I would not disagree with that, and I don’t disagree with Warren’s take that TB is not much fun. But it is central and therefore powerful.

By contrast, most ministers in the past 40 years or so have been happy to get out of INAC before they are damaged….as long as they don’t get Veterans, another profoundly dysfunctional department.

Getting R-W out of Justice suggests to me that a horrific bodge-job on the energy file is coming soon, likely at the expense of the First Nations consultations process that looked so easy to them until they tried it.

Ronald O'Dowd says: 

January 15, 2019 at 4:07 pm

Ian,

In my book, First Nations should be enshrined in the constitution as the fourth order of government. I would support a limited veto power to the extent that any project would have to reflect their demands and interests as nations. How you grease the wheel in their favour without grinding things to an absolute halt is beyond my pay grade. But mere consultations is hardly the appropriate remedy. It is beyond disrespectful and makes a sham of the stakeholder process.

Reply


Ian says: 

January 15, 2019 at 7:14 pm

It is horribly unclear. The requirement to consult meaningfully ends up being a very vague requirement when you try to translate into the language of negotiation. Do FNs have a veto? Or do corporations/government simply have to keep them well informed and ‘listen to their concerns’? If you accommodate half of the concerns raised, was it meaningful?

That said, it is just shocking how bad so many resource companies are at doing it. The vagueness is a known problem that doesn’t go away by doing the bare minimum.

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s move from Justice to VA is a massive fuckup and nothing but a demotion.

Justin Trudeau continues the one tradition he has honestly perfected since becoming PM and that is completely fucking over his MP’s no matter their compotence and loyalty.

He is honestly so goddamn good at jilting his own caucus with stupid ass role decisions and he’s even worse at explaining them afterwards. No coherent logic and no political strategy whatsoever.

If anything is going to bring his leadership down, its the disaffected members in his caucus: a steadily growing group.

I don’t like any more than you the way the yellow jackets are going about things but one thing remains clear: Macron is failing the French people. These are deep societal ills and it’s his job to move heaven and earth to successfully address them. The French don’t want virtue signalling or lectures. They want results. And if Macron can’t provide them, he deserves to be out on his ass at the end of his term.

3. If she – as you seem to be asserting – was demoted because she was a pre-columbian female, then you are accusing Justin and the cabinet and the LPC caucus of being either misogynist or racist or both.

Agree that some of the ministers got shuffled to portfolios that were clearly a demotion – and an undeserved demotion at that.

Disagree that demoting women or Indigenous people, in isolation, is somehow racist or sexist. Qualified people should be promoted; less qualified people should not. Skin colour or gender should be irrelevant. That is true equality.

Terence,

Are you old enough to remember Pierre Elliott Trudeau’s strong cabinets? If not, you may want to visit the National Archives to scrutinize the several instances where the PM did not get his way with cabinet. Can the current PM also claim that same badge of honour? I disliked his father but the man respected the sacred principle of cabinet government.

For those of you in constitutional law, I was under the impression that in Equitas that the Trudeau government essentially defended with the same legal arguments as Harper? (SCOC declined to hear an appeal.)

Sure, they injected more money but in the end they were not prepared to pay up to the level demanded by veterans’ groups.

Yes Trudeau injected more money.
By my count, it was negative $1.8B more.

Carolyn Bennett is maybe one of the most disappointing Ministers in cabinet. Most of the Cabinet are unqualified, immature and incompetent. I actually expected some degree of skill from her.

Let’s spell it out. The Inner Party of Liberal Party of Canada is the Council of Economic Advisors, a 14-member group chaired by Dominic Barton of McKinsey & Company. The prime directive of CoEA is McKinsey’s “Century Initiative – 100 Million Canadians in 2100”. As such, Aboriginal and Heirloom Canadians are not even on the radar. As Karen Wang proved, not all is sweetness and light among Liberal’s hand-picked, foreign-born candidates. Enron was the creation of Jeff Skilling – McKinsey consultant for 21 years and subsequently jailed after Enron collapsed – suggesting Century Initiative could end in tears. Sadly, I think it will as Aboriginals and “nativists” turn to so-called populism.

Art,

I’m partly with you: the extreme right, populist, nationalist or otherwise are not only dangerous to our national security but also to world peace.

However you are beyond generous when you say that most countries envy a humming-along Canada. Cause we ain’t: this government’s spending is irresponsible. You can’t buy your way to re-election. Why has this Prime Minister still not brokered a pipeline deal? Isn’t that his job, his responsibility, as the federal honest broker? Why are so many small-c conservatives and blue liberals pissed about marijuana?

Maybe now you get why the holy trinity in the PMO need to be gone yesterday. Otherwise, just kiss off the next election and prepare for a Conservative minority because it’s coming if his friends in the PMO don’t disappear. Plain and simple.

The pipeline problems are pretty small compared to endless Frence pretests, Brexit or the US government shutdown.

“Why are so many small-c conservatives and blue liberals pissed about marijuana?”

Because of supply problems, I assume?

Mr. O’Dowd, with all due respect your comments seem to indicate you are in a panic about the Libs chances. I am see ing some new candidates who are very qualified/electable people and they have recruited star candidates to run against Tory stars like Lisa Raitt who now has an olympic hero from the area to run against her in Milton (905 area). They had about 1500 people show up today on a very cold Sunday to vote in the nomination process. So I don’t see your panic going anywhere.

Despite the haughty rhetoric on social issues, Trudeau has more or less followed Harper, who at least never over promised. This has needlessly stirred up division in a country still scarred from the regional and constitutional disputes of the 80’s and 90’s. On the economic front, Trudeau inherited a balanced budget and the best global economic growth in a decade and still managed to run a deficit about nothing and send capital fleeing. In foreign affairs, the “Canada’s Back” claim rings hollow against the Bollywood Affair, friction with Saudi and naively getting involved in the ongoing US-China escalation. So why is this government still polling so well?

Look at the alternatives.

The Cons have a leader even less charismatic than Harper, and much more of a captive creature of that party’s right wing.

The NDP have an imitation Trudeau who is foundering badly and has alienated traditional NDP constituencies.

The Bloc are in a state of collapse, with separatist support in Quebec completely fragmented into several provincial parties with very very different views on issues.

The Greens are a vanity party run by everyone’s favourite autocrat, which functions to put a ceiling on their ability to do anything but return May to Parliament. Any other centers of strength and organization routinely enter into conflict with the leader’s office, and go do something else. Deputy leaders have about a three year half life.

“And China is is country to exemplify? You need to study up a bit more on foreign relations.”

You need to study up a bit more on basic English.

The word ‘exemplify’ means ” be characteristic of” or “clarify by giving an example of” (of exactly what, Art? Your sentence above makes no sense, sorry). The word you were looking for was probably ’emulate’…and yes, Trudeau *does* have a “basic admiration” for China’s dictatorship (or so he said, right?).

670,Warren Kinsella,A Liberal Deputy Prime Minister on Trudeau’s treatment of indigenous leaders: “bad”,2019-01-21 08:59:00,Warren,,"From former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps, in today’s Hill Times:

On the cabinet shuffle, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demoted a female aboriginal star when he shuffled Jody Wilson-Raybould out of the Justice portfolio. Wilson-Raybould, an articulate former chief, was actively courted by the Liberals because of her reputation in legal and aboriginal circles. The Justice portfolio was especially tricky because of her Indigenous roots. As witnessed in the numerous western pipeline protests, the aboriginal community is split in its view of consultation and pipeline location…

Wilson-Raybould navigated those murky waters very capably, privately pushing the government to move more quickly while publicly remaining on board in cabinet solidarity.

The prime minister’s explanation for why she was moved did not ring true. The notion that the veterans’ file needed a steadier hand was contradictory because the outgoing minister, Seamus O’Regan, was tasked to work on aboriginal issues.

The prime minister has repeatedly stated the top government priority is reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. That should have been more important than dealing with the challenges facing veterans. Wilson-Raybould was right to be irked about the move. As a good soldier, she said all the right things about her new portfolio but her body language made it very clear. This was neither a welcome, nor a lateral move.

This is the second time a Liberal Indigenous minister has been downgraded.

The last was when Hunter Tootoo left cabinet and caucus to deal with a substance abuse problem coupled with an inappropriate staff relationship. That occurred almost two years ago. Since then, he has cleaned up his act, but repeated attempts to rejoin the Liberal caucus have been spurned.

Seamus O’Regan successfully underwent treatment for substance abuse and was rewarded with a cabinet position. Tootoo is still lingering in limbo. Both have much in common. They have struggled with the demons of alcohol. But O’Regan has been rewarded for coping while Tootoo has been shunned.

Prime ministerial insiders were spinning that Raybould-Wilson was hard to get along within cabinet. When her people have expectations that have been stoked by government, she had no choice but to fight harder for change.

Trudeau’s cabinet shuffle was based on bad advice. Whoever recommended the demotion of Raybould-Wilson should bow out. Trudeau made the decision but, ultimately, hubris on the prime minister’s team is costing him","<div class=""articlecontent"">

668,Warren Kinsella,Column: Trudeau turns his back on women and indigenous people,2019-01-22 08:18:00,Warren,,"Justin Trudeau said he’d support indigenous leaders.

He didn’t.

Justin Trudeau said he’s a feminist.

He isn’t.

Justin Trudeau is a terrific actor, however. There he was, after his latest cabinet shuffle, and butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth. He almost sounded offended.

Demoting a competent, smart, inspiring indigenous woman like Jody Wilson-Raybould – as the Liberal leader had literally done, just minutes before inside Rideau Hall – wasn’t a demotion at all, he huffed. There can be no greater honour than working with Canada’s veterans, he insisted.

And if some other Prime Minister had said it, it’d be partly true: it is an honour assisting the men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces. But under Trudeau, it was a lie. Under him, Veteran’s Affairs has become a political landfill. Under him, veterans have been disregarded, disrespected, and litigated against in the courts.

So, everyone recognized Trudeau’s claim for what it was, which was unadulterated bullshit.

This was the truth: Jody Wilson-Raybould was demoted – as she effectively later confirmed herself, in her own words, with an extraordinary statement to the constituents who first elected her in 2015. She’d been dumped. She’d been rendered PNG – persona non grata, to appropriate a phrase from The PMO Kid’s fave TV show, The Americans.

Why? Because she threatened them.

Leaving aside her gender, leaving aside her indigenous heritage, Wilson-Raybould was simply the most effective Minister of Justice in a long, long time. And she was insufficiently deferential to Justin Trudeau and the grievance-nurturing children who comprise his entourage. Or, as a Maclean’s writer memorably called them, “a tiny cadre of out-of-their-league staffers operating out of the Building Formerly Known as Langevin.”

Jody Wilson-Raybould spoke truth to power, as she herself said. She didn’t suffer fools gladly, as was well-known. She was impatient for change – for women, for the forgotten, for First Nations people.

But Justin Trudeau and his oxymoronic brain trust – who always regard dissent as treason, and who always see themselves alone as the stewards of all that is good and true and Canadian – didn’t like that. They didn’t like that at all.

As “feminists,” as those who claim to empower all women, their most revealing moment came last Summer, when it was confirmed that Justin Trudeau had groped a female reporter at a long-ago festival in B.C. Trudeau’s response?

Believe women when they come forward. Just, you know, don’t believe that woman. Support women who are victimized by men.

Just not that one.

Jody Wilson-Raybould has achieved plenty in her career, as a wildly-successful lawyer, as a Crown Attorney, as the leader of the B.C. Treaty Commission, as the Grand Chief of her home province. She knows Trudeau’s type, one suspects. All capable women do.

Justin Trudeau – who was the beneficiary of the most inept Conservative and New Democratic election campaigns in a generation – is entirely that type. He was born to immense wealth, was elected due to his surname, and never held a Parliamentary position more senior than the youth critic for the third party in the House of Commons.

But as an actor – as the willing receptacle for bland, beige talking points, wheedled out of a focus group somewhere – he is without equal. He is indisputably the Phoney-in-Chief, and he is exceptionally good at it.

Will female voters be offended by Trudeau’s ritual knifing of Jody Wilson-Raybould? It’s unlikely, for now. With Andrew Scheer’s social media still churning out frat boy bumpersticker stuff – and with Jagmeet Singh continuing his downward descent into irrelevance – female voters, historically reliably liberal, will keep their powder dry.

Will indigenous leaders turn against Trudeau for what he did to Jody Wilson-Raybould? That seems more likely. Across Canada, indigenous leaders are increasingly muttering to each other that, at least with Stephen Harper, he was always truthful about his disinterest in their issues. Justin Trudeau, they say, cheerily says one thing to them, and then does another.

And what of Jody Wilson-Raybould? She should resist the temptation to quit – because that’s what Trudeau and his acolytes want her to do. She should do her new job well, bide her time, and wait for her moment.

Her leadership moment. It is coming.

And, she should always remember this: smart, capable women are used to dealing with insecure boy-men who have more power than brains.

Jody Wilson-Raybould is just the latest.

Part of the problem with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is that the media has let him off the hook on the groping incident and his flippant response to it (then and now). This is the same man who unceremoniously dumped 2 Liberal MPs based on unsubstantiated claims of sexual harassment. This story has been allowed to simply go away. However, it is a window on his style of leadership as much as the incident itself.

Terence,

They boxed themselves in by saying from the get-go that it wasn’t a demotion or a lateral move. And now they want to claim that another version of events has yet to be known. Come again?

Don’t they realize that they will look stupid for not having spit it out in the first place, if it has merit?

So Jody has many fans and is inspiration to women, indigenous people and lawyers…however Rosemary Barton said on At Issue that Jody was not doing the best job possible. Is it more than lack of conformity? Or is an ‘objective’ CBC reporter susceptible to party insider manipulation, Warren?

I’ve been watching the man-child with an admittedly jaded eye for some time now. I wasn’t a big fan of his dad but he did have my grudging respect, for being smart and sharp as a tack. Justin is neither of these, in fact the polar opposite. There’s just something about him I find unsettling, a dark secret of sorts, lingering not too far below the surface.

My significant other, and for the record, most gen X women I know, find him “creepy”. Their words, not mine.

Which brings up an interesting article I read, by a lady named Amy MacPherson. Perhaps you know here Warren, perhaps someone else here does. In any case her article in her pinned tweet here: https://twitter.com/MsAmyMacPherson was a riveting read, and left me somewhat uncomfortable. She’s not a raging conservative by any means, but she’s definitely not juniors #1 fan either.

Some of the allegations in her article are quite disturbing, I did some rudimentary follow up on a few and could find nothing to discredit them, in fact a few were verified.

What bothers me, is if they are what they say they are – why have we not heard more about them? Is she a kook nobody listens to?

Honest question, I’ve never really heard of her before.

Oh come on. Surely there’s nothing creepy about a 47-year old man passing himself off as a teen heartthrob. Nope nothing creepy at all about that, totally normal behaviour.

What I was referring to was the silencing of serious allegations from very high level operatives, and how some things have been scrubbed from internet history. This is unsettling.

Junior’s creepy behaviour is almost a side bar to this story, but it is there nonetheless. The fact that he was roommates with a pedophile who plied his trade in their shared residence is more than disturbing, as is the media’s (mostly) hands off approach to this story. If a conservative high ranking official had this same history, would they get the same coverage?

Ask yourself that..

I was being sarcastic – that was evident with “47-year old teen heartthrob”.

I agree with you. I personally was not aware of the Ingvaldson story until you brought it to our attention here.

The Doctor says:

The stuff regarding Ingvaldson has been known and floating around in certain Vancouver circles for some time. West Point Grey Academy is not some obscure school; it’s a prominent pillar of Vancouver West Side respectability. I personally know people who work there. The overall impression is that the Ingvaldson stuff has been almost miraculously kept from the view/knowledge of the general public. As a rule, only very inside baseball people seem to know about it. And it does make you wonder: if that were another, less Teflon-coated politician, would such a connection in his or her life be almost completely unknown to the public?

Not that I disagree with what’s written in previous comments, but I think you have to take a drone’s eye view of the cabinet shuffle in light of the Wet’suwet’en chiefs’ assertion of their traditional land rights the previous week. It’s no secret that Ms. Wilson-Raybould strongly believes in indigenous peoples’ rights to traditional lands. Unfortunately as the Wet’suwet’en protest illustrated to the Liberal think tank, something has to give – either support indigenous peoples’ land rights or get something to tidewater. My bet is that they will be downplaying their indigenous promises re: indigenous self government and traditional land rights in the build up to the election. So I would suggest viewed in this light the Wilson-Raybould and Philpot shuffles get these high profile and effective Ministers out of their sensitive positions, put in O’Reagan who to date hasn’t done much of anything, and in this way pivot away from native peoples’ aspirations and previous government promises, and at the same time signal to those in the west that the Liberals are still trying to support Canada’s oil and natural gas sector.

On Reflection,

Their job isn’t to try and support Canada’s oil and natural gas sector. Their job is to broker the deal between Alberta and BC. As for the chiefs, they should be fairly compensated for any right-of-way that’s required. No one can get all First Nations on board but find a way to get more of them to the table. This has to be a four party deal otherwise the pipeline is dead.

Partially agree – there’s not a political entity in existence that does not have some level(s) of corruption within their ranks. It’s unfortunately just the nature of the game.

But I wouldn’t say the WH is any “worse” by any stretch. I personally know of a councilor who was just reelected in a band I am very close to (but don’t belong to) who has been feathering their nest very generously for over a decade. This particular band also has control over their own membership and can decide who and who can’t vote. They literally jumped for joy when Trudeau took away the Chief & councils obligation to post all expenditures etc online.

652,Warren Kinsella,Our federal leaders need to stay on social media – they constantly remind us why we need better ones,2019-02-05 13:04:00,Warren,,"Social media and politicians. Lets do a roundup,shall we?

The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, was apparently ‎watching TV before Christmas. A charity thing came on. It was raising money to help teach kids in the Third World. Noble cause.

Justin was in a good mood. He picked up his iPhone, and thumbed out a message to the host of the event, a comedian named Trevor Noah.

“Hey Trevor Noah – thanks for everything you’re doing…Sorry I can’t be with you – but how about Canada pledges $50 Million to support education for women and girls around the world?” Trudeau wrote. “Work for you? Let’s do it!”

Work for you? Not really. Didn’t “work” for many other Canadians, either.

In just a single tweet, Trudeau captured everything Canadian dislike about him, pretty much. You know: a preference for American celebrities over ordinary Canadians. A willingness to toss around other people’s money, in a manner that would shame the drunkest drunken sailor. A glib, cloying, puerile approach that is in no way Prime Ministerial.

Oh, and a false belief that he is the master of all social media. That too.

He isn’t.

In that regard, Justin Trudeau is like his principal antagonist, Andrew Scheer. Andrew thinks he’s good at this Internet stuff, too.

He isn’t.

Take, for instance, the Conservative leader’s apparent belief that Google is run by a gaggle of Bolsheviks in a boiler-room somewhere, maliciously manipulating search results to create the impression that terrorists are military heroes.

Seriously, he believes that. Last week, Andrew did a Google search for “Canadian soldiers.” That returned pictures of actual Canadian military heroes. So far so good.

But then the Google elflords offered up a photo of Omar Khadr. Omar, as you may recall, is the youthful al-Qaeda and Taliban enthusiast who killed a U.S. medic while the medic was tending to wounded people during a battle in Afghanistan.

Andrew was outraged by that. He tweeted his outrage to Google, along with a screencap that helpfully pointed to “Canadian soldiers” and “Omar Khadr.”

Scheer huffed that Omar Khadr “is not a victim, nor ‎should he be portrayed in this way alongside real Canadian heroes.” Conservative trolls and pundits, often interchangeable, were similarly outraged. How dare Google do such a thing!

Except:‎ Google didn’t. Google’s algorithim did.

It’s amazing, really, that it needs to be said to a guy who could actually become Prime Minister of Canada and all that, but here goes: that’s not how the Internet works, Andrew. There are no youngsters in a dark subterranean lair at Google’s headquarters‎, drinking fizzy pop and giddily coming up with search results designed to outrage the perpetually-outraged.

The Omar Khadr result comes from Wikidata, which came from a Wikipedia entry, which ‎came from a troll who lives in – wait for it! – Russia.

Yes, the man who would be Prime Minister was tricked by an Internet troll named “Ghuron” in St. Petersburg, Russia. (Oh, and those mysterious “algorithms,” Andrew? Despite the presence of his name in that word, they were not invented by Al Gore.)

Scheer’s tweet illustrated, pithily, why so many Canadians believe the dimpled Tory leader is unworthy of high office: he is terrified that his base will disapprove of him, and remove him.

So he comes up with juvenile, frat-boy memes that appeal to his meat-eating base, and no one else at all. He remains focused, laser-like, on the trivial stuff. He can work at Rebel Media or Breitbart when he loses the next election, one supposes.

His fellow Opposition leader Jagmeet Singh is going to lose, too.

Why? Because the mere suggestion that the New Democratic Party leader makes dumb mistakes is no longer news, sadly. It happens a lot. It is accepted truth.

Like Justin and Andrew, Jagmeet’s ‎mistake was captured in cyber-amber for all to see. A little while ago, Jagmeet tweeted that Canada should side with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Here’s what he said: “The question of who is to lead Venezuela should be in the hands of Venezuelans. All countries should be free to make their own democratic decisions through free and fair elections, independent of authoritative pressure.”

All well and good, except for this: Nicolas Maduro is venal, vicious, human-rights-violating thug. He is a monster who has intimidated, persecuted and prosecuted any Venezuelan who dares to criticize him. His election was a fraud.

Independent human rights bodies have accused him of torturing dissidents, and starving his own people. Amnesty International has reported that 75 per cent of Venezuelans suffer from weight loss and malnutrition due to lack of food.

Why would Jagmeet defend such a creep? Why would he say Canada should support a cruel dictator? God knows. But that single tweet, once again, makes clear that Jagmeet Singh lacks judgment, lacks insight, and lacks what it takes to be a Member of Parliament, let alone Prime Minister.

At the end of all this cyber-stupidity, Canadians might reasonably ask: are any of these men fit to be Prime Minister? And why, pray tell, do they all continue to use social media?

Good questions. Canadians themselves will determine who is fit, and who is not, soon enough.

But should they all stop using social media, given how completely – and how regularly – it proves how unworthy they are?

No. We should be grateful to social media.

Better that we know how unfit they all are, so we can choose better when next given the chance.

Let us assume correctly that few politicians in CANADA actually have the experience of our host when it comes to Social Media or the MSM. Moreover, these politicians are not experts in terms of cybernetics or Social Psychology. They are not Sociologists or full time Journalists. Their scope is academically dissimilar to that of journalistic punditry and as such should not be evaluated by the same yardstick.

Politicians are human with all the errors that amass from living a life as a political party leader or follower of party formatting & protocols. In Scheer’s case he is pandering to his base and that of the populists that are singularly purposed with a one-track mindset. Scheer’s sloganeering does not have to actually make sense to find appeal to his base. In Trump’s case South of the border he told populists that he could shoot someone on the streets of New York and still get elected. Populists say stupid things so that the dumb & ignorant base understand they can say similar inanities to rile opposition.

Trudeau has been our youngest PM too. Is he not entitled to be young and somewhat naïve at times? Should Scheer have the same level of political gravitas as a veteran lawyer/Journalist that worked Parliament in the 90s and then moved on?

Is this comment intended as satire? Justin Trudeau is almost 50 years old. He’s slightly older than me, and I haven’t been “young and naive” in decades.

Regardless of age, both men are leaders of Canada’s two main political parties so, yes, they should have gravitas and, no, they aren’t entitled to be “young and naive” .

I’m younger than he is. I can easily see what’s wrong with many of his decisions. I can see upsides, too, to many of them, but to me, the downsides are frequently outweighing the upsides.

The particular incident Warren calls attention to sounds like a gross breach of fiduciary duty, a lack of due diligence, and in general seems to be a Prime Minister who wants to act as a leader without any of the responsibility. You want to spend $50m on that? Fine, but you’d better be ready to prove *why* that’s where you should spend that $50m. None of that is on display here.

“All well and good, except for this: Nicolas Maduro is venal, vicious, human-rights-violating thug. He is a monster who has intimidated, persecuted and prosecuted any Venezuelan who dares to criticize him. His election was a fraud.”

Horse manure all around. You haven’t followed the Bolivarian revolution like I have, or you wouldn’t say such things. The US sanctions ruined the place in four years, so that the spending of oil royalties on the poor ground to a halt. Then the US/Saudi oil price decrease of 2015 which damn near ruined Alberta completely knocked Venezuela down. It’s the US wanting to seize 300 billion barrels of oil, a hostile takeover disguised as human rights relief. A complete sham. Guaido, chosen president “elect” wasn’t even elected in the first place. He was trained in Washington, however.

Like our made-in-USA foreign policy, the West in general has rubber -stamped yet another imposition of a right wing dork on a foreign country’s people. Remember Chile? And I’m not even NDP, but by God sir, I can read and I have for years about this ridiculous rubbing out of a country that had socialist principles.

It’s why I regard all our politicians as uselessly mendacious given half a chance. They all stand up on their hind legs and yap nonsense most of the time. And this to me is one of the most egregious times. I am thoroughly ashamed of my country on this matter.

If anything, their Twitter avatars are reflections of how their staff want you to view their respective leaders.

.. a fine article.. really !
I suspect many commenters can supplement or buttress your perspective.. but one can also point to complete hysterical fails in all three cases.. and reason to lower expectations. the Trudeau example BTW was new to me.

Singh I keep pointing out has never exemplified ‘leadership’, so why expect it now? He did great at selling retail Party memberships.. so he won a strange ‘popularity’ contest (much like Patrick Brown)

Scheer should be ashamed of his hysterics. His vapid pontifications are insulting, and to pretend he’s ‘middle class’ is to laugh. What middle class Canadian has net worth approx 10 million & has been housed and fed by Canadian tax payers for approx 10 years now? He is rolling in luxury on our dime ! His ignorance re the Khadr facts astonish. Has he never read Sandy’s Garossino ? Or testimonies of senior American officers on site for the arial bombardment with attack helicopters, gunships, laser guided 500 lb smart bombs, the firefight with morters and final Special Forces assault ? Or that The Sgt Laine Morris who was blinded in one eye by stone chps or shrapnel had been airlifted out 2 hours before.. that Khadr was covered in rubble, unconcious and shot twice in the back at extreme close range. Never mind rhe conspiracy by Harper and McKay to use him as a whipping boy

Deary me.. these ‘leaders’ go into verbal contortions, banal talking point pronouncements and fiction.. All three parties are so full of themselves and/or faux evangelism & they think they can get away with being posturing, preening fake ‘public servants’

Social media, especially Twitter, is for twits. I refuse to join it. I guess I talk to friends on Facebook but ignore politicians on social media.
I try to pay attention to real issues, such as Scheer’s pathetic sucking-up to separatists by offering Quebec a chance to hold almost 30% of the government’s revenue hostage if it so feels. Now THAT is the kind of thing that makes him unfit to be PM. Trudeau’s a big disappointment but he doesn’t fall for that continual Con trap of thinking footsie with the separatists is a legit path to power.

In case you’re interested, the present Quebec Premier is one breath away from being a sovereignist. It gets to be Trudeau’s choice whether he will cozy up to him. Poor Justin, he doesn’t have the premier hostage. That only worked with the last guy.

The Liberal poll #s are practically at double the Conservative or Bloc numbers in Quebec and the NDP is at or below 8%. Trudeau doesn’t need to suck up to Legault and has stated that he’d never propose Scheer’s plan and that Scheer’s plan is a terrible idea.

Derek,

Federal poll numbers are irrelevant.What counts is Legault’s polling and what he does with it after this Prime Minister tells him to take a hike re: Quebec’s traditional constitutional demands.

Unlike his predecessors, Legault has the private-sector cred to win a sovereignty referendum. Meanwhile, English Canada and Ottawa remain in their habitual comatose state.

Miles Lunn says: 

February 7, 2019 at 12:26 am

Quebec is quite fickle and can change on a moment’s notice. Legault has the highest approval rating of any premier. Yes he is now in his honeymoon phase and there is a good chance that will have worn off by October, but if it hasn’t, things could get interesting. Lets remember if you look at past polling, 20 or 30 point swings between when writ is dropped and e-day are not uncommon in Quebec and unlike in the rest of Canada where you don’t see this. NDP in 2011 entered the election with poll numbers in the mid teens in Quebec, but got 43% on election day. In 2015, NDP had a 30 point lead at beginning of campaign in Quebec but lost that mostly to the Liberals.

Now on Quebec, I like the idea of a single tax form, filling out two would be a real pain, nonetheless probably better if they just have it done federally like the other nine provinces do. On taxes I have long thought a simplified tax system with 3 brackets and no deductions is the way to go in the long run. Mine would be 10% for bottom, 20% for middle and 30% for top, while if provinces could align with 5% bottom, 10% middle, and 15% top that would make our taxes both lower for middle and lower income while competitive for top and a lot simpler thus easier to catch the tax cheats.

Ronald O'Dowd says: 

February 7, 2019 at 9:51 am

Miles,

In Quebec, symbolism is almost everything. Only here would filling out one tax form be seen as a federal concession (victory) as regards the division of powers. But of course, that concession would have to be revenue-neutral otherwise the feds would never go for it. In other words, Quebec would have to pass on Ottawa’s share of tax revenue in an expeditious manner. No farting around or chantage allowed.

Mediocrity after mediocrity.

Two problems I see with the choices are:
1. What happened to the centre? 20 years ago you had the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives who were both near the centre but if someone showed me Trudeau’s platform without mentioning the party I would think it was an NDP platform while for the Tories, theirs is far more like the Reform Party than the former PCs. Much of our success is because usually our PMs regardless of party are near the middle, but today that seems to vanishing.

2. Negativity and lack of strong leaders – Considering the amount of hate and negativity, the best leaders don’t bother going into politics anymore and instead have a career in the private sector which both pays more (if successful) and you aren’t reviled by more than half the country. Both John Manley and Frank McKenna in recent interviews even admitted that if things were like today’s environment when they went into politics, they wouldn’t have gone in. Thus that explains why we have the weak leaders we do.

Had Liberals wisely chosen Marc Garneau (Martha Hall Findlay would work too) and Tories wisely chosen Michael Chong (Erin O’Toole and Lisa Raitt would do too) we would have had two strong moderate centrist choices. Those were my first choices for both leadership races, but it seems Liberals preferred celebrity and name recognition to qualifications while Tories preferred someone who could appeal most to their base rather than broaden their appeal.

648,Warren Kinsella,Shocker: Why Jody Wilson-Raybould was knifed by Justin Trudeau,2019-02-07 07:07:00,Warren,,"Is Justin Trudeau’s PMO corrupt?

And did they punish the first female indigenous leader for refusing to go along with a dirty deal for their cronies?

This Globe and Mail story strongly suggests the answer is yes, to both questions. If true, this is corruption at the very highest levels of the federal government.

I’ve known this story was coming, but didn’t know it would be this bad. It’s bad.

It’s now clear that Justin Trudeau knifed Jody Wilson-Raybould because she refused to protect friends of Justin Trudeau. Friends enmeshed in multiple corruption scandals.

This one has it all: racism, cronyism, corruption. More shocking highlights below. Link here.



Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office attempted to press Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister to intervene in the corruption and fraud prosecution of Montreal engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., sources say, but she refused to ask federal prosecutors to make a deal with the company that could prevent a costly trial.


SNC-Lavalin has sought to avoid a criminal trial on fraud and corruption charges stemming from an RCMP investigation into its business dealings in Libya…


Sources say Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who was justice minister and attorney-general until she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs early this year, came under heavy pressure to persuade the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to change its mind.


Sources say officials from Mr. Trudeau’s office, whom they did not identify, had urged Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister, to press the public prosecution office to abandon the court proceedings.


Ms. Wilson-Raybould trusted the judgment of the public prosecutor and did not believe it was proper for the attorney-general to intervene, especially if there could be any suggestion of political interference, sources say…


Since the beginning of 2017, representatives of SNC-Lavalin met with federal government officials and parliamentarians more than 50 times on the topic of “justice” and “law enforcement,” according to the federal lobbyists registry. This includes 14 visits with people in the PMO. Those they met included Gerald Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, and Mathieu Bouchard, Mr. Trudeau’s senior adviser on Quebec – whom they met 12 times. Mr. Trudeau’s senior policy adviser, Elder Marques, also met with company representatives.


This revelation, if true, is a clear violation of section 139(2) of the Criminal Code. Will the Conservatives, who have been lobbied just as aggressively by SNC Lavalin, do the right thing, and shut down Parliament until there is a Mueller-type independent inquiry? Will they, at the very least, swear a complaint with the RCMP? I’m not holding my breath.

When you get banned that indicates those news media are corrupt too. So make a list of all the corrupt news media outlets. Canadians get a far better coverage from whistle blowers and blogs and comments then from news papers and news station on TV. All for free.

The Globe and Mail will need to stick with the story. Every day and every step taken.

Body language of Jody Wilson Raybould speaks volumes and her father pretty much has spilled the beans.

The current AG that replaced JWR is from Trudeaus riding so doesnt that looked planned. So many crooked people come from Quebec and are rich. Find that interesting. These same people give money.

Comments of people are the best way to discover the truth. Every angle is important and it was the Trudeau government that brought in the deferred prosecution agreements or remediation agreement as they call it. So its all been planned since obviously JWR refused to be forced to pressure even though there were fourteen meetings. Cant say there was no pressure. The fourteen meetings prove it. Any whistle blowers from SNC Lavelin with any knowledge that SNC Lavelin do what they do best….bribed the PMO office behind the scenes and figured they can get away with it. They have been caught bribing and made lots of money off of their bribes, Any money offered to the PMO or the present AG. Good question to wonder.

Is it not counterproductive to swear a complaint and bring in the RCMP at this point? Doesn’t that have the effect of all PMO responses being “no comment while this is under investigation” “wouldn’t want to interfere with the work of the RCMP”, etc.?

Probably best to take some time to hammer away in the House, and on the streets. Call for an inquiry and then eventually swear the complaint if no one else has.

I think this one has “legs”.

February 7, 2019 at 12:46 pm

While it would appear that this story is damaging, I am still a bit sceptical of the allegations.

SNC-Lavalin naturally has a lot of clout, but I suspect that they wouldn’t need the support of the AG to halt prosecution . Plenty of people in Public Prosecution who would have no appetite for the case based on difficulty and technicalities involved with prosecution canadian companies for a single count of corruption under Section 3(1)(b) of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

The fraud under section 380 of the Criminal Code of Canada is an easier charge to prosecute, but it’s not something a company the seize of SNC feels is terribly endangering. They probably set aside contingency funds for this sort of risk, and would feel they can take their change in court.

(Having seen thse prosecutions from the inside – RCMP IMET – I’ve seen how these things play out. Simply white collar crime doesn’t really amount to much in Canada, and SNC would probably not be that interested in drawing more attention to the case then or really want to play this card). Of course I haven’t seen the evidence or know how strong the case is.

But, it would appear to also a case of sour grapes with JWR. The move seemed a long time coming after she lost the respect of many in the legal community – certainly the criminal legal community. (but that’s a whole other story). So shuffle seemed imminent anyways.

Anyways, it’s certainly good fodder for the conservatives, but not sure if this is an accurate picture.

Vice-Admiral Norman is probably more of a concernning case. I’m betting they will lose that one with Marie Henein as counsel for defense

Good points as always. Also the new Remediation or Deferred Prosecution options are new to Canada and maybe the Givernment was not to far off side in asking them to explore that option. It normally comes with significant monitoring of on going business transactions for years to come and keeps a company employing Canadians. I don’t get offended if that was the “pressing” issue.

It’s not for the AG to decide. That was apparently JWR’s stance, and it’s the right one. If a Crown under her decided not to proceed, because reasons, then no problem. But she should never have been asked to intervene in the first place. That is where the law was broken.

Interesting take on BNN. SNC isn’t all that good for business either. If people think that corrupt companies that make money should be left alone so we are all better off then they have a very strange view of how business works. SNC is taking business from ethical companies in Canada and therefor encouraging the creation of a business environment that requires companies to discard their ethics in order to compete.

This is not good. She was one of the more competent cabinet ministers and this could come back to bite them. Off course scandals take time to settle in the public minds after all sponsorship scandal didn’t hurt Martin in 2004, but did in 2006 so the question is are we too close to the election for this to take hold or not? This looks bad and will be interesting to see how this unfolds. SNC-Lavalin does have a bad record as didn’t they do a corrupt deal with Muammar Gaddafi when he was still Libyan dictator so not totally surprised, but you would expect our government being democratic to say no to this sleaze.

Anyways as a BC Liberal supporter and just watching their campaign to make their team for next election more diverse and more representative of modern BC, I would love to see her run provincially where if the BC Liberals win next time she could be justice minister. Not sure what her provincial leanings are though as BC Liberals are more conservative than federal Liberals, but since the Trudeau guys seem to not want her, maybe she should go provincial.

Admittedly, I’ve never heard it from a First Nations woman so perhaps I’m only in racist-mysoginist circles.
New Justice minister has a great reputation, perhaps this made a stronger cabinet.
As for SNC-L, they are crooks who lobby anybody who takes meetings. I love how our tight financing laws allows their $125K donations (that’s one midlevel salary at HQ) to even make this a feasible story. Ahh, Canada.
The article seems to gain steam with JWR denying comment, and the whole thing may have come to the Globe from her people but maybe that’s just payback for an oldschool plain knifing? If so, this added hubbub definitely helps her cause.

Why, because (1) they think that SNC will pay the fine and it will be business as usual (2) It’s just another Quebec based scandal (3) The Liberal are indebted to SNC and would pay dearly in the next election in Quebec if SNC jobs were sacrificed. Odd how a 100K jobs in Alberta don’t matter (no Liberal votes there) but 8K jobs in Quebec are the end all, be all. Time to buy SNC shares.

Butts character assassination of Wilson-Raybould has begun in an effort to save his own ass.

I doubt the law was ever intended to prevent a lawyer from coming forward if she’s the victim of a crime. I’m not convinced that’s the case here, but it definitely seems like I’m supposed to believe it is.

Alternatively: “Where the government is clearly acting unlawfully, i.e., refusing advice of clear unconstitutionality or attempting to interfere with the attorney general’s prosecutorial discretion, such a disclosure could arguably be an ethical obligation instead of an ethical violation. That is, the two situations that arguably require an attorney general’s resignation are the situations in which disclosing the reasons for resignation is most defensible. Nonetheless, presumably the attorney general would, as with other exceptions to confidentiality, be required to disclose only as much information as necessary. A corresponding exception could be recognized to solicitor-client privilege. Arguably, a third situation also makes disclosure defensible: where the attorney general feels it necessary, as a lawyer, to disassociate himself from the actions of the prime minister or Cabinet that threaten public confidence in the administration of justice.”

I see our AG Lametti has decided Justin is pure as the driven snow because the PM has assured him he has done no wrong….. “But certainly from what I have seen, and what the prime minister has said, I can reassure Canadians that there has been nothing inappropriate that has happened,” Lametti said…..so I guess this AG was well chosen….he is able to determine guilt and innocence BEFORE any type of investigation is carried out. And just imagine how much money we can save by simply asking any potential criminal if they did it or not.

AG Lametti is right to assert that there is NO incriminating evidence to suggest that a public inquiry is warranted. Our Prime Minister has stated publically that the allegations are ‘false’. Presumption of innocence is still protocol, eh?

With opposition hurling spaghetti on the wall and looking to see what sticks we are still waiting for the smoking gun evidence to fire up any sort of criminal investigation by the RCMP Major Crimes Unit.

The PM will prorogue Parliament if opposition gets remotely close to a public inquiry.

It means the Nixonian coverup has started.

The Star has the story today, and they’re leading with it. It’s important. And it calls to mind what Howard Baker said about Watergate-style cover-ups, and he’d know: “It is almost always the cover-up rather than the event that causes trouble.”

Here’s the Star story:

OTTAWA—The Liberal government appears likely to block opposition efforts to probe allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, while insisting that discussions on the matter with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould were above board.

Justin Trudeau’s government will not yet waive solicitor-client privilege, which would give Wilson-Raybould latitude to speak about the allegation, nor will it permit a parliamentary committee to proceed with its own investigation, the Star has learned.

Wilson-Raybould has remained silent since the Globe and Mail reported Thursday that senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office pressed her to seek mediation instead of pursuing criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

The former justice minister — who was moved from her post in January — has refused to confirm or deny the allegations, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

A senior government official, speaking to the Star on the condition they not be named, said Saturday that the government will not waive the privilege — as demanded by opposition MPs — because SNC-Lavalin’s potential criminal trial remains before the courts. A second government source confirmed that the potential criminal trial, as well as SNC-Lavalin’s appeal of prosecutors’ denial of a mediation deal, makes waiving privilege unlikely.

Nor will the government agree to demands by the Conservatives and New Democrats for an emergency meeting of the Commons justice committee to summon Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau’s top political aides to testify publicly on the affair, the senior source said","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Given the alleged crime happened in Ontario, can the Ontario AG launch an investigation?

Can an Ontario government committee investigate and compel witnesses like Butts, Wilson-Raybould, Telford ect to appear?

Could the Trudeau government block any of those people from testifying?

Failing getting it into an Ontario government investigation, maybe someone should just leak the information. I mean Wilson-Raybould is a lawyer. You guys are trained to take notes right? She must have Comey style notes on the meetings detailing who said what.

I’m not a lawyer, but my guess (which, unlike some others here, is always based on logic and facts rather than what I really, really *want* to be true) would be no. Trudeau having a majority government means he can block any official inquiries, meaning that the only way to obtain any actual hard evidence of wrongdoing is unavailable. Without that evidence, no law enforcement agency can act….allegations are just not enough without some form of corroboration.

I want to get to the truth of this as much as anyone, but I just don’t see it happening without JWR breaking her silence.

There is nothing illegal about SNC trying to gather support from politicians to seek a more favorable legal outcome for them.

It was all done out in the open with records of the meeting in the lobbyist registry.

That SNC met with politicians isn’t the issue here.

The issue is the PMO (allegedly) tried to apply pressure to the Attorney General to do something to favor SNC.

PMO putting pressure on the AG to interfere in the legal process is called obstruction of justice.

Breaking News: members of the PMO may have mentioned the new remediation agreement in conversations w/ DoJ employees. Does mentioning this new mechanism more than 5 times in a 20 minute conversation constitute pressure? What about 1 time in 20 minutes? at what frequency does a mention become pressure? Asking for a friend.

Going forward, the law that prohibits dirty deals in other jurisdictions ought to be revisited. Why? It’s common practice in developing countries to require a bribe in order to win the contract. Other firms from similarly advanced countries like our own compete for these contracts AND do not criminalize this behaviour and presumably they generate jobs (trickle down is real, people). We need to accommodate cultural practices outside our borders; when in Rome, after all we are the best at celebrating diversity, we should be the most open minded to celebrating greasing palms.

Just saw this on Liberal Newsw – sorry, NATIONAL Newswatch (at least that’s what they call it, but anyone who has been there a few times will quickly figure out what kind of stories are prominently featured, and which ones are totally ignored..).

https://canadianlawyermag.com/author/michael-spratt/snc-lavalin-controversy-could-contain-key-to-wilson-rayboulds-shortcomings-16856/

I had no idea. This is going from bad to worse for the Trudeau Liberals.

Why is it that when conservatives are caught in a scandal, they must never be re-elected but when liberals are caught in repeated scandals we hear things like, “well at least it’s better than the conservatives”. Just let truth prevail. Whether the liberals or the conservatives are in power, we should all be asking for discovery so that the Canadian people can choose based on truth. Partisan issues should not be mixed with legal issues. It completely erodes any confidence in a government that is supposed to serve us, the people, not the other way around. If liberal supporters want to shovel this all under a carpet just to get liberals reelected, then they are just as guilty as the perpetrators. Same goes for conservatives. Just get to the bottom of it so the voters can pick their poison. And if someone goes to jail because their offence is punishable by law, then just let it happen. To say that a conservative should never get into power again because of the perceived faults of a previous conservative is to suggest that we don’t need a democratic process at all. Let’s all just sign up for the liberal dictatorship right here and now? I don’t think so bucko.

If nothing else, this situation has only raised JWR’s standing in my mind, and she was already a highlight on the federal scene, to me. I particularly like Philpott and Freeland too. I will be interested to see what sides people end up taking, should it come to that. It will be something else if the Libs manage to lose the next election — the alternatives might as well be potatoes.

I’m anything but a fan of MP Celina, who IMO has been somewhat of a race baiter.

But credit where credit is due, good on her! Nice to seem someone with the spine to not just fall in line like the rest of the robots.

She just earned a lot of respect from me. The anonymous smearing of JWR being orchestrated by Gerry Butts is unfathomably slimy, sickens me actually.

Celina also came out swinging along with another liberal, Lisa Kinsella. Trudeau has hurt the LPC, and I’m confident that many liberals do not identify with him. On a personal basis, I’m a liberal in exile and will return to the fold as soon as Trudeau and Butts are gone. I admire those liberals who are standing firm for what liberals believe in.

Taking a stand here, he gets himself notoriety and adulation. It’s a calculated move, like everything he’s done since he first positioned himself to run for a seat in the House.

ETHICS COMMISSIONER AGREES TO NDP REQUEST, LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO JUSTIN TRUDEAU & SNC-LAVALIN

OTTAWA – On Monday, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Mario Dion, agreed to a request from New Democrats to begin an investigation into the attempts by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office to provide SNC-Lavalin with a reduced punishment stemming from serious corruption charges. This is the latest in a long string of scandals that make it clear whose side Justin Trudeau is on: corporations and the super-rich.

“Canada’s Ethics Commissioner agrees there are sufficient grounds to begin an independent investigation into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office for the alleged special treatment they gave SNC-Lavalin,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. “The Liberals keep telling us how important an independent justice system is, but it all goes out the window when their friends are in trouble. The Liberals give big companies all the breaks while Canadians have to play by the rules and are still getting squeezed.”

“Justin Trudeau promised Canadians he would change the way politics worked in Ottawa, but instead his Liberal government continues to prioritize helping insiders and the rich get ahead. Canadians deserve better,” said NDP Ethics Critic Charlie Angus. “It’s no wonder that most Canadians feel like it’s big companies who are getting all the breaks, and not them. Canadians deserve to know whose side this government is on: everyday Canadians who follow the rules or a massive multinational corporation with deep ties to the Liberal Party?”

The pressure to go easy on SNC-Lavalin may have resulted in the termination of Jody Wilson Raybould as Attorney General and Minister of Justice, the first Indigenous woman to ever hold the post. In recent days, Liberal operatives have attempted to smear Wilson-Raybould’s performance even though she was widely seen as a credible and competent Minister throughout her tenure.

“We urge Mr. Trudeau’s team to stop trying to discredit Ms. Wilson-Raybould and to commit to fully cooperate with the Ethic Commissioner’s investigation. The Liberal government should also support the work of the Justice Committee who will be looking into other questions such as, why was the law that would help SNC-Lavalin changed in the first place and who pressured the former Attorney General to let SNC-Lavalin off the hook,” said NDP BC Liaison Nathan Cullen, “Canadians deserve answer.

That’s good, but we need an investigation from an entity that has actually penalties for a guilty finding other than a $500 fine.

Sure the optics of yet another guilty verdict to ethics laws violations would hurt, but still.

.. perhaps the ‘Liberal operators attempting to smear Wilson-Reybould’s performance’ could be named ?

How many are there? Are they men or women or just vague apparitions, short pants or skirted apparatchiks or actually real Public Servants, on salary & paid by Canadian taxpayers ?

This smacks of more smelly & vague innuendo piled higher and deeper.. much like the vaunted Globe and Mail ‘report’.. or subsequent flawed ‘journalism’ from such as Evan Soloman and Andrew Coyne. Mr Coyne manages to build his hysterical house of cards atop the Globe and Mail’s confused term salad. Was it urged, attempted to urge, put some pressure or heavy pressure towards two worthy women who stuck to the law.. abided by the law of the land accordingly !

Ho hum.. Andrew Scheer is busy busy making demands and posturing for the cameras at the drop of a hat.. Singh missed the boat, busy trying to get elected.. Presumably Scheer’s ‘demands’ are met with a stony ‘flock off’ From Minister & Prosecuter, seemingly the only persons with any real law experience and the Prime Minister himself.. can hold,forth via a spokeswank.. ideally one familiar with Criminal Law.. or at least can read.

the salamander,

Remember what Chrétien said to follow as a rule:
“I don’t know. A proof is a proof. What kind of a proof? It’s a proof. A proof is a proof, and when you have a good proof, it’s because it’s proven.”

This quote is unrelated to this situation but gets to the heart of it. No one can be named at this stage unless you like being sued for libel.

.. well said.. though in regard to libel or defamation.. the vague innuendo is already in print & the pile on continues & roughly follows partisan borders.

Who’s to say the ‘suspected staffers’ and all concerned, won’t just close ranks, circle the wagons.. wait for something new or stunning in the International News ? And let it blow over ?

My presumption is that discussions in Cabinet were many, lengthy, probably polarized ie the vaunted ‘situational ethics’ applied.. If Ms Wilson-Rebould held firm, amen. She did the right thing, as did Ms Roussel.. they can testify accordingly.. and that might be the saving grace of this entire ‘thing’ .. allowing any PMO meddlers to seal their lips

“save thousands of good paying jobs”

Tell that to the fine people of Alberta. Those SNC-Lavalin jobs still need to get done, it will be other companies doing it and ex-employees can work for them. It is not like the PM killed an entire industry or something like that…

Who gives a sh1t about SNC-Lavalin fat cats anyways, which is all about. Trudeau and the PMO certaintly don’t care about you.

Just thought it was curious that our gracious host, who is usually so diligent in sourcing any text quoted on this website, neglected to do so in this instance. And now I think I see why that decision was made.

I would much prefer to see this investigation in the hands of the RCMP than the [Liberal appointed] Ethics Commissioner. Trudeau and his cronies will now refuse comment, citing their respect for the Commissioner’s inquiry and the need to allow the Commissioner to carry out his task independently, etc. , or some similar bullshit. Trudeau will also do his best to stonewall the inquiry past the October election.

All the info coming out, the thing that stands out the most is that the original source went to the G&M instead of the police.
That would be the proper action, instead of going to the press with what are career ending allegations.
So this being the case, this appears to be more of a liberal civil war where on one side you have the establishment Laurentian Elite insiders that change allegiance to who ever wins the election and on the other side the liberal orthodoxy that is tired of being the useful idiots every election.
The means test is to ask, what would a smart prime minister do?

If he does win, the fact that the Tories picked another chubby nerdy white guy — and one with less charisma and intelligence than the last one — just might have something to do with the result.

Having said that, it’s not just Laurentian Canada where that brand has strength. Lots of urban proggie Liberals all over this land heart JT and the Liberal Vision that he pushes with every virtue signal that he emits. They’re all over my facebook feed.

.. the implication is..
Its possible to identify the alleged or suspected PMO staffers, as they are ‘suspected’ in regard to two current issues. Since their salary, expenses and possibly pensions are paid by Canadian taxpayers.. one presumes we can know exactly ‘who is employed in the PMO’.. and more specifically, said ‘suspected’ staffers with bad habits. It should not require an Ethics Investigation to find out how they occupy their days.. or what tasks are assigned them & by whom..

I don’t recall taxpayers having to pay anonymous or mysterious MP’s or Senators.. so why would we pay anonymous ‘staffers’ .. and.. do we even know their pay scale? Or qualifications ? Who would be able to provide such basic information ? And how long might that take ?

.. well Gord, essentially PMO ‘staffers’ or others with influence or power or access to directing use of taxpayer monies are Politicians. A sort of co-mingling so to speak. We may find out the exact roster & pecking order reality of PMO ‘staffers’ but even that may be hard to access

We saw this in the Harper era.. when Ray Novak (never elected) was lauded as the 2nd most powerful ‘politician’ in Canada. We payed his salary We also saw it via the illegal flittings of Stephen Lecce and Jenni Byrne back and forth from PMO to the Richmond Hill federal riding of Fantino and back to the safe haven of the PMO where we payed them as well. Sidenote – so much donor $ came in, that much of it was allegedly stashed into a secret 2nd campaign bank account. Funds were then distributed to numerous other riding campaigns. Lecce shared an office with a mysterious red goateed robocall genius from Alberta (ring a bell? He sued eventually & won regsrding his use of the Conservative electoral database). American GOP operatives knocked on doors. The office as the crow flies but 40 miles from Guelph. Lecce now ? A Doug Ford MPP, Byrne just left Ford for a new plum appointment, Ontario Hydro ?. Ethics Investigation ? What Investigation ?

629,Warren Kinsella,LavScam questions. I have plenty,2019-02-12 09:37:00,Warren,,"I have questions.

We know, from the Globe and Mail, that it was the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada, one Gerald Butts, who met with the Attorney-General of Canada in December to have a “robust discussion,” quote unquote, about perhaps giving the oleaginous SNC-Lavalin a sweetheart deal, and a free pass on those pesky corruption and bribery charges it was facing. You know: the SNC-Lavalin who had just earlier given the Liberal Party of Canada lots of illegal donations.

So: the Prime Minister’s Principal Secretary met with the Attorney General, and possibly other PMO fart-catchers, too. They say they all had lots of good-natured “robust discussions.” The Globe and Mail says some of them may have “obstructed justice.”

Anyway. That brings us to yesterday, when the Prime Minister of All Of Canada had a press avail thing in Vancouver. He was announcing something, but none of us can even remember what it was. We wanted to hear from him on the metastasizing scandal that some say is increasingly likely to lead to his defeat in October.

And here’s what he said. Read it carefully.


“I have met with Minister Wilson-Raybould a couple of times already since arriving in B.C. yesterday. We spoke about our shared goals for our country and for this government. She confirmed for me a conversation we had this Fall where I told her directly that any decisions on matters involving the director of public prosecutions were hers alone.”

See that? “A conversation we had this Fall where I told her directly that any decisions on matters involving the director of public prosecutions were hers alone.”

How interesting. I started shouting questions at the screen, when I heard that, but none of the reporters out in B.C. could hear me. So I will try again with you, gentle reader.
Why are we only learning now – four days into this greasy scandal – that the Prime Minister of Canada actually had “a conversation” with the Attorney General of Canada about a slimy multinational facing umpteen criminal charges? Why didn’t he admit that before now?
Who initiated this “robust discussion”? Did she? Did he? If it was the latter, why? Was it because he and his staff had been lobbied dozens and dozens of times by SNC-Lavalin in the preceding weeks?
What else was said? Did anyone take notes? We know from the Vice-Admiral Norman trial – where, yesterday, we learned that PMO had attempted to interfere with the prosecution, too – that note-taking is frowned upon in the rarefied air of the Prime Minister’s Office. I’ll bet, however, the Minister of Justice and her staff took notes. Where are said notes? Anyone done an ATIP yet? Why not, if not?
Oh, and on the Norman trial: did anyone else notice that the same PMO folks accused of trying to strong-arm supposedly-independent prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case are the selfsame folks who did strong-arm independent prosecutors in the Norman case? Did you notice that the judge noticed that, too?
And so on and so on. The big question, to this writer, is this: why would it even be necessary – in this over any other moral universe – for a Prime Minister to sit down with his Attorney General and say, as Justin Trudeau claims he did in October 2018 to Jody Wilson-Raybould, the following: “Hey, Jody, I just want to, er, robustly mention that decisions involving criminal prosecutions are yours and yours alone, um, but it sure would be a shame if a government-subsidized SNC-Lavalin building were to suddenly fall on your husband’s head on his way to work one morning.” Well, okay, we don’t know if he said that last part.


But we do know that Trudeau raised SNC-Lavalin’s criminal predicament with Jody in October 2018. He admitted that yesterday. He said that, for the first time.

Why did he? Why would he even need to say that he didn’t want to interfere with her prosecutorial role? Why would any Prime Minister ever need to say to a Minister: “Hey, don’t break the law.” Why do that? And why would his most senior advisor then show up a few weeks later, in December, to “robustly” talk about the very same thing, if everyone had already agreed in October to not, you know, break the law?

This part isn’t a question. It’s a statement. The Nixonian children’s crusade in PMO don’t want to relieve Jody Wilson-Raybouild of her lawyer’s obligation to maintain solicitor-client privilege for one reason: they don’t want the truth to come out. They are covering up.

But the truth, like water, always seeps out, kiddies. It does. And, yesterday, some of it oozed out of our unctuous, baby-faced Prime Minister.

RE: Sam White says:“Did we see the same let-it-pass behaviour when they were asking about Duffy-gate?”

I don’t recall anything remotely like ‘let-it-pass’ behaviour. And Duffy-gate? Where was the scandal? Not even Liberals had a problem with the Duffer being entitled to his entitlements-I mean, how could they? Only in Liberal/Progressive circles would it be considered scandalous (not to mention; unheard of) to use your own &/or private money, instead of taxpayers’ money, to repay debts.

Usually a client will relieve in writing. It’s my understanding that sollicitor-client privilege is not waived by general comments made in a public forum. Probably more debatable if the comments concern the nitty gritty but I still have my doubts.

“I have met with Minister Wilson-Raybould a couple of times already since arriving in B.C. yesterday. We spoke about our shared goals for our country and for this government. She confirmed for me a conversation we had this Fall where I told her directly that any decisions on matters involving the director of public prosecutions were hers alone.”

Question 1. a) Why is Mr. feminist in chief speaking FOR Jody Wilson-Raybould?

When he’s the guy who controls whether or not she can speak publicly by not waiving solicitor-client privilege and using his majority to block her from appearing before committee (and can use his majority to turn Wednesday’s committee hearing into nothing more than a useless PR exercise) he can pretty much claim anything he wants now can’t he.

Here’s where Trudeau started to feel comfortable and became so Balsy. The Norman case had him convinced he could bury almost anything. He was so sure of it he moved on to the SNC file with the same plan. Now the Norman case is unraveling and so too is the SNC. He’s in a jam. His weekend meetings with Raybould was more like a negotiation. “ we talked about issues we both agree on”, seriously? He talked she listened hopefully she also recorded the entire thing.

“What else was said? Did anyone take notes? We know from the Vice-Admiral Norman trial – where, yesterday, we learned that PMO had attempted to interfere with the prosecution, too – that note-taking is frowned upon in the rarefied air of the Prime Minister’s Office. I’ll bet, however, the Minister of Justice and her staff took notes. Where are said notes? Anyone done an ATIP yet? Why not, if not?”

And the judge in the Norman case didn’t seem all to impressed with that little admission by the Crown did she?

It’s rarely a good idea for any politician to go off-script during a PR crisis like this, and *never* when he’s as inept at it as Junior. His dad could have managed it, probably…Harper, Chretien, Mulroney as well; they could all think on their feet, were reasonably intelligent and, most importantly, not prone to panicking and blurting out something stupid (looking at you, Martin) which would make the situation even worse.

This would be a great time for JWR to make her move, if she’s going to.

Nor why you were fired from a high profile cabinet position is considered a big deal (again, I’m sure Art will excuse JWR from thinking it was a big deal.). Art obviously has a different interpretation of what a ‘big deal’ is than some us that see it as a big deal.

AG: well my people are telling me there’s no justice when a company can use the same formula to get out of a problem that got them in to the problem in the first place -i.e. illegal bribes and donations. A DPA requires the offender to stop its wrongdoing but this DPA , could be seen -at the very least , as a reward for the very wrongdoing it’s supposed to stop. ….A DPA requires my consent and I’m not giving it

“She says she has hired a former Supreme Court judge to tell her what she can say about her dealings with the prime minister on the SNC-Lavalin affair” so does anyone think that what she needs advice on is how much she can gush about what a supportive boss he is and how dreamy he is? Funny thing…2 years ago which North American leader would you have picked to have to resign in disgrace? I think the essential problem is that we elected someone who is not smart enough. A sufficiently intelligent person could have foreseen how much jeopardy he was getting into pressuring the AG to fix things for SNC-Lavalin. I doubt he had any nefarious intent or had an opportunity to profit personally ….he was just too limited in intellect to think it through…..predicting the future is a mugs game but I believe our drama teacher in chief will not be the next liberal PM of Canada

When I see Warren’s lawyer mind parce Trudeau’s comments (which would have fooled me) and point out his intention to hoodwink the public, I again sense that our guardians of the Canadian constitution and Canadian law, are not asleep at the wheel. I wonder if Trudeau and Butts are aware of what they are facing? It’s one thing to fool guys like me, but they won’t fool the pros.

He says she had a responsibility to speak up, while he simultaneously refuses to say solicitor-client privilege no longer applies – which would allow her to speak up. #LavScam #cdnpoli

I wonder how happy the laurentian elite is having this doofus scion defending their corrupt feudal ethos.

And to have the hand-picked poster child of progressive virtue signalling cabinet appointee – a member of the group of Canadians who have suffered the most from their “management” of the country – about to stick the shive in must really be a shock.

I honestly believe he doesn’t think through what he’s saying and his main communication goal is to say nice things even if they make no sense.

Like when he replied that if he appointed cabinet by merit instead of gender equality there would be a lot more women. In his head he thought it sounded nice because he was implying there were more qualified women than men, however it didn’t occur to him that it also implied he passed over qualified women in favour of u derwualified men.

It’s worked for him mostly until now because nobody called him on it.

That’s gonna be a big problem for them because the kid gloves are off now.

“There’s gonna be a big problem for them because the kid gloves are off now.”

Agreed. Even the likes of CBC News and Rosie Barton won’t be able to downplay and bury this one. Although they’re doing their damndest – latest headline on the CBC website is “Jody Wilson-Raybould Quits Trudeau’s Cabinet – How Big a Threat Is She?”

Yes, because the minister resigning on a point of principle is the problem here. The official organ of the Laurentian Elite never fails to disappoint.

A competent actor can memorize a script and communicate it in a manner set out by the director. It takes a superior actor to ad lib in a convincing manner.

Over the course of the last 3+ years, the person playing the role of Prime Minister has demonstrated that he is but a competent actor. Whenever the Justin Trudeau has not been provided a script by the PMO, he finds himself hip deep, and sinking, in excrement.

Typical mansplaining response ….. but we had this conversation and I never heard any concerns?

Just because he didn’t hear them doesn’t mean they weren’t expressed . In any event , when they spoke in October it would have been right before the start of the preliminary hearing ( started October 29) imagine the conversation:
PM : but JWR these SNC guys , they’re “friends of ours”
We’ve got this legislation now that would really help these “friends of ours” so is this preliminary really necessary?
A DPA would be really good for our country and our party

So who will be the fall person in this scandal? The Liberals will protect Gerald Butts to the bitter end as he conjured Trudeau’s false brand. JWR proved too intelligent for the setup. Butts likely thought he was checking off two meta progressive boxes in appointing her to an important cabinet position, but failed to consider that she could out Machiavelli him.

I am sure a lot of Conservatives are breathing a sigh of relief they didn’t chose him as leader. They would struggle just to hold the 99 seats they won last time and in fact he might damage them so much 2027 would be the earliest they could return to office. While I am skeptical Scheer can win, I at least think as long as he doesn’t do anything too stupid they should do better than the 99 seats they won in 2015 and certainly winning in 2023 is plausible.

Bernier comes across as a dimwitted, somewhat moronic version of Farage and his UKIP in the UK. So dimwitted is our Maxime he cannot understand what he doesn’t understand in the first place. And his personal cluelessness is infamous – “Oh my girlfriend has my cabinet notes. I think . Now where did I put them?” A dumbass bigot – the worst kind – unable to comprehend much beyond some vague notion about something or another about “foreigners” and whatever it is, he doesn’t like it. He cannot even figure out when he’s lost an argument, so tiny is his intellect. What that says about his supporters is troubling – shall we merely say that none are ever likely to win a Nobel prize.

As a Scheer supporter during the leadership race (and now) I’m woefully glad that Maxime is not the leader. I will admit that I put him on my leadership ballot in 5th place. The reason: 5th place would basically do no damage in the race. My ballot: Scheer, Raitt, O’Toole, Trost (he wants to defund the CBC – and so do I – no free society needs a public broadcaster), then Bernier. My recollection after that is foggy. He was a popular candidate among the twitter basement dwellers but that now goes to show that their impact is minimal. That’s why I think his new party will have a minimal (if any) impact on our 2019 results. I think, however, they are having an impact on Burnaby South because he’s running a popular candidate and if her support would go to our candidate we would actually be in the lead. Like, by a lot. That’s troubling because we need (and Canada needs) Nathan Cullen to lead the NDP because he seems to be the only one over there with a head on his shoulders.

The point I’m trying to make is that while one of the biggest political scandals in Canadian history is playing out in front of his eyes, Maxime still wants to play the anti-identity politics game. Yes, we as conservatives don’t like the idea of using identity as a lever to push or pull public policy. But, that’s not the focus right now. He’s barely made any comments on this unprecedented level of corruption at the highest levels of government. If his “team” were his advisors as the leader we’d be looking at another 4 years + of #TeamTrudeau which would and should be a nightmare. Andrew Scheer has a really good team behind him who know what buttons to press and when. Boy, am I happy with the choices I made at the time.

This whole issue is a sideshow to a much bigger, much longer running travesty…

In most of the ROC “Bombardier” is a four letter word. Now “SNC Lavalin” has joined its ranks.

Sadly most in the ROC are not aware that the latter is a far more corrupt and pernicious corporate entity than the former and that it has been at forefront of the economic decline of Quebec and Montreal over the past 65 years.

Meanwhile in Quebec many hail it as a the pinnacle of Quebec Inc. – something they consider a success.

Nothing could be further from the truth as much of the Quebec economy is now either heavily subsidized, protected by some of the highest tariff walls in the developed world or globally notorious as being corrupt or a combination of the three.

That this country is two solitudes is no better illustrated than this area. Quebecers seem to think it highly offensive that a company that engaged in serial, years-long criminal activity with some of the most evil people on the planet should be prosecuted or in any way harmed because “Jobs!!” “Pension exposure!!” .

Meanwhile the ROC – and the rest of the world for that matter – see it for what it is. And that it is dragging the rest of the country and Confederation down with it.

And here we have the LPC the party that, except for a brief interlude where the Mulroney Tories stole their playbook, has provided political cover for this Laurentian Mafia for all these decades and looks to be renewing the consigliere contract with Quebec Inc. for another 50 years…

Many on the ROC have compared Quebec and its underperformance economically with Greece. They are wrong. The comparable is Sicily.

The ties that bind this Confederation together have always been weak. By definition it is a reactionary construct. And it is due to its weakness and the fear of its collapse that it has been vulnerable to extortion and demands that rules be bent or broken.

Acceding to those demands has bought short-term continuation of the Union but weakens it further still. Our leaders must either stand up to these demands at some point or this Confederation is doomed.

Clearly the LPC and its leadership (if that is the right term) are not going to do that. So let’s be blunt. The rule of this country by the LPC is an existential threat to the future of this country.

Bang on, Gord. This has been one of the central problems in Canada since the 1970s. Quebec is the tail that wags the dog, and every political party lets itself be wagged.

It was hilarious (in a bizarre sad way) to see a member of the Quebec government on TV last night, claiming that if this had happened to a company in any other province, there would be hand-wringing about lost jobs. Uh, no – if this had happened in any other province, the company would have been shut down ages ago. Quebec is where you set up shop if you have a flawed and/or corrupt business model that needs government support.

My thoughts as well. I also don’t like his stand on ‘supply management’; it appears that he was bought and paid for by the dairy industry during the last leadership convention. The real conservatives left the so-called ‘Progressive Conservative Party’ for very similar reasons: Canada just doesn’t need two Liberal parties even when one pretends to be something else.

Yes, yes, I know…Canada just isn’t a naturally ‘conservative’ country, it’s true, but you have to at least make the effort to distinguish yourselves from the other guys. Stephen Harper walked a fine line between what he wanted to do and what he actually *could* do; he didn’t always get it right, but at least he tried. Scheer, not so much.





Vancouverois says: 

February 15, 2019 at 11:50 pm

Exactly. Scheer seems to be steering the CPC back to the Mulroneyist policies that split it so spectacularly in two in the 1993 election, and gave rise to another Quebec referendum.

We even have Maxime Bernier playing the role of Preston Manning (which is odd, but there it is).

I am very worried that Scheer will win the next election, and go on to revive the moribund separatist movement by catering to it in a pointless and destructive quest for votes. There is absolutely no need for him to do so, but that seems to be the track he’s on. And I’m horrified.







Jim R says:

Well, the CPC’s proposal (which I do NOT support) can be best described as pandering. However, there’s nothing illegal about it, in contrast to the allegations concerning the PMO.

Ditto for the NDP, who are apparently prepared to take the pandering to the next level.

Having said that, I can’t disagree with them being “all uniquely terrible in their own ways”.

Examples that prove the rule. I can probably name ten or more for every one you do. And the ones I would be naming are the core of Quebec’s business elite.

Montreal and Quebec are in decline – have been for over 60 years. Montreal is a shabby shadow of itself- once a far greater city than Toronto probably in the top five in North America, now a backwater – ruined by these companies that prey on québécois xenophobia for money and legislative support.

This is a great shame/scandal as Montreal is a beautiful place with enormous potential- squandered. Turning a blind eye to the corruption THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD SEES again proves my point and should sadden and discourage anyone who cares about the future of this Confederation.

According to Thomas Cromwell’s bio he was, in 2017, appointed by the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation to be a “Trudeau mentor”. Today he has been hired by Ms Wilson-Reynauld as her advisor in the current state of affairs. How can that be? What on Earth is going on, here?

Trudeau moves to shore up Liberal caucus support as SNC-Lavalin controversy continues

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has moved to shore up support in his Liberal caucus as the aftershocks of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s resignation from cabinet rocked both Parliament Hill and members of his own party.

Multiple caucus sources told CBC News that Trudeau convened an extraordinary caucus meeting by telephone Tuesday evening to reassure them that nothing untoward had taken place in his office’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould over the SNC-Lavalin case when she was justice minister.

But unlike the party’s normal caucus meetings, this was a one-way call — with Trudeau doing the talking. Caucus members were not able to ask Trudeau questions. MPs were told to follow up with the PMO or regional offices.

Is there any possibility that JWR did not resign right away because she saw the writing on the wall? Meaning as long as she was still AG, SNC Lavalin would not get a DPA, but if she resigned, JT would use this as an opportunity to get an agreeable AG in there.

Good thing Brison suddenly wanted out of public life, allowing JT the opportunity to shuffle…

That might explain why she stayed on as AG – or maybe it was just personal ambition.

Ambition could also explain why she accepted the Veteran Affairs demotion. (I’m sure she was also subjected to a lot of pressure about sticking together for the sake of the Liberal party.) While it’s slimy for Trudeau to use it against her, there’s an element of truth to the idea that she should not have continued to serve in the Cabinet of a PM she knew was so corrupt.

I still have to admire her timing, though. ^_^

So it wasn’t a problem when she was appointed Justice Minister.

And it hasn’t been a problem for the three plus years she was Justice Minister.

It only became a problem after she refused PMO pressure to interfere in a court case.

That would be a lot more convincing if we’d heard more of that suggestion at the time. Particularly from the Prime Minister himself. And perhaps if he’d put her into a higher-profile portfolio instead of Veteran Affairs, or instead identified Veteran Affairs as a high priority for the future (as if he would…).

As it is, it seems that the PMO brain trust decided instead to lay the groundwork for the rumours about her being an overrated diva:
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-cabinet-shuffle-says-little-about-jody-wilson-raybould-and/

Reminds me of the rumours Harvey Weinstein of #MeToo fame would spread to undermine the careers of actresses who refused to have sex with him: “she’s difficult to work with – and not all that talented, really.”

Not being able to speak French is a major impediment in Federal politics. However, Justin Trudeau’s AIM was to negotiate reconciliation with a minister who understands indigenous needs (although not a monolithic group) so it would be appropriate that the minister speak one of the +10 language families of indigenous Canadians! Is that shelved?

Anyway, a lot of people were complaining about duel roles. I just wonder how the AG can be non-partisan? Separate the roles out between Minister and AG. What hat was she wearing when the PMO applied pressure?

A question for WK and maybe even Matt. John Robson had a great column today in the NP about what exactly happens to normally good people after they take their seats in Parliament.
My question is, who exactly would make the tactical decision to stonewall and divert the Opposition, as well as go after JWR’s character with a well thought out whisper campaign.
Would it be safe to assume the PM would have to be in on these meetings? I have a hard time believing that this sort of crap is limited to the Liberal party, so, just curious how this kind of sausage is made.

I think some extrapolation is required- it’s not that she doesn’t speak french it’s that she doesn’t understand french meaning she doesn’t understand THE french, who, as far as I can tell, are fine with turning a blind eye to corruption since there’s a rule of lawy way to do that now and if this was any other province it would’ve been a done deal and thousands of jobs wouldn’t be at risk.

Of course here in Alberta , where thousands of jobs have already been lost, there hasn’t even been an attempt to sneak some legislation in an omnibus bill that would provide for a rule of lawy way to get the shovels digging a pipeline – I guess that’s the oil patches bad for not funnelling large illegal campaign donations the liberals way

To be fair, the Prime Minister in Crosbie’s time was more interested in supporting the separatist movement than in fighting it, so his not speaking French may even have been an asset.

They are right that there are legal issues coming up in Quebec. But if that was a reason, why didn’t they just say so openly last month?

The very sad part is that JT has ushered us into an era of three or four solitudes. The SNC files resonates very differently in Quebec from the ROC.

@SadsadCanadian the four solitudes is yours alone to bare. Perched from inside your head is a tinier version of yourself inside which sits an even smaller version of you, inside which sits a romantic on a laptop. The vast majority of Canadians understand the sitch differently: 1) indigenous reconciliation is a winding path not a straight line, 2) that gender equality merely begins with symbolic guestures as such it doesn’t end with a cabinet shuffle, 3) Laurier’s two solitudes is about centres of political power not actually about the everyday people (the true bosses) English French or otherwise.
4) SNC Lavalin corruption needs to be tackled with precision; deal with the offending decision makers (retired or not). The company can threaten capital
Flight, it’s balance sheet is full of redeployable assets; it’s just a waste of everyone’s time to inhibit future contract acquisition, as such the DPA makes a lot of sense.

Come October be surprised; a split right with the PPC resonating as the balance of power. The Scheer Tories will get a buzz cut. Jag meet with meet his maker (career-wise) and the Sunnyways will continue. Campaigns matter.

For them, all of this is merely manufactured outrage and inconvenience. They don’t see that they are the direct cause and that by now, massive firings are no longer enough. People want this PM’s political hide. Recovery is no longer a realistic outcome.

They had their chance at accountabilty and deliberately blew it. And the PM was foolish enough to give those underlings carte-blanche. Ouch! Now they get to take him straight down with the rest of them.

Five ways in which it is leaving, and will leave, an impact:Indigenous people. I am the proud father to an amazing indigenous young woman; I work with First Nations across Canada. I am disgusted by what Justin Trudeau did, and is doing, to the amazing indigenous leader named Jody Wilson-Raybould. Indigenous people do not trust Trudeau, now, and they’re saying so.
Women. The sexist and condescending way in which Jody has been treated – and still continues to be, as seen in this morning’s Star, and last week in the Canadian Press and Global News – is repellant. It is noteworthy that the Liberals who are paying tribute to Jody are almost all women – include ones in Trudeau’s cabinet.
The Liberal Party. This web site attracts four million visitors a year. On social media, like Twitter, I get about a half-million “impressions” daily. That’s a fair number of people – and I can tell you that many of my readers are Liberals. They are telling me they are disgusted by Trudeau and his PMO – and shocked by how badly they have handled this mess (eg. sending out the clueless Justice Committee chair to say Jody didn’t deserve to be in cabinet because she didn’t speak French – which will be a big hit in English Canada).
The Conservatives. Andrew Scheer knows this is his moment, and he has seized it. The Tory leader hasn’t looked this determined, this focussed – and frankly this Prime Ministerial – since he became his party’s leader. Gone is the smirk, and there’s an undeniable gravitas to the guy, now. For his party, PMO’s attempts to destroy Jody Wilson-Raybould represents an opportunity, too – it allows them to address the allegation that they are indifferent to women and indigenous people.
The New Democrats. Jagmeet Singh is going to win that by-election in B.C. – because B.C. is sickened by what has been done to Jody. Meanwhile, his colleague Nathan Cullen has been simply extraordinary in prosecuting the case against the Liberal government – and it will reveal itself in the polls, soon enough. And a rise in NDP fortunes means a drop in Liberal support, always.

Will Justin Trudeau lose the election? It’s too soon to tell. But the poll I’ve heard about suggests strongly the answer is this:

<li><strong>&nbsp;Indigenous people.</strong> &nbsp;I am the proud father to an amazing indigenous young woman; I work with First Nations across Canada. &nbsp;I am disgusted by what Justin Trudeau did, and is doing, to the amazing indigenous leader named Jody Wilson-Raybould. &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/13/indigenous-leaders-criticize-trudeau-over-jody-wilson-raybould-scandal_a_23669077/"">Indigenous people do not trust Trudeau, now, and they’re saying so.</a></li>
<li><strong>Women.</strong> &nbsp;The sexist and condescending way in which Jody has been treated – <a href=""https://twitter.com/kinsellawarren/status/1096226811069968384"">and still continues to be, as seen in this morning’s <em>Star</em></a>, and last week in the Canadian Press and Global News – is repellant. &nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/kinsellawarren/status/1096226149808496640"">It is noteworthy that the Liberals who are paying tribute to Jody are almost all women – include ones in Trudeau’s cabinet.</a></li>
<li><strong>The Liberal Party. &nbsp;</strong>This web site attracts four million visitors a year. &nbsp;On social media, like Twitter, I get about a half-million “impressions” daily. &nbsp;That’s a fair number of people – and I can tell you that many of my readers are Liberals. &nbsp;They are telling me they are disgusted by Trudeau and his PMO – and shocked by how badly they have handled this mess (eg. <a href=""http://warrenkinsella.com/2019/02/revealed-why-the-chair-of-the-house-justice-committee-thinks-jody-was-demoted/"">sending out the clueless Justice Committee chair to say Jody didn’t deserve to be in cabinet because she didn’t speak French – which will be a big hit in English Canada</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The Conservatives.</strong> &nbsp;Andrew Scheer knows this is his moment, and he has seized it. &nbsp;<a href=""https://globalnews.ca/video/4949489/scheer-says-trudeau-should-let-wilson-raybould-speak-for-herself"">The Tory leader hasn’t looked this determined, this focussed – and frankly this <em>Prime Ministerial</em> – since he became his party’s leader.</a> &nbsp;Gone is the smirk, and there’s an undeniable <em>gravitas</em> to the guy, now. &nbsp;For his party, PMO’s attempts to destroy Jody Wilson-Raybould represents an opportunity, too – it allows them to address the allegation that they are indifferent to women and indigenous people.</li>
<li><strong>The New Democrats.</strong> &nbsp;Jagmeet Singh is going to win that by-election in B.C. – because <a href=""https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/opinion/letters/wilson-raybould-a-credit-to-b-c-1.23635333"">B.C. is sickened by what has been done to Jody. </a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, his colleague Nathan Cullen has been simply extraordinary in prosecuting the case against the Liberal government – and it will reveal itself in the polls, soon enough. And a rise in NDP fortunes means a drop in Liberal support, always.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will Justin Trudeau lose the election? It’s too soon to tell. &nbsp;But the poll I’ve heard about suggests strongly the answer is this:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>

I am less than enthused about any of the extant options for government. Green looking more attractive than ever. JWR and Philpott either need to commandeer the liberal ship, or drag themselves and maybe Cullen over to Greens for preposterous political theatre that will entertain me and encourage voting for the fourth option, or whatever they are.

I could have supported the Jim Harris Greens. Way too many wingnuts in the current iterations, and May has a track record of bizarre behaviour. Some of her greatest hits: “nobody in their right mind is for abortion”; Stephen Harper on climate change = worse than Chamberlain’s appeasement of Nazis; she’s bought into the WiFi tinfoil hat nonsense; she supports pseudo-science like homeopathy; presenting 9/11 Truther petitions in the House; defended Jian Ghomeshi; and of course the topper, getting loaded at the Press Gallery Dinner and praising Omar Khadr.

No thanks. “Spoiled ballot” is looking pretty good right now.

I don’t like anything that Maxime Bernier stands for, but I suspect he will do much better than most people anticipate. In about week 3 of the campaign, I think people will be stunned at his popularity and he will eat into Scheer’s seat count big time.

February 15, 2019 at 8:52 pm

I really don’t know. I expect his message will resonate with many voters who feel that the Conservative party takes them for granted and has left them behind. On the other hand, those voters may still be willing to give Scheer a chance because they’re so desperate to get rid of Trudeau.

I also don’t know how Bernier’s vote breaks down. I expect he has the most traction in ridings where the Conservatives already win by very large margins. If so, under our FPTP system he could easily siphon off 20% of the vote in a given riding and still let the Conservative win with 40%.

Interesting times… alas.

Trudeau is accussed of trying to manipulate the prosecution in one case in the name of the economy, while Doug Ford is accussed of trying to get a friend appointed head of the OPP to manipulate all future investigations that might impact the government.

If there is going to be a caucus revolt, the Ontario Conservatives should be the first in line for this reason (plus many of thier moves since being elected has turned into disasters).

Um, you do realize that with the charges SNC is facing (s. 3 or 4 of the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act) if the prosecution were looking at a deferred prosecution agreement they CANNOT consider “economic interests” as a justification for allowing a DPA?

No. Doug Ford is accused of trying to get a friend appointed head of the OPP. Period. Full stop. The rest is your speculation.

Taverner may or may not be qualified for the job – he certainly didn’t meet the initial criteria – but he is a decorated senior officer with a stellar record. You don’t get to smear a man’s integrity like that without a shred of evidence.

#Lavscam is about things being done in the shadows, including slipping the DPA law into a massive budget omnibus.

I detest Ford, but the attempted Taverner appointment isn’t remotely worse than #Lavscam.

Ford’s attempt to appoint Taverner was stupid and clumsy, but it was done in open. Public, media, and opposition pressure thankfully put the brakes on it.

As a Conservative who loves your articles and website because of your insight, I am amazed how the Liberal Party and brand has imploded. This is a self inflicted wound that could have been prevented. Disgusting how the former AG is being treated.
I assumed Trudeau would get back in with a majority in October 2019( like most Conservatives) but now I see a ray of hope that the true Natural Governing Party of Canada (Conservatives), could in fact form the next government.

Self inflicted because of Trudeau. The dye was cast when they went with looks (Trudeau) over brains (Garneau). At the time, we didn’t think Canadians would be stupid enough to vote for someone based only on looks, but it happened what followed was inevitable, and we have only ourselves (well those 40% who voted Liberal) to blame.

See Andrew Coyne in the National Post. Parses the law. The attorney general would have had to violate the law to appease Trudeau and direct prosecution to give them a stern talking to instead. She’s the top lawyer in the country and he demands that she ignore and violate the law to appease the Montreal moneybags. This is absolutely disgraceful. How is this not a criminal act by one or more people in the PMO?

An overarching thought is that Trudeau and Butts and Telford etc. didn’t quite realize that their 2015 victory was due a lot more to exhaustion with Harper than it was to people really buying into their Sunny Ways. I think they may be getting a crash course in reality this week.

The worst thing is, you just know that there IS going to be a next round. I just don’t understand the strategy here, if there actually is a strategy. If you feel that you absolutely, positively must tell the public a lie to bail yourself out of an untenable situation, then you really need to COMMIT to that lie. If it’s a “he said-she said” scenario, that’s all you need to do. STICK TO IT. Abandoning your previous position and trying another tactic is just admitting to being a liar….and when you do that, why would anyone believe your next statement either? Or the one after that?

Next thing you know, you’ve become as trustworthy as Donald Trump(but without the advantages he enjoys).

I hope this leads to Gerald Butts being dumped, he has been a disaster both in Ontario and federally. While its too early to say what will happen federally, Trudeau unlike your former boss Chretien seems to be good a pouring gas on problems rather than putting the flame out. I believe Chretien had similar problems erupt multiple times, but managed to not have it hurt him. To be fair he didn’t have to worry about 24 hour social media so that helped too, but also seemed to have better instincts.

@FredFlinstonesMistress, the translation is: “no pressure is on you Jody to weigh the options which include the DPA that we just slid into an omnibus bill…it’s your choice. No pressure.” Which is technically not pressure, but plausible enough to tell Fife about in revenge for the demotion.

Remember too that before this scandal, everyone said JWR was underperforming as minister?

JWR’s father said the real reason this has blown up is she was demoted. And so she obviously conflated her own self interest with the better half of a species (women) and indigenous “never heard of JWR” people (1.2million, 70 languages, 10 language families).

Most Canadians find this scandal utterly confusing. It’s the Carvilles & Roves du Canada that want this car crash to matter. Only fools and politicos care. Harsh, I know. The real heroes are the everyday Canadians that focus on delivering value, and who (through the grace of Netflix) have dodged the curse of caring too much.

The poll I just read said Liberals -5 points down. So the message is clear, either this poll is recency bias OR american style news cycles work. Let’s face it, this is the Canadian equivalent of the Mueller investigation. And this scandal will drag on into the election.

The real lesson is that insiders crave our very own AmericAna style narratives. Hot nasty unprovable interactions, anonymous versus confidential sources. Why? Because it moderately increases engagement which the media infer means democracy is working, heightening relevance and ad revenue.

JWR along with the media capitalized on the ‘obstruction of justice’ narrative. Following that logic, this election should be about Our wall = the Pipeline that Andrew Scheer said he might be able to build. It should be about taxing the rich AOC-style the way Jagmeet can overcome his mediocrity. But that too would take Courage to offer real choices in such a diverse country.

The inconvenient truth, the gore, blood red truth is that the LPC will pickup seats in Quebec and be the foil to the Ford government, Trump and all the haters who they’ve slammed the door on. Priority is to sweep this under the rug and craft a masterful campaign when it matters: to a. implode Bubble Boy Andy who, sources say, sniffs the PMs chair for leadership insights. The wolf that is Bernier will pop Bubble Boy Andy.

And a new Liberal Majority is on the way; fall in line or get out de way!

All of the quotes found in the poll below are real. They are actual statements made by Justin Trudeau or his fart-ctachers. They said those things.

As I always remind you, gentle reader, that hoary old Watergate-era maxim is as true now as it was then: it’s never the break-in, it’s always the cover-up. And the cover-up of #LavScam is in full effect. You only have to have watched that abortion of justice, at this week’s “Justice” Committee, to see it on display, in real time.

But it isn’t working. The Trudeau Party – because they’re not the Liberal Party, to many of us – have dropped five percentage points in a week. Another Liberal MP retired yesterday, and another one the day before that. I am hearing from Grits, all over, and they are disgusted by the racist, sexist, almost-certainly-illegal way in which Trudeau’s party dealt with Jody. And they plan to donate no time or money to the 2019 election effort – or even vote for another party.

Anyway. Here’s the poll. It’s funny and sad. Funny, because Trudeau has overseen the worst crisis communications effort since Watergate.

Sad, because all of these things were actually said.

Is it self serving when the EDC could be out billions because Harper approved those guarantees back in 2011 and 2012 after the Company had already been charged and acknowledged the illegal stuff. Maybe, just maybe, YOUR PM is much smarter than you.

Terence,

You know better than yours truly that economic considerations, such as maintaining jobs, are entirely foreign to DPA eligibility criteria. In other words, a valid DPA cannot be negotiated if solely based on that consideration.

You raise the issue of individuals having already been criminally charged. Fair point. But does that in any way reflect the corporate accountability that many Canadians expect under such circumstances? I leave it to readers to judge.

As to commenting on EDC, I will concede the point as analysis of same is way beyond my pay grade.

In short, the PMO needs to release publicly other DPA eligibility conditions applicable to this proposed agreement.

https://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-trudeau-and-wilson-raybould-shouldnt-even-have-been-talking-about-snc-lavalin

If he’s correct, then there was never any decision for JWR to make at all – the Director of Public Prosecutions had already made it, based on the requirements set out in the law the Liberals themselves had just enacted.

Any discussions would have been not of whether the AG should instruct the DPP to use the law; but whether the AG should instruct the DPP to *contravene* the law.

It seems that while Trudeau did sneak the DPA provision into an omnibus bill on behalf of his SNC-Lavalin buddies, it used phrasing (presumably based on similar existing provisions in the US and UK) that still leaves SNC-Lavalin ineligible for one.

Garbage. Total garbage. This excuse just doesn’t fly.

https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/snc-lavalins-demise-would-not-be-the-calamity-its-defenders-claim/

As it turns out, at least some of the ‘former’ leaders seem to be getting away with it anyway; but even if they weren’t, punishing the company as it deserves under the law would hardly be a catastrophe. It would result in some short-term dislocation – like other layoffs do – but in the end it would simply mean that SNC-Lavalin employees would eventually be hired by other, more honest companies. And those more honest companies would be getting the contracts that SNC Lavalin so dishonestly obtained through bribery.

The claim that companies and PMO staffers should be entitled to ignore ethics laws so long as they claim they’re saving jobs is despicable. It’s a weak and transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable. If you’re going to go that route, why have any ethics laws at all?

A bit like Derek said, there were so many future progressive possibilities and now all that has been needlessly squandered just because Trudeau couldn’t fire his friends and be quick about it.

At this stage, given the stream of lies and half truths, an independent investigation is required, open/transparent, as Trudeau has demonstrated he is unwilling to release the whole truth

This is no longer the Liberal Party of Chretien or Martin

They were trying to pervert the course of a criminal prosecution for corruption. In this case I would say the break in is as bad or worse than the cover up.

The Watergate comparison is apt, though….other than this is much, much, much worse than a third rate burglary.

Gerald Butts could have pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould’s to drop (change) charges. Butts resigning could make a good part of the issue go away.

However, demoting Jody Wilson-Raybould’s is the decision of the PM. Either Trudeau says that he is so incompetent he followed Butts’ orders in running the government, or he is responsible for demoting her and must give a reason.

There is also the possibility that Trudeau (and possibly others in the PMO) also pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould’s.

If Justin Trudeau has lost control and PMO / PCO is running amok, then a silent coup d’état has occurred. Indeed, foreign elements have achieved near-state capture. While there is time, we must assert our revolutionary right and purge jackals like Iqra Khalid. Better to die as free people than live out our remaining days being harangued by such degenerates.

If there is factual evidence available, have at it..

Meanwhile, our money is on the astonishing coincidence that all the ‘players’ in the Lavalin drama, scandal, bombshell, chaos blah blah are equally embedded or immersed (take your pick) Ex Commander Norman criminal trial.. aside of course from mr Norman, ms Marie Henein and the judge.. who it seems in an open court has already remarked on the obvious signs of COLLUSION between the Prosecution Office and the PMO

Power Play interviewed Jagmeet Singh in Burnaby last night, yes.. February 18 – 5:40 PM – live to air on CTV – and he said while seemingly exressing he had just become aware Butts had resigned, so loud and clear my head snapped around.. ‘Trudeau fired her’

CTV ? No objection, correction or comment from the interviewer (woman with shaggy shoulder cut blond hair.. perhaps a holiday fill in) – Accuracy is no longer important in MainStream Media.. A specific comment Bob Fife made life to air was filtering into other network reports within 30 minutes.. essentially verbatim. That’s what I call ‘cut and paste’ lazy ‘new journalism’ .. echo chamber amateur. We see it and hear it are fed it all the time now. Political panels are so often filled solely by highly partisan Public Relations agency ‘experts’.. wonderful .. Denise Batters shrieks ‘Chaos’ .. the sky is falling .. oh deary me ..

.. ‘the only remaining question was whether Ms Wilson-Reybould would publicly instruct prosecuters to instead cut a deal’

Seems such an odd inclusion or conclusion.. or just more ‘term salad’ ? Is that a formal or legal stage or option under Criminal Law. ‘cut a deal’ ? Is there flexibility or negotiation build into Criminal Law, perhaps via the new amendment Ms Wilson-Reybould introduced – which was then passed into law ? My understanding is she was the author or engineer of the amendment, so she could hardly be unaware of the scope.. & surely the PM, Privy Council & PMO would have been highly intergral to such a legal initiative & examined & aided the evolution of such a specific amendment. Also, was the 10 year bidding exclusion ‘written in stone’ or was there wiggle room in case of a guilty finding? Or was this one of those things that wanders through appeal processes before years down the road, perhaps under a different Government, a different political Party.. you know.. like the same Party but wearing different sweaters.. would have to ‘cut a deal’ on it per Supreme Court..

While “economic impacts” defined most broadly as a “national economic interest” are not to be considered, there is recognition that one public interest purpose is “to reduce the negative consequences of the wrongdoing for persons — employees, customers, pensioners and others — who did not engage in the wrongdoing….” These are more specific economic impacts.

For the most part, I just lurk here, but I have to say that in my 50 years of being in and on the fringes of politics, I’ve not seen anything like this.

I’m befuddled. Bamboozled, even.

I have questions.

It now seems that the media is turning “against” Jody Wilson-Raybould, suggesting that she made a deal to maintain silence in exchange for the departure of Butts.

Warren Kinsella, among others, suggests that is not in her nature.

Frankly, if Warren is wrong and a deal has been made, doesn’t that end badly for all concerned? Doesn’t the PM, the PMO and the Liberal insiders wear even more of the cover-up scandal, save for the part now smeared across JWR?

And, if Warren is right? Doesn’t this look to take the PM, the PMO and the Liberal insiders farther into the abyss?

I have one question for you pundits and war roomers, expecially those who recall the Watergate scandal and cover-up. (Breaking into a campaign office — big freaking deal.) The question is, have you ever seen anything like this, where the story changes daily, and usually from bad to worse?

Cheers,

Will

I believe what we’re seeing now from the LPC is the “getting our story(s) straight” or if you will, “circling the wagons”

I think a good many of them, facing the prospect of possibly not being on the government side of the house by the end of this year, have decided to do what’s necessary to avoid this. At any cost. Hence Mr Butts departure, even though, he “did nothing wrong”.

Unfortunately, and I hope it isn’t true, I think this includes JWR.

So we have a law drafted by JWR that by its terms couldn’t apply to SNC and the PMO, JT and GB all asked her get involved to pressure prosecutors to change their mind? So essentially the prosecutors had to change a public indictment to fit DPA law despite the facts of the case? Stranger by the minute.

.. watching, hearing & reading how MainMedia makes asses of themselves is fascinating.. but when I realize or catch that some of the messaging is actually attempting to lecture me on what to think & why I should ‘see it their way’, well that causes me to lead my war pony from the barn.. and look to its bridle. Being non-partisan is so advantageous kf I want to go guerrilla and get on the warpath

Everyone knows the famous story of Stanfield fumbling the football & subsequent election.. very few know the real facts. When Peter McKay – old sack of hammers himself lurches into our living room to say something to the effect that.. ‘never in Canadian history has an unelected person wielded such political power’ .. we burst out laughing at his pompous ignorance.. We presume he never met Ray Novak.. but the panel host nodded wisely.. Holy Hell !

Presumably the world of Our Parliament will someday soon, again spin on its axis & Andrew Scheer (you know.. the multimillionaire guy we pay for he and his middle class brood’s housing, food, cooking, laundry, transportation, security, all services & expenses.. plus his salary and pension.. ues that sour dour glass half empty guy..) will cease sucking up all the faux outrage and oxygen in the room. Jagmeet Singh (wealthy champion retail Party membership salesman) will be schooled by schoolchildren. Justin Trudeau will put the genie or Pandora back in the jar.. or simply employ Cabinet Confidence to make all kinda ‘go away’ (Harper perfected that countermeasure to transparency) .. and he’ll simply resume business as usual with Gerald Butts ‘working from home until the Norman criminal trial and election are over simultaneously’ while CTV waits & lurks to breathlessly report on what beer cans he or his wife puts out in recycling.. Maybe Party whips can be made extinct and the Phoenix non payment system can be replaced by old school chequebooks.. Gawd willing and the creek don’t flood.. Trudeau will complete the Harper initiatives to extirpate endangered species & threaten all the others.. Scheer will be far worse than either.. as if that was even possible.. and maybe tow trucks can haul the yellow vested truckers back to Alberta and bill Premier in Waiting Jason Kenney !

Thanks to Warren.. for hosting what is probably the most informed & up to date roundtable.. especially re the criminal law aspects, the actual DPA legislation and the various scope the involved players must adhere to .. His other subsequent post to this one – from a ‘real prosecuter’ is a good example..

We know Hope is not a good strategy.. but it may be all we have these days ..

President Trump is quoted as referring to habitually corrupt – habitually failing – countries in Africa and elsewhere as “$hitholes”.

And that Justin Trudeau was “weak” and an “asshole”.

If SNC can treat Canada no differently than Libya – escaping criminal punishment- by presumably similar means – how can anyone here or around the world disagree with the President’s descriptors “$hithole” “weak” and “a$$hole”?

That Canadians largely are mildly agitated with all of this only provides further proof.

Look, the fact is that SNC Lavalin has endured Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from the uncertainty of doing business with tyrannical regimes….the sentencing is key here.

If convicted, SNC Lavalin should get a reasonable sentence. Is what I am writing here PRESSURING YOU into thinking independently? I would expect proportionality to be a principle of our legal system. Assigning blame to an ENTIRE ORGANIZATION for particular top sales people (C-suite folks) is just inexact and un-justice. Similar to attributing all men with #MeToo perpetrators.

After-all, Qadafi Jr completed a PhD thesis at a UK university and the dean of that school swiftly resigned because, oh, the Libyan regime was collapsing (and the extra-judicial killings reflected badly on the school). My point is that the university in question was largely uneffected.

SNC Lavalin should be monitored closely (for its mental health) with triple oversight rather than have its assets liquidated or acquired by a foreign firm…

So if a major oil company deliberately caused a massive oil spill should it be held fully accountable for the damage it caused or should it only pay a small fraction of it?

How about a car manufacturer who knowingly put faulty airbags in cars or put the gas tank in a dangerous place?

Or a gas and electricity company plays all kinds of leveraging games and schemes that illegally boost power costs and share prices should that company be allowed to get away with it?

If SNC Lavalin management causes the company to get smaller and people lose their jobs with the company so be it.

Think of the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenues this corruption by SNC and the government have cost this country. We look like and arguably are a banana republic. Many people – including the LPC – should suffer the full consequences of their actions.

A tip o the hat to Mr Kinsella for providing a forum where this issue can be freely discussed.

What this whole scandal has exposed is the tawdry business of legislators twisting the law to favor one industry in one region and then doing the same to obstruct another in the other end of the country. The determining feature is seat count in the region effected and which party’s MP’s sit in those seats.
Regardless of who said what and when, this picking winners and losers for partisan advantage rankles the electorate. While it may not cause a wholesale abandonment of support for the party in power, it can be honestly said that this is divisive and pits one region against another, its polarizing, and can be described as un-Canadian.
The real detriment is that while the government is obsessed over this dumpster fire of their own creation, the other important stuff like the aluminum and steel tariffs, inter-provincial relations, immigration, dispute with Saudi Arabia, dispute with China, get neglected.
This will not end well.

Trudeau and company know how dangerous her testimony can be. To put it in perspective , if they were a Mafia organization, Jody would need to be in a witness protection program. They fool no one and they will not find peace. I have never seen such unity of pundits who place the integrity of Canada well ahead of partisanship, especially of the ” law breaking ” kind. When our country is under assault, we as Canadians close ranks and stand shoulder to shoulder.

OK, so I’m very supportive of JWR in this whole thing, and aghast at what the Libs (and esp PMO) have done.

However…. I hate phrases like “speak my truth”. What does that even mean?? If you intend to speak THE truth, then say it that way. Truth is truth – there is no “my” truth and “your” truth. Mine and yours relate to opinions, not truth.

I wish she hadn’t used this terminology – it now makes me think we are going to get a lot less clarity than originally intended.

I would have preferred “the” to “my” as well, but don’t kid yourself: There are many truths out there. Most of them come in fractions.

I suspect Trudeau was telling “the truth” when he said he did not “direct” JWR to give SNC a break. Cajole, plead and a host of other verbs — well, that’s another matter.

Likely any other leader would have been done in by now, but Trudeau’s ego will have him hanging on till the very end. He is, after all, Liberal (and by extension, Canadian) Royalty.

I truly think there’s a good chance he truly believes he is above the law.

I can see a few scenarios playing out here.

Smarter members of the power brokers within the LPC get enough caucus on side to force him out early enough to get another leader in place well before October.

They let him hang on to go down to defeat in October, then they start rebuilding the brand.

This whole affair gets glossed over enough and he gets in for another term. This is possible, and liberals must be thanking the heavens daily that Mulcair stepped down to let the hapless Jagmeet take the helm.

As an Albertan (formerly BC’er), part of me would welcome the latter. Another Trudeau term (especially a majority) could set in motion a separation/independence movement that would surprise the ROC with its influence, and more importantly, its seriousness. Strong enough to cause a massive shift in the dynamics of the nation, whether or not it achieves its end goal.

For those that scoff at this, keep underestimating it at your peril. There’s a lot more to it just under the surface than the ROC sees.

594,Warren Kinsella,LavScam Globe stunner: what JWR told cabinet,2019-02-21 10:43:00,Warren,,"…and, as she almost certainly expected, they’re leaking it. They’re waiving the privilege all on their own. And thereby helping her to get her story out.

Man, she is smart. They’re playing checkers – and she always plays chess.

Story here.


Former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould told federal cabinet ministers she believed it was improper for officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to press her to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. out of its legal difficulties, sources say…


On Tuesday, Ms. Wilson-Raybould privately outlined her concerns about the handling of the SNC-Lavalin prosecution to her former colleagues within the confidentiality of cabinet, freed from the bounds of solicitor-client privilege that have restricted her public statements so far.


According to a source with knowledge of the cabinet discussions, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the director of the prosecution service rejected a negotiated settlement with SNC-Lavalin based on how the law applies to the company’s case. The Liberal government had changed the Criminal Code to allow for deferred prosecutions in which a company admits wrongdoing and pays a fine, but avoids a trial. Under Canada’s new deferred-prosecution agreement law, prosecutors are not allowed to consider national economic interests when deciding whether to settle with a company.


Once prosecutors decided in early September to move to trial, Ms. Wilson-Raybould told cabinet she felt it was wrong for anyone – including the Prime Minister, members of his staff and other government officials – to raise the issue with her, the source said. Another source added that Ms. Wilson-Raybould would not budge from her position at the cabinet meeting.


The Liberal source said government officials had also proposed an outside panel of legal experts to recommend a solution to the SNC-Lavalin issue, but Ms. Wilson-Raybould rejected the suggestion","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Since the DPA does not accommodate economic reasons (financial, shareholder considerations…) then what other reasons should it have been granted for SNC Lavalin? Try, undue distribution of punishment amongst 9,000 employees for a few sneaky top performing sales managers!

You get the inpression that most politico/legal hacks have never held jobs with aggressive targets. (Some) successful companies expect employees to bend the rules to meet targets. This should not be a revelation, wow. What to do about it? Punish with precision, obviously.

If the leak is accurate, then we have a case of someone enduring pressure (which she did). But for many reasons, she was shuffled including but not limited to: lack of French, bungling the Inquiry into Missing First Nations and not being a team player on SNC Lavalin…

Cause and effect is a cruel mistress. JWR has her theory but there is more than one variable at play.

Meanwhile,
Hudson Bay Company: deal weilding
The big Five Banks: deal weilding
The big 3 Telecoms: deal weilding
Name a successful Canadian company and I will name you “cultural” entity, protected against market forces from our American cousins. If anything, this scandal helps to clarify the inherent bubbles of inefficiency which create the moldy basis of the Family Compact ‘19.

Seems to suggest that in their haste to get the law on the books that the “smart” people that came up with this brilliant plan neglected to read it.
That would also suggest there was an expected outcome that everyone at the cabinet table, including PMO staff, believed there was concurrence on.
So when the expectations where not happening the AG was pressed as to why, not once, but on numerous occasions by just about everyone that had the ability to make life difficult for her.
So she walked into cabinet and without pointing a finger explained why it would be wrong if anyone even talked to her about it.
Basically then, anyone that has talked to her about it knows they just got a big bullseye drawn on them.

Warren, got any predictions on who might suddenly decide they need to spend more time with their family?

Gord says:

Reading between the lines, my takeaway is that the PM himself didn’t pressure her. He’s probably telling the truth when he says that in his discussions with her, he told her the choice was “hers to make”. She says that it would be “inappropriate” for him to pressure her but apparently stopped short of saying the PM pressured her but rather it was “officials in the Prime Minister’s Office”.

My guess is that, in the interest of keeping up appearances, the PM sent his henchman Butts to do the actual dirty work. Butts then resigns in hopes he won’t be called to testify before a Committee and have to discuss whether the PM essentially ordered him to put pressure on JWR to change her mind.

Sadly, unless the Liberal MPs decide to turn on him, I think the PM is going to wiggle out from under this one.

I think we might be reading into this here. Parsing the graph presented here, JWR doesn’t say that these actors DID “raise the issue” with her; she expresses how wrong it WOULD BE if they did. I still expect JT to wriggle out of this. She got her pound of flesh with Butts’ firing. The Cabinet and caucus doesn’t want more drama eight months away from an election. Better to use this as a way to make their opposition look bad by over-reaching.

Anyway, I suspect no more pissing inside the tent from here on out.

What nobody mentions is the harper era CPC 2006 DPP Act that authorizes the AG to assume the conduct of a prosecution or to direct the DPP to, for example, invite SNC to negotiate a DPA. These authorities persist until a verdict, which could be a year or more from now. No AG decision is “final” until a verdict has been rendered.

I can only speak of my understanding of solicitor-client privilege here in Quebec.

In this jurisdiction, SCP remains in effect even after retirement, legal sanctions such as being disbarred or voluntarily giving up of Barreau membership.

What if former Minister Wilson-Raybould arrives at committee next week and tells them that her counsel (former SCJ Cromwell) has advised her that solicitor-client privilege is not relevant or does not exist in this case, because as the Attorney General, she was the person with authority, the decider, on the matter at hand, and thus, there is no client, since in the matter at hand, she was not acting as or in the position of a lawyer advising a client. And then starts talking.

Was her advocacy that their might be solicitor-client privilege just a mechanism to get to an official forum to speak, and for strategic advantage over the PMO?

There might be privilege, so I can’t speak. But now I understand there is no applicable privilege, so I can speak.

WSISYW,

I wouldn’t go there. IMHO, unless privilege is explicitly waived in writing by PMO, it would be quite a risk to take.

I don’t expect that JWR will say anything in public, or even in private, without that.

What about a reference to the Ontario Court of Appeal re: The Ontario Barristers Act?

Oh good god. I agree that using words like “treason” and “traitor” to describe civil servants or MPs (or PMs) is unhelplful hyperbole. But to state this makes him worry about assassination makes him look ridiculous. Let people who want to throw words like treason around look ridiculous on their own, there’s no need to join them in looking so.

So he just admitted that there was pressure, and perception means squat as the law makes no such distinction. The legal term is influenced and the means test is if someone tried to influence the justice minister.
He admitted that it happened.
The other crap he spouted about assassination should be ignored.
I’m sticking with the theory that the legislation to allow a DPA was stuck in the omnibus bill with the understanding that the expectation that on royal assent SNC would get their application approved. Unfortunately, it appears none of the folks that shepherded the budget bill in Finance actually read it. Likely because they presumed someone else already did, or it came from on high with orders to add to the omnibus legislation.
Regardless, it does appear the Director did read the legislation and did apply the law.
I guess we can thank the chief knob of the privy council for confirming that he was in the know on what the motive was.

“Unfortunately, it appears none of the folks that shepherded the budget bill in Finance actually read it.”

Probably because it didn’t belong buried in a 556 page budget bill, and should have been looked at by a Justice committee or some equivalent thereof.

I’m sure its placement in a omnibus budget bill was just an oversight ????

I guess there was no inappropriate pressure from Trudeau’s hand when he grabbed a lady’s ass. There was no inappropriate pressure from Adam, the goon, Vaughan when he relentlessly harassed Mel Lastman’s wife. There was no pressure from Bob Rae for maligning protests with the most reprehensible terms.

That assasination bit (about the united we roll fringe) was the lead generator i.e the viral headline used to spread the general content of his statement. A Trojan horse of truth that Faith Goldy or any publication can ferment violence through rhetoric. It’s nice marketing because, you know, politicos spread his message on the speculative nature of it.

What hurts more is the huge problem for JWR that if she felt undue pressure, why not resign immediately in September? Where was the noble principle then? It all hinges on whether her demotion was a kick in the teeth for all [insert cultural indicator here] or was it mostly her personal ambitions leading her to leak to Fife, you know, after she discovered the new job sucked?

If it’s the former then the retaliation does not advance the cause of indigenous self-government being written explicitly into the constitution. If it’s the latter, her truth simply airs LPC laundry to harm the party, PM and by extension increases the chances of a (Tory) justice minister that reversed any gains on the indigenous file.

He was clearly on board with the SNC charade and his entire testimony and attitude confirm it I’m my opinion.

And forgive me if I’m wrong about this but if some savvy folks in the MOJ surreptitiously included the posing pill into the DPA regarding ignoring the economic impact, wasn’t that under his watch?

Face it…JWR was pressured. She declined to play ball. She was demoted for her insubordination. The Liberals have offered a plethora of implausible excuses for that. Butts leaves. None of what Mr. Wernick said yesterday can repeal the obvious.

Pretty clear what happened:
SNC-Lavalin was caught red-handed bribing Libyans. Given that bribes, graft, and corruption are the only ways to get things done in that region; no one should be surprised. SNC is hardly the only culprit. In fact, their only problem was getting caught. I’ve worked in Libya….if you don’t pay off the right folks, you don’t get to pay. That applies to most of the countries over there. It’s a lot like Quebec in that respect.

SNC was charged, they knew they were going to be found guilty, and they started sloshing buckets of money into the Liberal Party trying to buy their favour. It worked. the reward was put into an omnibus bill.

The prosecutors didn’t buy into it, and the PMO decided to tell their indigenous AG to play along. She didn’t.

She was then “non-directed” to make an exception; as failing to do so would have serious repercussions for Liberal prospects in the next election…er, I mean…lots of folks in Quebec would lose their jobs.

Gerry, Trudeau, and the PCO tried again, and when that didn’t work, it was determined that a cabinet shuffle was in order. None of the other positions mattered, as long as a chinless “yes-man” from Quebec was named the new AG.

All would be well.

Oops…not so fast. That lady from BC has some grit…..

Let the shit-show begin.

As an aside: Does anyone wonder why the 100,000 jobs ALREADY LOST in ALBERTA don’t matter as much as a few thousands jobs in Quebec? Maybe because there aren’t a lot of Liberal seats to be had in ALBERTA. Besides, Gerry’s whole reason for making Trudeau the PM, was because the virtue-signalling moron we have as a Prime Minister will do as he’s told, and enact Gerry’s agenda. The complete shut-down of the oil sector in Alberta.

Easy peasy

JamesHalifax,

I’m still waiting for some Conservative to tell us why Harper didn’t push a pipeline thru to the coast between 2006 and 2015.

Exactly. Those BC CPC seats. (No need to thank me for clearing this up.)

Ronald,

No problem.

Tides Foundation, \
MoveON.org, Eco-fanatics, indigineous groups, Courts, etc..etc..etc….

It wasn’t lack of effort.

The difference of course, is that Harper and the CPC tried to get oil out of Alberta, whereas the Liberals said they wanted to get the oil out of alberta…while at the same time enacting policies and procedures to see that it will never happen.

You are welcome.

Word is there was much lobbying and pressure on Morneau and staff to insert the DPA into the Omnibus Bill. A type of bill Trudeau promised his government would never bring in.
It’s also said that SNC Lavalin were onto the Director of Public Prosecutions even before the bill got passed, once they knew Morneau had caved. It seems to me it was not only Puglaas who was subjected to undue pressure. The difference is she’s a strong principled individual, as opposed to Morneau who has all the backbone of a limp dishrag.

So to summarize…”Ya I talked to her in December to pressure her to change her mind, but … she never called in the ethics commissioner so it’s all on her.”

Arrogant, dismissive and somewhat twisted thought process which describes how the Trudeau government operates.

Key bits:

“The most mind-boggling thing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick said Thursday didn’t occur during his testimony at the House of Commons justice committee.


Granted, the federal government’s top bureaucrat said some pretty shocking things there, including his bizarre comments about how Canada is essentially going to hell in a hand basket and that someone may even get shot in the next federal election.


But more to the point of what the committee was trying to examine – whether former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or any senior federal officials tried to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin – Wernick’s most outrageous comment came during a scrum with reporters following his testimony.


The privy council clerk admitted at committee that not only was he in a meeting with Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau on Sept. 17 when the three discussed the SNC-Lavalin case – even though a decision to prosecute had already been made – but that Wernick also contacted Wilson-Raybould three months later on Dec. 18 to discuss whether giving SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution was “still an option.”


Wernick was asked by reporters following his testimony why he would contact the attorney general over three months after a decision had been made on the SNC-Lavalin case.


“Because the decision had not already been made,” Wernick said.


The decision had not already been made? Pardon?


The director of public prosecutions Kathleen Roussel made the decision on Sept. 4.”

This is shocking. It means one of two things.
Wernick was as bizarre following his testimony as he was during his testimony – and he got some big facts wrong.
Wernick told the truth – he and the Prime Minister plainly did attempt to push for a sweetheart deal for a huge Liberal Party donor facing a criminal trial.

Did anyone at PMO review tho guy’s speech before he gave it? Did they not think it was a good idea to take out the stuff where Wernick seems to suggest that critics of Justin Trudeau are vomitous murderers?

And did they not realize that the Clerk of the Privy Council planned to confirm the key allegation against Trudeau et al. – that they obstructed justice to benefit SNC-Lavalin?

Well, of course the decision hadn’t been made. A *different* decision had been made, so naturally it didn’t count. It doesn’t count until they get the *right* one.

Are these people actually going to be held accountable? I worry that this is happening too soon – most voters rarely seem to pay any attention to what’s going on between elections – and rarely even during elections, to be frank.

Then again, at the rate things are going here, the scandal may well last until the fall.

I think the saddest thing about Liberals and their supporters is the likely tribalism that lurks within. I’m not an insider of any party, but I get the feeling that Conservatives manage to stay focused on the prize, and not turn against each other as often. Conservatives tend to be more ideologically focused, while Liberals are situational and opportunistic.

I look forward to how this plays out, as more information is revealed. So far, I’m buying into what the ruling government is saying. This is a complex issue – I think government is obligated to take it seriously and weigh all considerations. Seeing it being presented by media influencers as good/bad corrupt/lawful is only further reducing (the already low) faith in governmental institutions.

As for the Wernick thing, well this feels like a “boom goes the dynamite” moment, doesn’t it? And yet Trudeau is in the media today, saying people should “…believe the Privy Council Clerk.” Um, OK, let’s do that!

I think it’s obvious that Ms. Wilson-Raybould was pressured to avoid a trial with SNC-Lavalin. She knew that the decision was hers to make, so there was absolutely no need for the prime minister to tell her that. He clearly interfered in the judicial process.

Watched Manley on BNN Bloomberg. Under ordinary circumstances I might agree with him. But this is different due to those illegal and quite deliberate political donations to the LPC. Sure, they were repaid but that taints the party and government nonetheless.

“The optics aren’t good.” Eye roll. Manley is 100% correct. And What about the alternative? Scheer has no strategy for reconciliation which is why JWR must want something for herself out of #Lavacam. Don’t forget that Harper set the groundwork for DPA so he could (if re-elected get then sweetheart deal) and then removed the economic line item, which no one caught, facepalm

“X is obstructing justice”, partisan hackery that didn’t help Ignatieff either. Nor the democrats in the US hence no democrat candidate talks about impeachment

And sorry, Media exhoes from ‘merica Are easier to convey because we are already primed for collusion and obstruction of justice narratives. But those narratives are getting crushed by reality in the US by the looks the special council. Ancillary convictions are concelation prizes; Dershowitz can explain it better. Hence no democratic hopeful talks about the seriously, correctly focusing on ideas

Few care about SNC Lavalin…not relevant for Canadaland which isn’t being listened to.it’s only interesting for its educational benefit to insiders who are reminded what the Privy Council is….

If I was advising scheer he should be focusing on innovative solutions that are easy to understand “build the pipe”, not going down the Russia Collusion cul de sac. But if you’re a Liberal, yes, let him expend all his energy on this rather than pitching real solutions to real concerns.

Housevader,

Did you not learn anything from Sponsorship? Political perception, often accurate or exaggerated, IS ALWAYS the be-all, end-all. That’s what takes down governments, à la Martin, when the shit took place on the previous government’s watch.

Have you any idea how those illegal donations are being perceived in English-Canada? Not good. Some in Quebec are prepared to write them off — but is that really most people in this province? Again, perception is nine-tenths of the law and it absolutely kills politically. Cold fact-based reality is never a government saver under such circumstances.

.. shades o grey eh!
Ms Wilson-Reybould surely could build a list, plus include approx dates .. a list in descending order of urgency, the times she was ‘urged ‘ and any ‘attempts to press’ her or ‘press’ her or ‘put heavy pressure upon her’ & she can draw a red line and bisect the list with the legal ‘Its Time to Resign Red Time Line’.

Now she (Jody, If I may be so bold..) could also create a similar list regarding the Norman Criminal trial. Many of the sames are identical.. but different case, different stakes.. and add Scott Brison to the list – somewhere !

Now not to say ‘Jody’ cannot also add names of those who were 100 % decent and law abiding.. or held their preference or wishes in check. Or add those deserving special mention for being A holes etc..

Hell, ‘Jody’ could probably build a complete list for ecery file she was juggling ! ! Hoho ! A list of lists, so to speak! A specific frequency graph of appearances, and where they appeared above or below the RED LINE would be fascinating..

Yes yes.. back to the way before, back in the way back. When she took on the complexity of being an MP, then a Minister of the Legal and the Political.. and she commenced to interlock with the Director of Prosecution, The PMO, the Privy Council, the Gerald Butt’s level, the Prime Minister, the Mainstream Media, the hacks, the partisan pundits, the backstabbers, the gibbering haters, the sneering Opposition – Andrew Scheer, holier than thou’s Tony Clements, Pierre Poilievre or Denis Batters et al..

PS.. ms Wilson-Reybould might also add a brief criteria at the very end to explain if or how that helps guide her Red Pen.. when she draws the Red Line. My suspicion is – she has zero problem knowing where to draw the line..

When a subpoena is issued, who collects this information? RCMP? OPP? Does Butts and co. voluntarily submit this information? I have a feeling there might be some rapid deleting going on of it hasn’t happened already. Under a subpoena, does the police or defense have the ability to retrieve things that could be or have been deleted?

Des,

Normally, this becomes part of the discovery process before trial. The party that receives a subpoena can either voluntarily comply and enter the documents (or testimony) into the record, or fight it out in court. If so, the court can order a party to comply with the subpoena.

In this case, testimony has already been heard at a pretrial hearing.

It wasn’t just Trump and the right, it was a whole bunch of concerned citizens in the middle as well….and the problem was, those emails were deleted *after* being requested by the FBI (and then, of course, no one was ever held responsible).

This is the case that I have been keenly watching. There are issues in this prosecution that need to see the light of day, IMHO.

PMO shenanigans on this file too? I want to know more about this file and the handling of it.

Is Brison going to be subpoenaed too? His abrupt departure and the subsequent chaos is troubling, to say the least. This just leads to more questions about what is going on in the PMO.

When I see the Liberals or their advisers these days I am reminded of Big Daddy’s remarks from “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”:
“What’s that smell in this room? Didn’t you notice it, Brick? Didn’t you notice a powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room?… There ain’t nothin’ more powerful than the odor of mendacity… You can smell it. It smells like death.”

Trudeau is just like many other “elites” from the Laurentien clique. Spout off about how much you value our indigenous brothers and sisters in hopes of gaining their votes, but mercy me if you actually ask for something that will help the first arrivals of this land. Especially if involves things as important as golf courses, or engineering firms. Chretien was on the right track when he was a Minister; but too much push back.

Time for some drastic action.

Open the Constitution: Re-draft that part about English and French settling the country, and admit that it was the English, French, and many different indigenous folks who own the rights to this country. Apologies are only for the people looking for forgiveness.

If you don’t really mean what you say, you may as well settle for a tattoo.

Politico – Depending on the situation, it’s everything and nothing; we project onto our political opponents sentiments we imagine are there like sexism and racism (even using Indian) so that our political masters, in this case, the Tories get a 2% poll boost.

583,Warren Kinsella,Is Maxime Bernier a racist,2019-02-23 15:55:00,Warren,,"Is Maxime Bernier a racist?

It’s a fair question. For months, the leader of the nascent People’s Party of Canada has been giving us every indication that he just might be. So, let’s examine the available evidence, shall we?

On his Twitter feed, in interviews, in speeches, Bernier doesn’t often stray from red-meat conservative stuff. He’s for pipelines, he’s against supply management. He’s opposed to carbon taxes, he’s for tax cuts.

The usual. You could picture Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer saying a lot of the same things. In many respects, Bernier is Scheer, albeit with a better jawline and a superior fashion sense.

But it’s on race, generally – and immigrants and refugees and non-whites, specifically – that Max Bernier truly distinguishes himself. Over and over and over, Bernier’s words strongly suggest that, well, he just doesn’t like anyone who doesn’t look like him. It’s become a pattern, and the pattern has become impossible to ignore. It is unsettling.

At the outset, it should be said – and this writer has been saying it for thirty-plus years – that it is in no way racist to oppose increased levels of immigration, or accommodating more refugees. Those are legitimate topics for debate.

It is the way in which those subjects get debated, and described, that becomes problematic. And Max Bernier – because of the words he chooses, and those with whom he chooses to associate himself – is now indisputably piloting the same dark waters previously charted by the likes of Donald Trump and David Duke.

In fact, Maxime Bernier has separated himself, entirely, from the Canadian mainstream body politic. He isn’t shy about it: it’s his unique selling proposition.

• He calls diversity “nonsense” – and says he is the only politician who is “attacking” it. That’s certainly true.

• He says housing is costly in Vancouver and Toronto “because most immigrants move to these cities.”

• He declares that he is against “pandering to ethnic voting blocs” above a picture of a Chinese-Canadian woman.

• He told a Liberal MP, who happens to be black, that “you think the world revolves around your skin colour.”

• He regurgitates code words long favoured by the racist Right – ethnic “ghettoes,” “extreme multiculturalism,” “little tribes,” “cultural balkanization,” “the cult of diversity,” and so on.

• He says Canada should only let in people who accept “basic Western values” – which is nomenclature long deployed by the far Right to mean only white, European culture.

• He says there should be a “debate” about whether “there is too much immigration.” He thinks there is.

• He says that “extreme multiculturalism” promotes things like Pakistani independence – and Pakistani independence “led to one million deaths.”

A lot of his propagandizing is deliberately imprecise. And, it should be said, there is no known photo of Mad Max Bernier in a Klansman’s robes, cheerily setting a cross alight in a farmer’s field. He knows where the line is, and he is generally careful not to wander too far beyond it.

Until two weeks ago, that is.

Two weeks ago, B’nai Brith – a group that has advocated for human rights, and Canadian Jews, for more than a Century – issued a report on one of the folks who helps to lead Max Bernier’s feeding political party, and actually acts as its spokesman. His name is Martin Masse.

“Top Bernier Advisor Defends Nazi Sympathizers, Promotes Conspiracy Theories,” B’nai Brith headlined their report, and it was a doozy.

“An independent investigation by B’nai Brith Canada revealed that Masse has either made or supported a bevy of statements that may foment anti-Semitism, misogyny, and racism,” they wrote of Masse, who they described as “a long-time friend and advisor to [the People’s Party] leader, Maxime Bernier.”

Among B’nai Brith’s findings about Masse:
• He has called Zionism “just another fancy justification for killing and displacing Palestinians.”

• He defends neo-Nazis like convicted Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, and said that former French president Jacques Chirac “was controlled by notorious Jewish organizations.”

• He has published claims that LGBTQ groups simply want to establish “their own tyranny.”

• He has dismissed equality measures as laws favouring “femi-fascists.”

• He has said that Israel and the United States are to blame for terror attacks against them.

And what has Maxime Bernier called Martin Masse? Well, according to a CBC report about the creation of the People’s Party, Bernier regards Masse as his “top policy advisor,” a co-founder of his political party, and a close friend.

So, when he was asked by B’nai Brith to remove Martin Masse from his party, what did Maxime Bernier do?

He said no. He refused.

Is it necessary, at the end of all this, to label Maxime Bernier a racist? Do we really need to prove that he is a telegenic bigot who panders to the worst in people?

No. By his words, and by his deeds, we all know who Maxime Bernier is","<div class=""articlecontent"">

I dont know if he’s an actual racist, but he most certainly is an opportunist of the worst kind. In this case, I think his “brain trust” thinks xenophobia is a vote getter in certain parts among certain people.

Full disclosure, I personally bought into his Libertarian-Lite Kool Aide during the CPC leadership race and marked him my 1st choice on my ballot (Scheer 3rd)…. my bad.

Seeing his actions and behaviour since his loss, I’m of the mind now that the CPC is better off without him or his supporters from the fringe.

Is he a racist? I dunno, but I do figure on him being politically irrelevant after this Fall’s election.

I commented this a couple of Warren posts ago that I’m sure as shit glad that he’s not the leader. Yes, I personally had Scheer as 1 and I had Bernier as 4. The reason why I had him at 4 was because I knew he was popular but didn’t think he could lead based on simply an online following. When it came down to the final ballot I thought I would be happy with either choice. Then, in the following days after, my position was VALIDATED. Man, was I happy. Hell, I had Brad Trost ahead of him at 3. Lisa Raitt was #2. Lisa is an amazing parliamentarian. I’d have her as leader any day too.

We would be polling (and I don’t take as much heed in polling as others do) at like 20% with Max’s folks at HQ on Albert Street. They would be pushing all the wrong buttons (as they are on this obstruction of justice scandal) and running on an identity narrative. Sure, that’s a conservative position, but one to call out when it needs to be called out on. But, they would be so focused it that people like Michael Cooper who is a good interrogator wouldn’t be on the justice committee. Scheer has put together a team that fits. That issue is not to be focused on from a policy perspective. Sure, Scheer has a position of denying funding to universities that don’t endorse free speech. But, this is a position I totally support. Just look at the NDP base. They’re all 18-23 year old Bernie bros ie. university undergrads who believe anything their social science professors tell them.

Interesting. I am a traditional CON voter, but voted LIB last election as I felt Harper was becoming a dictator, and disliked some of the things he was doing (i.e. omnibus bills, CPP changes). I joined the CPC and voted for Maxime as first choice at the leadership convention, and Scheer as fourth. As we now know, if it wasn’t for the dairy cartel, Max would have won.
Since then I have join the PPC, and I am a board member of my local EDA. Why?
Maxime’s policies (no corporate bailouts, changing the equalization payment formula, using the constitution to force build a pipeline, etc) spoke to the way I think.
Scheer on the other hand, seems to be coming more like Trudeau every day. I don’t want a “Trudeau -lite ” PM. I want a PM with traditional CON values. I don’t want an PM who panders to every group out there in order to win a popularity contest (election). I want an PM who has conviction in his policies, even though not all will be fully accepted or appreciated.

Bernier does not have traditional Conservative or conservative values. The old Progressive Conservatives did things like fight apartheid. Even Harper’s Conservatives didn’t act on their worst instincts on diversity. Bernier by contrast is an underpowered intellectual wanna-be who has callously seized upon garbage ideas to try to generate headlines and still a portion of the Conservative base. He will fail because most Canadians aren’t racists.

I get leery any time someone brings up the racist card. It certainly sounds like Max’s buddy has some issues, but the label is thrown around so often you have to look twice, then look twice again. Look at some of the parties in Europe who are gaining support from folks who don’t like to see the Muslim grooming gangs abusing young girls. Their opponents are labelling them as racists. So apparently, wanting to protect girls from Rape gangs of Pakistani origin means you are a racist.
Look at Tommy Robinson of the UK. He’s been jailed on trumped up charges, castigated, physically attacked, and pilloried by the media. The public however, loves him and appreciate what he is doing. He is in no way a racist, but whenever his name comes up, it is always attached to labels like ‘|far right” or neo-nazi.

I think we need to save these terms for folks who deserve them. |Otherwise, a racist is just someone winning an argument against a liberal. |(as the saying goes|)

As an aside, I never really understood the reason for anti-semitism. There are white jews, Mediterranean jews, and even sammy davis junior jews…….anyone can belong to a religion.

I was always curious; but never surprised, when I spoke with folks and the people who seemed to hate stephen Harper the most were the same groups who seemed to hate Jews the most.

Very telling.

Interesting comments above. I was a CPC member who put Raitt first, Bernier second, and Scheer third.

To be honest, I wasn’t happy when Scheer won, mainly because of the pandering to the Eastern supply-management lobby. However, in hindsight, I realize what a myopic approach that was. Watching how Bernier has handled his new party is very telling, for the reasons you set out Warren.

I am now an active member of our local CPC riding association (EDA), and we just had our election-readiness meeting yesterday. Sure there was a lot of talk about Trudeau, but there was also talk about Bernier. We all agreed that we need to be very careful to distinguish ourselves from his party, and also not spend much time discussing “red meat” topics. We need to promote a positive set of alternative policies; not a divisive fear-mongering manifesto.

It is your moral duty as the husband of a Liberal Party member to compliment and support Bernier; here are some talking points from HQ:
– Try to see this from Bernier’s perspective; a mark of true intelligence.

– The hit job against Bernier’s associate has merit if you conflate Zionism with Judaism, and I’m sure words can be taken out of context. Or you want to police opinion in the Rest of Canada in English differently from French Quebec. But obviously it’s partially a hit job by the Tories via B’nai Brith designed to consolidate 300K Jewish Canadian votes against the PPC.

– Racism and cultural protection are on a spectrum. Anyone will tell you that the French language is protected in Quebec by prejudicing that dominant north American language (you know, the other one, not Spanish…) in everything from career progression to signage. Now to some that’s racism others that’s cultural protection/engineering. So Bernier tries to argue there should be no cultural groups, but instead there should be moderate assimilation (perhaps generationally imposed) which is consistent with Quebec nationalism i.e. cultural groups need to prejudice other groups in subtle ways to protect their own language or traditions via political power; otherwise face the consequences of assimilation: for Eastern European immigrants from the 1920s, that means only perogies their have survived. Your charge of racism is another person’s cultural protection.

– Assimilation and multiculturalism are on their own spectrum as well: the critique
against Multiculturalism is a Quebecois centric one, after all Paul Yusyk (Ukrainian Canadian Senator!) crafted Multiculturalism in response to the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission, to say, why can’t my Ukrainian community get language funding?

– Pierre Trudeau entrenched Multiculturalism in ’71 in an abstract form without true teeth behind it (like Father like Son) to diffuse Quebec nationalism…same with abstract agreement around First Nations in the ’90 – ’10. Never give away anything concrete though Obvious to you, I should hope.

– Then multiculturalism policy was used to grant Federal funding for cultural events, in what kinda looks like slush funds for a particular political party; which Bernier decried. He didn’t complain under Harper’s govt when the Tories copied the slush fund model to great effect since ‘immigrants are typically conservative’

– Too bad the Liberals own that vote, suckas! Game theory, chase the multicultural vote in ROC and do the opposite in Quebec.

On one hand you say “this writer has been saying it for thirty-plus years – that it is in no way racist to oppose increased levels of immigration, or accommodating more refugees. Those are legitimate topics for debate.”
But at the same time you put Max down by saying, “He says there should be a “debate” about whether “there is too much immigration.” He thinks there is.” Debating immigration is not a sign of being a racist.
Max supports immigration, but he thinks the Government is not able to properly support, and absorb into our cultural mosaic, the current number of immigrates. He proposes going from the current 350k, back down to the 250k of a few years ago. Let’s face it, privately sponsored immigrants aside, it is very costly to the government (i.e. taxpayers) to support immigrants. Charity begins at home first, and once we solve the outstanding problems here (health care, safe drinking water on reserves, etc) then we can increase immigration levels.

” Debating immigration is not a sign of being a racist.”

Until you try it, and they start screaming “RACIST!” at you…

‘Progressives’ are the most accepting and tolerant people out there (just ask them, they’ll tell you) until you express an opinion that differs from their own in any way.

As more of a Red Tory, my first choice was Michael Chong and although I knew he had no chance, I think that is the direction the party needs to move long term. Lisa Raitt was my second while my third was Erin O’Toole. I was originally planning to put Maxime Bernier third, but he fell to eighth and Scheer was seventh so my final ballot so counted towards Scheer. For Bernier I knew he was a bit of a loose cannon, but my concern was more libertarianism wouldn’t sell amongst the general public. Only when government gets way bigger than the optimal level can you run on dramatically reducing it and win and we aren’t at that point now. Thus I put him eighth more because I didn’t think he was electable.

After seeing what has transpired, I think the party really dodged a bullet. This guy would be a disaster and in many ways and is like Tim Hudak in Ontario who in an easily winneable election did horrible due to stupid policies only worse. I am not sure if Scheer is the right choice, but at least with him I think the party can hold what they have now and make some minor gains. Whether they can gain enough to win or not, is tough to say. In some ways Maxime Bernier seems to be more sour grapes and puts Scheer in a tough spot.

Scheer can move towards the centre to appeal to the Liberal/Tory swing voters, but then risks a split on the right with the more ideological elements going for Bernier’s PPC. Or Scheer can pander to the more right wing elements to keep the PPC in low single digits, but ensure the moderates stay with the Liberals and the Tories get stuck in the low 30s. And I think that is what Bernier wants, otherwise he is a sore loser and if he cannot be in charge he wants to ensure Scheer never becomes PM.

As for whether Bernier is a racist or not, I am not sure he feels passionate on those issues, but certainly he has no problem with people who are racists and that is a problem. Simply not being a racist yourself is not good enough, one needs to have no tolerance for those who are racist rather than see them as having legitimate opinions. One can still criticize our immigration levels without being racist. Personally I support more immigration overall, but I believe we should find a way to encourage more to move to smaller cities and rural areas while fewer to the bigger cities as the large metropolitan areas have too many people in general overall while our country as a whole has lots of space so we need a much bigger population but more evenly spread out.

So what you are saying is that we should shove the immigrants “out of sight, out of mind”? They want to come here because of the cities and the prosperity/safety we have to offer. Some people could label your statement above as racist. How does that make you feel?

I don’t necessarily see this as racist and not out of sight, just our population is overall unevenly distributed and we should find ways for both Canadians and non-Canadians to encourage more to settle in rural areas and smaller centres. Atlantic Canada has a real problem with lots of young people moving westward so trying to attract more people to come there could help reverse this decline. In fact many premiers in this region have asked for the provincial nominee to be increased so they can get more immigrants. As for big cities, I think high prices just in general will act as a deterrent to people moving there as lets face it for many people Vancouver and Toronto are not affordable.

Sure, and the Liberal Party hand-picked Karen Wang. There is a mutually reinforcing dynamic between European racialism and Asian and African racialism. All of it is wicked. Pound for pound, there is as much of it in the Liberal Party as anywhere else. After all, your party is working around the clock trying to subtly demonize Aboriginals to take the wind out of Wilson-Raybould’s sails.

Personality Cult indeed.

Again, I’m not of the opinion that Bernier is himself a racist. What is becoming increasingly clear though, is that his split from the Tories has resulted in a “Pied Piper” effect, luring away the marginalized fringes of the Conservative party.

It may result in some lost votes, but I’d figure the upside of being a safer, bigger tent, for centrists, Red Tories and Blue Liberals is the path to forming Government once again.

From today’s Globe. There is apparently no rule, no law, no principle that Justin Trudeau will not break to assist this sleazy multinational. None.


The Trudeau government is considering changes to ethical procurement rules that stipulate how long a company can be banned from bidding on federal contracts, a revision of policy that one expert says could offer Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin another means of coping with the fraud and corruption charges it faces.

SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering giant at the centre of the Wilson-Raybould affair, faces the charges stemming from an RCMP investigation into its business dealings in Libya. If convicted, it could be banned from bidding on federal contracts for 10 years.

Public Services and Procurement Canada is proposing granting itself more flexibility in deciding how long a company is banned from bidding when convicted.

SNC-Lavalin has been seeking a negotiated settlement in which a company admits wrongdoing and pays a fine, but avoids a trial. Last September, however, the federal director of public prosecutions rejected the request and informed the company the prosecution would continue.

Officials in the Prime Minister’s Office have denied putting inappropriate pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister and attorney-general on the case.

Joseph,

Got to disagree and go with what Derek says. The longer Trudeau pushes the envelope with SNC-L, the more seats the Liberals WILL lose in Ontario. That’s the main game.

The PMO is adrift, not only getting this wrong but also forgetting that in Sponsorship, guess which province got the most ticked off and voted accordingly? Hint: It wasn’t Ontario. So, even in Quebec, this could hurt more than most Quebecers realize but the lose power scenario is primarily based on Ontario seat losses.

I remain staunchly opposed to a DPA for SNC-L and I’m not alone in my circle.

I can see the new policy now……

The restriction in contracting with the Feds will now vary in length. The PMO’s new policy direction will be easily understood; particularly in Quebec.

Here is the gist of the new rule.

“The more money you direct to the Liberal Party, its affiliates, or its other members in good standing; the lesser the time restrictions will last.

Go from ten years, to a few months….all depends upon the number of zeros’ you have on the cheque.

Reporters are often asked, off the record of course, to present a case for the politicos who feed them. No need for research, no fact checking required, just copy and paste journalism.

So, thank you Mr. Kinsella for providing a “legal review” of the case, as contrasted with the spin regurgitated by the journalist.

.. True enough.. and aint it ironic that the law and such cases are likely the principal deciding factors for a Prosecuter ! And the likelihood of a conviction of course.

We in the salamander horde maintain the Lavalin imbroglio may, without any ironclad testimony or evidence, written, recorded, contemporaneous notes, email, docs.. pertinent of course .. become a ‘she said – they said’ political and legal standoff.

We maintain that Ms Wilson-Reubould could and should create a chronology with names and dates, with whom she met, discussed, conversed, was lobbied, was ‘urged’ by, or there were ‘attempts to press her’ or ‘was pressed’ or experienced ‘heavy pressure upon her’.. (note – in italics are courtesy of Globe and Mail 2nd or 3rd hand hearsay evidence evolved & published per ”anonymous political insider’ sources – To describe as ‘hearsay’ perhaps Warren could opine how a judge might rule re such as ‘evidence’)

She could then bisect said list or chronology with two lines. A RED line to represent the legal cutoff date or stage where there could be no overrule of the Director of Prosecution, Ms Roussel.

A 2nd BLUE line (the offside line) she could use under any meeting she felt was either after the cutoff, or simply asking her to flout law, or attempt obstruction. That’s a big thick line by the way.. It too gets right to Warren’s point of law. Does it indicate collusion on the part of the Attorney General ? No. Far from it. It may be the hinge this nonsense swings on though. Would it represent ‘Obstruction’ ? Bet the farm on it..

Simultaneously, the Norman Criminal Case – remarkably similar re all the same names and roles etc.. ran head on into one Ms Marie Henein.. and a judge who immediately spoke aloud in an open court, supporting her claim and evidence (zero hearsay) of delay, avoidance, relectance or oh no say it aint so – Obstruction or Collusion by Government and Prosecution to prevent Discovery Evidence being in the hands of Mr Norman’s Defense.

What a 2nd can of worms..

How many people in the Trudeau government had a similar or even more forceful conversation with Wilson-Raybould about SNC-Lavalin? After the DPP had made her decision?

I remember Duffy-gate like it was yesterday…….

Fat dude expenses things that are really outside of the pale; though all completely legal. The Prime Minister of the Day thinks it stinks, and demands that it get paid back to the taxpayer.
Fat dude can’t….he bought a bunch of Krispee Kremes and hasn’t got a nickle to his name (so he says).
Prime Minister at the time has a friend and staffer who is a billionaire. The amount is peanuts; pocket change to him, so he cuts a cheque to keep the Boss from knowing his orders weren’t obeyed.
Press was on it non-stop for several years………

Conservative Scandal – Conservative Prime Minister demands that taxpayers not be taken advantage of. Rich dude pays the difference from his own pocket…and turns out, the fat dude didn’t do anything (legally) wrong.

Why do Conservative Scandals involve conservatives paying out of pocket, whereas LiBeral scandals always involve corruption, graft, back-scratching and bag men?

Hey…at least our PM has nice hair and good teeth. that has to count for something.

Is it? I don’t see why. I had zero expectations for Bernier in Outremont. York-Simcoe, maybe some disappointment on his part. But Burnaby-South genuinely surprises me – that Bernier was seemingly able to carve off a third of what I assume is the Conservative vote. I don’t know the riding well, but I thought Bernier would get stomped there. I find that outcome troubling.





Ronald O'Dowd says:

Ian,

I don’t think it’s wrong to argue that a relatively strong PP can only cost the CPC seats. Protest votes in significant numbers are always dangerous for the official opposition.

I don’t expect Bernier to get there but it’s theoretically possible.






Matt says: 

February 26, 2019 at 11:21 am

1) Bernier didn’t get 10%. A VERY well known local candidate got 10%.

2) In the other 2 ridings where the PPC were running essentially on Bernier’s name recognition the PPC got 1.9% (York-Simcoe) and 2.1% (Outremont)

Reply


Matt says: 

February 26, 2019 at 11:24 am

Plus, we’ll see in a general if it will still be 10%. By-elections usually have less then half (sometime less than a third) of the voter turnout a general election does.

574,Warren Kinsella,"LavScam poll: Trudeau’s Liberals are losing, change is winning",2019-02-26 08:17:00,Warren,,"Angus Reid Group has a sounding of public opinion to share, this morning – and for the #LavScam Liberals, it’s bad.

A visual representation of the horserace numbers:


I spoke to another pollster yesterday. I asked him if Trudeau was being hurt by #LavScam. His response? “Buddy, Trudeau is going to lose the election. As things stand now, he’s going to lose to Scheer, maybe badly.” Angus Reid’s #LavScam poll certainly confirms that, and more.

Meanwhile, last night’s by-elections, as predicted, gave each of the three main parties something to cheer about, but they don’t mean much. Trudeau’s party held Outremont for a Century, and – with Tom Mulcair gone – Trudeau was always going to get it back. Singh had been winning Burnaby South for weeks – because the Grits never recovered after their first candidate made some race-related comments online. And Andrew Scheer could’ve had a lengthy nap and still held York-Simcoe.

Oh, and the Maxime Bernier juggernaut? He came distant fourth in Burnaby South, a distant fifth in York-Simcoe, and a distant sixth in Outremont. He, and his party, are a joke. A joke.

Not as funny, however, are Trudeau’s prospects. #LavScam is killing him. Last night’s move to stop the bleeding – finally letting Jody Wilson-Raybould testify before the Justice Committee, with conditions – is a clear indication that Trudeau knew that he had to do something. The scandal just wasn’t going away.

He’s clearly decided to take whatever hit he needs to take, now, in the hope that voters will forget the scandal in an election that is slightly more than 200 days away.

It’s a big, big gamble. Will it work? Maybe. A week is a lifetime in politics, etc.

But the other pollster I spoke to told me Justin Trudeau had been losing before #LavScam hit.

<p>Meanwhile, last night’s by-elections, <a href=""http://warrenkinsella.com/2019/02/youre-welcome/"">as predicted</a>, gave each of the three main parties something to cheer about, but they don’t mean much. &nbsp;Trudeau’s party held Outremont for a Century, and – with Tom Mulcair gone – Trudeau was always going to get it back. &nbsp;Singh had been winning Burnaby South for weeks – because the Grits never recovered after their first candidate made some race-related comments online. &nbsp;And Andrew Scheer could’ve had a lengthy nap and still held York-Simcoe.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Maxime Bernier juggernaut? &nbsp;He came distant <em>fourth</em> in Burnaby South, a distant <em>fifth</em> in York-Simcoe, and a distant <em>sixth</em> in Outremont. &nbsp;He, and his party, are a joke. &nbsp;<em>A joke.</em></p>
<p>Not as funny, however, are Trudeau’s prospects. &nbsp;#LavScam is killing him. &nbsp;Last night’s move to stop the bleeding – finally letting Jody Wilson-Raybould testify before the Justice Committee, with conditions – is a clear indication that Trudeau knew that he had to do <em>something</em>. &nbsp;The scandal just wasn’t going away.</p>
<p>He’s clearly decided to take whatever hit he needs to take, now, in the hope that voters will forget the scandal in an election that is slightly more than 200 days away.</p>
<p>It’s a big, big gamble. Will it work? &nbsp;Maybe. A week is a lifetime in politics, etc.</p>
<p>But the other pollster I spoke to told me Justin Trudeau had been losing before #LavScam hit.</p>
<p>A desire for change, he said, is once again in the air.</p>

Or maybe he’s been advised that there’s no way to keep JWR from speaking on these matters, because privilege either doesn’t apply, or because he already waived it by speaking about them himself.

In which case it looks slightly less terrible if he pretends to have nothing to fear and makes a big show of “waiving” privilege that doesn’t exist, and then reacting with faux shock if her testimony implicates him and/or members of his office.

First off, Trudeau is a seasoned fighter that knows when & how to bob & weave when boxing, or sparing. Second, Bo-Blandy may have an upper hand but the good people of CANADA know what a third term Conservative government would bring to the existing social net that is already starting to look like it is torn across the board CANADA, and the USA.

Conservative rule in CANADA is anathema to all in CANADA except the federal cohort of politicians that are invested in that camp.

Trudeau will get a second term after he KOs Bo-Blandy on Conservative policy deficits across CANADA and the social network divide.

The moneyed classes are disproportionately represented politically in Parliament. The indentured servant class currently immersed in abject poverty is not going to tolerate the fiscal largesse of the immorally positioned in the Conservative Party of CANADA.

Prime Minister Trudeau should not be discounted so easily IMO.

People don’t vote parties in they vote parties out. So the best thing the Tories can do is keep quiet and have a safe non-controversial platform. Now if they make some stupid promise like Hudak did in 2014, when he promised to fire 100,000 civil servants, they can easily change the channel and make the ballot question about keeping the Tories out not dumping Trudeau. In this day and age, things are so cynical people vote for what they think is the lesser of evils, not what they want.

Perhaps.
The question is more rhetorical.
Specifically, why would they want to be able to award a federal contract to SNC prior to the election.
Following that, if they wouldn’t be able to give out a major contract to SNC who could they give a significant contract to in the Montreal area prior to the writ being dropped?
The clock is ticking, and if they don’t do it soon they won’t have anything to do the team photo prior to the election to show the voters there the benefits of voting liberal.

.. interesting ‘insider’ suppositions Mr Kinsella !

A few stray thoughts though from the salamander horde. We already sent a mischievous series of tweets to The Institute.. uh the Angus Reid Institute.. of Higher Polling and Prognostification for the Nation. Our complaint was/is – nowhere in their newsy tweet or via their Institute website, was the context, framing and question(s) regarding their ‘data’ nor was information regarding who or whom they polled. (neither have you, so our supposition is you’re OK with that.. plus you have other ‘anonymous pollsters’ giving you insider tips.. re an election a ways off.. non ?)

Further, just as you point out, Bernier & his chosen candidates were humiliated.. but wait ! Bernier on the verge of winning the 13th CPC ‘lardership’ ballot but was beaten last gas of tone deaf musical chairs by a girning n grinnin nothingburger named Scheer as a last ditch evangelical middle class multi millionaire alternative to scary Bernier who seemingly won the first 12 ballots

But now in the here n now n mebbe know.. Canadians may be treated to a ‘she said, they said’, pissing contest (Mainstreet Media lick their chops.. they can’t lose.. no matter & will pump the airwaves to a frenzied froth)

The ‘upside of down’ ? We all get a headslap education.. on conclusion jumping, flawed logic, partisan decibel levels.. or learn Trudeau appointed some scumbags.. or is one himself.. or both. Any fool could see Admiral Scheer floundering in one foot of water in similar circumstance.. where Harper would have just lied, denied, circled the wagons and held us citizens ‘of modest human capital’ (Jason Kenney famous quotes) in complete contempt and disdain with backup from the ‘2nd most powerful politician in Canada’ – Ray Novak and the short pants PMO club & the lost in space sellout wankers of the Royal Harper Privy Council

For all this excitement about Trudeau’s imminent defeat he fared reasonably well in the byelections last night, gaining Outremont and a manageable vote share decline against the NDP leader and in York Simcoe.

Bernier and the PPC did indeed bomb(Burnaby was a minor exception) but Scheer and the CPC went utterly nowhere, marginally up in York-Simcoe and DOWN in 2 of the 3 ridings? If the Liberals have never been weaker where was the stampede to vote CPC?

Singh will certainly be the NDP leader now which is a good thing for the LPC, the NDP may have bottomed out now, but I can’t imagine them doing anything more than saving some incumbents at this point.

It appears the public had a giant yawn last night and didn’t even turn up. It’s not great news for the Liberals but they can certainly hand on to power.

Except that if you look at the national poll excerpted above, the Liberals are trailing the CPC notwithstanding that the NDP has bottomed out. In other words, nowhere to go but up for the NDP and any growth comes at the expense of the Liberals. If the Liberals are trailing while the NDP is still in ‘save-the-furniture’ territory, that’s pretty bad news for the Liberals isn’t it?

Reply


Douglas Musk says: 

February 26, 2019 at 6:21 pm

My point is that the poll is nothing at all like the byelection results. We have REAL data in those three contests and they don’t show the CPC up appreciably like this Angus Reid poll has it. It’s possible there is a “regional” factor at play here, but all three contests were in different provinces and in different types of ridings and the CPC vote share was static.

These results correlate much more with the polls that put the horse race as very close, with a one or two point margin either way. Which is good for the Liberals since they have a more efficient vote.

Where are the CPC votes going to come from Gord? With these kinds of results maybe Bernier goes away and the CPC gets a boost from that, but it’s obvious the “pragmatic centrist” stuff from Scheer isn’t moving a ton of Liberals into his camp. He has a real problem as well, and the Liberals can always stay in power in a minority with Singh’s backing, the CPC needs a majority or bust.

You’re right – we should only look at by-elections as those are a clear barometer of national trends.

1. I’m gonna assume that the independent 5% is mostly the ppc. Add that to the cpc and they would win a huge majority. Sadly ppc voters are irrational like never trump Republicans.

2. The NDP are going nowhere with the lazy SOS they have as leader. An airhead is under that turban. That’s unfortunate because I think the blue collar left are being left out in the cold.

3. If the G&M report is true that the pmo is trying to change the contracting/construction rules to save SNC-Lavalin then Canada outside QC is going to go ballistic and the LPC will be annihilated in the ROC. (And it will put scheer to the test).

If true it is prima facie evidence that the LPC is OWNED by the corrupt elements of Quebec Inc.

No longer will Canadians have wonder if the LPC is the vassal political arm of the laurentian Elite – they will have a smoking gun with the LPCs fingerprints all over it.

I’m starting to think Trudeau and co. are going all-in on Quebec with the way they’ve handled LavScam, hoping to replicate Dad’s election win in 1980 where the Grits won all but one Quebec seat and just enough seats in urban Ontario and Atlantic Canada for a majority.

Assuming this is the strategy (i.e. assuming they have one), it’s a mighty big gamble. First, the Liberals were going to clean up in Quebec anyways (the PPC will probably split the CPC vote just enough, the NDP is DOA and the Bloc still can’t get their act together). Second, the naked pandering to Quebec and whiff of corruption are likely to turn off swing voters in places like BC and Ontario.

Again, I might be giving them too much credit to assume this is part of a coherent strategy rather than fumbling…

Vancouverois says:

The demographics have also changed considerably. Remember, the 2011 election was notable because it was the first time a party was able to win a majority even with only minimal representation in Quebec (5 seats out of 78).

Even if the Liberals win every single seat in the province (a dubious proposition), they still need to get another 91 everywhere else. And more and more of those seats must come from Ontario and the West.

It’s not a desire for change, actually, the last election was. This is more of a “damn, we backed the horse with a dancing dressup clown for a jockey, now what!?”
I remember the fancy words and the “I will be a transformational Prime Minister” speech, and yet, finals are just about upon us and they are cramming to get as much of their first batch of homework done, when we should be seeing results that we were led to believe in, and looking towards the next assignments. It looks like a second term is needed to correct and achieve the goals of the first. Damn, I wish I could vote for AOC.

Anyone can cherry pick polls if they wish – If I have to choose between Anguis Reid and Nanos, I’m going with Nanos.

This ‘scandal’ is quickly turning into a nothing burger.

Two points: 

1. Your ‘boss’ i.e. the Prime Minister has a right and authority to question and ask you to consider all options.

2. Hard to claim you were ‘demoted’ from a cabinet seat to another cabinet seat.

Miles Lunn says:

Nanos is a four week rolling average which includes 2 weeks before the scandal so lets see what it says in another two weeks. I agree it may mean nothing, I’ve seen governments survive other scandals, but a lot will depend on whether is it still front page news by September or forgotten about. Also right now no one is looking at the Tories closely, so a lot will depend on their platform. If their platform is a non-threatening one, they could win, but put any crazy right wing ideas in it and they will sink fast. I remember in January 2014 Forum showing similar numbers in Ontario with PCs around 38% and Liberals around 31% and we know what happened that June. To be fair I think Scheer is more like Harper, while Bernier is more your federal version of Hudak.

Re #1, if Trudeau and the PMO had believed that that was all there was to it, and that it applied to the AG as well as any ordinary cabinet minister, we would have had a clear, comprehensive, non-deflecting explanation from them from the very beginning. As it is, we had anything but, and it’s hard to think what more the PM could have done to make it look like he was hiding something. Not to mention Butts resigning for no obvious reason – at the time of his resignation there had been no fingers explicitly pointing at him, making it hard to square with his explanation of not wanting to be a distraction.

Re #2,
a) that’s only true if one truly believes that every cabinet seat is equal in importance, prestige, etc as every other. You may believe that, but I think that clearly some ministries are more important than others.
b) if you prefer “side-moved” to “demoted” it changes not an iota of the narrative. An apparently non-pliable AG was moved out of justice to make way for a MP from the same province as SNC-L in the apparent hope that the new AG would do what the former AG wouldn’t.

If I were in the Liberal campaign, I’d be very nervous about the fact that whether you look at Angus Reid (7 points back) or Nanos (statistical tie), in all polls the NDP is languishing in the mid-teens. That’s about what Jack Layton scored in his first outing in 2004 (netting them a paltry 19 seats but enough to deny Martin a majority). And that was after the Liberal scare-machine went into overdrive and squeezed the Dipper vote to prevent a Tory win (the infamous last-weekend swing that only Nanos picked up).

What this says to me is that there’s not much NDP vote left to squeeze, and the Liberals are bleeding centrist and Blue Liberals to the Tories. If the NDP finally manages to get some traction with its leader in the House, any uptick in the numbers is probably going to come at the expense of the Grits. If Trudeau can’t win back those centrist swing voters, it’s game over.

Traditional method to regain those votes in Quebec is to demonstrate the benefits by awarding a major contract in say Montreal.

He’ll pledge tens of millions of dollars to some obscure social justice cause over Twitter because some American celebrity asked him too. The Liberals will lead the polls and Canada will still be Canada.

So if she can only talk about things while she was the AG and not afterward, can’t she still talk about why she resigned from cabinet? I can most certainly assume why, however, I don’t see why she can’t do that. Wouldn’t resigning from cabinet be a personal decision which, despite having to do with this specific case, is a free and voluntary decision made on her part. Wouldn’t she be allowed to at least discuss that?

It’s unfortunate for our democracy that the Liberals are allowing an unbalanced report of what occurred in their “contribution” to the SNC-Lavalin events. Democracies don’t silence any portion of their population – and to so obviously gag a member of cabinet demonstrates a belief that our Prime Minister can interpret Canadian law to suit himself for the purpose of preserving his supporters. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak freely, as all Canadians have the right to do. If Trudeau chooses to attempt to limit her ability to speak, I believe she doesn’t have to be as respectful as she has chosen to be and can speak on her own as a Canadian citizen. And as a Canadian citizen, I can then choose to listen to all sides and thus have the ability to make up my own mind and vote accordingly in the next election.

One person has information to criminally indict the govt but doesn’t want to share it for fear of being disbarred. That’s a small price to pay for saving the country. She will get work someplace else. Why hang on to a law career when justice is being compromised? Seems like misplaced ideals.

You are relying on Trudeau and his band of neophytes to do the right thing? That’s not going to happen. When Oct rolls around and the Liberals have obfuscated this all, shored up Quebec votes and stand to take a majority again, we will look back and wonder if one lawyers career was worth it the destruction of the country. Alberta wont stand for another Liberal term. So choose your poison.

I’ve been repeatedly told that they remain proud Canadians.





Chris says: 

February 27, 2019 at 8:26 pm

We in Alberta are not so proud these days as the Butts/Trudeau portion of the Liberal government is doing everything it can to destroy Alberta’s economy (either intentionally or accidentally). We in Alberta are assuming 90% of Canada’s efforts to reduce Carbon Emmissions, even though our energy industry is only responsible for about 20% of Canada’s total emmissions. We are losing homes and retirement savings and jobs. Other Canadians are paying a couple cents per litre at the pump (Ontario hydro customers assume the remaining 10%).





Sam White says: 

February 28, 2019 at 9:57 am

I love it when guys like Derek make comments like this. It’s almost as good as eastern politicians opining that Albertans should stick to simple things like municipal politics, a “bunch of farmers” should not be in charge of the richest resource in the nation and my personal favourite: “Canada isn’t doing well right now because it’s Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda. It doesn’t work.”

Keep it up..

Agreed. If this story wasn’t reported by the media, JWR would still be in cabinet and the public would be completely unaware of the alleged crime.

I am hoping and praying that she states that legal counsel has advised her that she may address any of the statements given by her client (PMJT and his court) as they have surrendered client privilege by speaking. I doubt it, but it would be nice.

The alternative, is for her to state over and over again that the she would like to discuss details of conversation such-n-such, regarding SNC, but cannot. That will send the PMO and the media into respective frenzies.

two observations: the NDP and Conservatives preface comments with “We Believe You”. The Liberal inquisitors adopt a skeptical, accusatory prosecutorial tone and do not express that they “Believe You”. And, despite having access to Jody’s written remarks and taking notes as she speaks, somehow “misinterpret” and try to put words in Jody’s mouth, to which she easily swats aside with “That’s NOT what I said….”. And true to her character, JWR refuses to be lead down the path of DPAs and ‘job losses’. Her father is a proud man today. As is all of Canada who witnessed this. Anyone know a school in need of a drama teacher? (no disrespect to drama teachers).

Sorry to post again Warren, but if JT says he didn’t think it was undue pressure and that the decision was hers alone, then why did he remove her from the ministry?

That means clearly she was removed because he/they wanted her to come to a different decision. Which means her options were: make the “right” decision or you are fired. If that’s not an unethical perhaps illegal level of pressure I don’t know what is.

Karl-Milton Marx-Friedman says:

Let’s face it, JWR did a great job of cataloging undue pressure. Let’s all face it that no law was broken, she didn’t resign at the time…only after she was demoted. Case closed. So the PM was trying to protect good jobs which are a rare commodity in Canada. Quebec seats +25 LPC. Quebec narrative is rock solid. Red Wave. Now for the ROC…

Rebuttal to Tories: Lavalin can survive but Scheer is against protecting Canadian industry so “he would likely put pressure on the AG prosecute SNC and no one would care because putting pressure is politics 101.” Another line of attack is that Scheer thinks Diefenbaker was right to shut down funding for the Avro Arrow. Calling for the PM to resign is just sooooo insider baseball. Point of order, Andy is clueless. Anyway, Andrew Scheer can’t lay pipe anyway.

Rebuttal to NDP: Economic nationalism is Liberal policy; protecting Canadian jobs is the rebuttal to Jagmeet Singh, on the incorrect claim that the Liberals are helping rich friends: “9,000 employees are rich with intellectual property which we risk losing”. Another line of attack is to hand Singh a undergrad economics text book and offer him a cabinet position if he can pass a mid-term. There are great aspects of socialism, economic reality is not one of those areas. Recall that NDP are supposed to be economic nationalists, unifor, so I guess he doesn’t know Tommy D.

So you’re saying it’s fine to jimmy the law, and to subvert the Director of Public Prosecutions? A bit of give and take, a nudge, nudge here and there to protect the guilty, what ho? All this pressure, if JWR had bent to it, would have meant as AG she’d have to direct the federal prosecutors to change their course on SNC Lavalin, which by law means such direction would have to be publicly published/gazetted. Then what? Would that have all blown over? Unlikely.

You need to examine your own personal ethics before fulminating. And learn about the procedures an AG has to go through if the prosecution service has its recommendations overruled by that office.

But what should I expect on the Internet? Intelligence? The Conservatives are all loving it, but then “What Me Worry?” Scheer has posed with racists, more than once, he’s so devoid of street smarts. I imagine if the Cons were in power, they’d find a way to gerrymander the process depite all the fake horror they presently evince. Don’t trust that lot an inch, not after harper.

Can’t trust the Liberals, can’t trust the harper retreads running the Conservatives – doesn’t leave much for this country to look forward to, does it? The place is being run for big business, and no one else matters. If anyone gets in the way, it’s off with their heads one way or the other. SNC isn’t going to relocate to Brexit London unless they’re crazy, they’re going to have to suck it up and start running their business honestly and ethically. That’s the way they help their employees in the long run.

An observation from a former journalist…

I was surprised to see JT address the scandal tonight, but after watching it I realized why.

He was in Montreal to privately meet with the winner of the by-election. I’m assuming there was no media availability planned, and all of the national media stuck around in Ottawa anyhow to watch the Jody show. This opened up an opportunity for JT.

The journos JT picked to ask questions in his media availability weren’t all stars. In fact, I would guess they were local Montreal scribes sent by their assignment editors on short notice… thus the fairly softball questions and unacceptable lack of follow ups (JT left himself open at least twice to serious damage had the journos aggressively followed up on his lack of clarity).

Frankly, a great call by JT’s staff. Had he dodged and not commented today, there would be ENORMOUS pressure to do so tomorrow… in front of the entire national press gallery. IE: they’d smell blood and rip him apart.

He dodged the bullet today, but his moment is coming.

I had a feeling that Jody Wilson-Rayboulds testimony would be bad. I just did not expect it to be as explosive and devastatingly detailed as it was. The honesty, courage and strength of this proud woman is extremely admirable. I watched her entire testimony and it was clear to me she was telling the truth. To see Trudeau come out afterwards with an arrogant attitude and basically double down on calling his former AG a liar left me with a sick feeling. I hope the Liberals band together and talk some sense into Trudeau. Pursuing what appears to be his continued strategy of smear & denial is going to make things worse for himself, and his party.

Seems JT is considering barring her from caucus and being a Liberal candidate in the election. That move would seem terribly inadvisable to me. Take this apparently hyper-competent, ethical, smart person and turf her because of her backbone and the political inconvenience of her ethics? Good lord. Go ahead, ban her. Make a martyr out of her. I’d probably vote for whichever party she joined thereafter.

What is next in all this is very interesting, to say the least. What becomes of the Liberal caucus? How will their loyalties divide? Will there be an exodus of pro-JWR members? If so, where is their new political home? What about the Liberal party membership? Can they trigger a leadership review or something?

Next election will be something else — left and right both split, both unappealing, not any better in the centre. I seriously see nothing other than Greens as an option I could stomach (ignoring local candidate considerations, which are important to me).

Does it help him in Quebec, though? That remains to be seen. Remember the Sponsorship scandal – even though Quebec got all that money, it didn’t play well.

Today a lot of Quebec commentators are acknowledging that whatever they may think of JWR’s decision not to intervene to spare SNC-Lavalin, it was unquestionably interference for Trudeau to keep pressuring her after the decision was made.

Quebeckers are individual people, not all the greedy criminal monsters some would make them out to be. And like most people, most of them do have a sense of right and wrong.

Justin’s attempt to lie his way out of this won’t work. Much of what JWR said is backed by Justin’s comments, the comments from members of the PMO, as well as credible reports from the Globe and Mail. His attempts to manipulate opinion by rationalizing his conduct,
as the protector of jobs, indirectly support JWR.

While it is possible to disagree on opinion, one cannot disagree on fact. I’m sure Warren would concur with the notion that “a fact is a fact… and when a fact is a fact its factual. And that’s a fact!” (A spin on the ol’ ‘a proof is a proof and proven’ and it is applicable here!) JWR has laid out facts. Let’s have some from the other side. We’re past parsing and dissecting “feelings” and “characterizations”. As for the diversion of “6000 job losses”, the work will get done. Jobs will be given to ethical contractors who will now bid in tenders and have a level playing field. Canada will survive should SNC Lavalin move to London. Oh, one last thing, to the Liberal bottom-feeders on the Justice Committee who sneered and snidely asked Jody why she didn’t resign – she “didn’t cut and run”. She’s got more honour and integrity in her fart than you have in every fiber of your being. History will show you were on the wrong side.

His ego is huge, in my 62 years on this planet I don’t think I’ve seen many bigger than his.

Resigning in disgrace is not in his DNA, I think he truly believes he’s entitled to lead this country, period. Whether it’s by virtue of his last name, sycophantic friends & followers reinforcing this etc. I have no idea. I have no wish to delve any further into his mindset.

Of the five types of narcissists, the know it all, grandiose, seductive, bullying & vindictive, he seems to fit them all. I’m not sure which slot he fits best, but he IS a narcissist, there is zero doubt about that.

This government should fall...Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony Wednesday was so utterly damning that the Liberals no longer have a moral mandate to govern.“
Elizabeth Renzetti, Globe and Mail: “That Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s boss and his inner circle lacked the respect to listen to her “no” says volumes about the way that circle works. Or, if you prefer, for whom that circle works...Ms. Wilson-Raybould came out to quietly and methodically speak her truth, and exposed a structure that increasingly looks sleazy at its core.“
John Ibbitson, Globe and Mail: “…the Prime Minister and his most senior advisers gravely undermined the rule of law when they repeatedly urged her as attorney-general to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for partisan political reasons. To have then threatened her when she refused, and to have removed her from her portfolio when she would not bow to those threats, was reprehensible.”
Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail: “That is clearly not the open and accountable government Mr. Trudeau promised. That’s trying to arrange the Prime Minister’s outcome behind closed doors, but keeping the accountability away.”
Editorial board, Globe and Mail: “It is hard to exaggerate the seriousness of this. Her allegations go to the foundations of the Canadian justice system’s independence, and they rise to the highest levels of the government. They are all the more powerful because this accusation against the Trudeau government is being made by one of its most senior members.“
Chantal Hébert, Toronto Star: “The Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party’s neck...Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess. On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.”
Susan Delacourt, Toronto Star: “It is going to be impossible to look at Justin Trudeau’s government the same way again. Wilson-Raybould has presented that opposite image: a prime minister who made life very difficult for an Indigenous woman in his government, who was more than ready to embrace the hard cynicism of power. That image just doesn’t line up with the one Trudeau, or even his critics, have presented of this government so far. But it’s now a signature picture in the political history books.”
Editorial board, Toronto Star: “The former minister was a highly credible witness; her story will have to be countered with facts, not slogans, and certainly not with any attempt to discredit Wilson-Raybould. That was tried after the story first broke, and backfired badly…This isn’t going to be settled with a campaign-style battle of slogans that avoids the core issue raised by Wilson-Raybould: an attempt to inject nakedly partisan considerations into what should be an arms-length judicial decision.”
John Ivison, National Post: “Trudeau appointed as justice minister someone who said she is a “truth-teller,” an Indigenous person who said she has witnessed the consequences of the rule of law not being respected. He appointed her and then he tried to make her complicit in running roughshod over that law.”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “It was clear from the first line of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony: the Trudeau government is now officially in crisis, the jobs of several of its top officials hanging by a thread. What is revealed throughout is an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.”
John Ivison, National Post: “When she still failed to bend to his will, he removed her from her position as justice minister. If he thought she would respond to the “veiled threats” levelled against her, he clearly misread this woman.”
Christie Blatchford, National Post: “It sounded and felt like a death knell for the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau…”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “It is nothing short of remarkable that, amid what she called this “barrage” of improper pressure, Wilson-Raybould stood her ground. Why didn’t she resign? Thank goodness she didn’t. She appears to have been one of the few people in this government with any principled belief in the rule of law. And in the end she did pay for it with her job, not once but twice.”
Christie Blatchford, National Post: ”
As Jody Wilson-Raybould, the deposed federal justice minister and attorney-general, read aloud her opening statement at the justice committee Wednesday, with breathtaking clarity and intelligence, the room (and likely living rooms across the country) was still. Her revelations were so shocking that it left the government of “sunny ways” under a black cloud and Canada looking like a corrupt Third World banana republic. The stink so envelops the Prime Minister himself, many of his staffers, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff, and the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, that if they had a shred of integrity, which is very much in doubt, some if not all of them would resign.”
Editorial board, Toronto Sun: “This is not just sloppy messaging. This is not just a sign that the Liberals are too cozy with SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau’s press conference yesterday was horrible. I remember Martin’s radio address back in 2005 after the explosive Jean Brault testimony at the Gomery inquiry and his seemed much better as at least Martin didn’t try to justify what happened although to be fair it was the Liberal party not him personally connected. Yes jobs matter, but so do ethics and basically Trudeau came across that certain companies are too big to fail so due to potential job losses we will hold them to a different standard. People like leaders who show humility, not ones that show arrogance. A great example of how to deal with something like this is Gordon Campbell’s DUI in Hawaii in 2003. He actually broke the law and in many ways that was worse than what Trudeau did, but when he owned up and apologized and didn’t try to make excuses his approval numbers went up and in fact in the 2005 election, the DUI was never brought up.

Trudeau should have just taken the bulls by the horn and said it was a lapse of judgement here and that he didn’t understand the seriousness of this, but now realizes it and that he is sorry and takes full responsibility and will not let this happen again. Yes he would take a temporary hit in the polls, but most realize politicians are human and like all of us make mistakes we sometimes regret. Instead he came across that he is only sorry he got caught, not sorry what he did and the fact he tries to make excuses or deflect it just makes it worse. Taking full responsibility and a full apology would at least allow him to recover while digging in will just make it worse.

You’re right, but most politicians don’t think that way. I think it comes from being so inside their respective partisan bubbles. Just think of Bill Clinton, for example, during Lewinskygate. He could have simply admitted what he did and apologized. But instead we got months and months of Ken Starr gong show idiocy and Bubba dancing on a rhetorical head of a pin, etc.

I agree. As many people have said ad nauseam, it’s not the crime, it’s the coverup.

That said, the difference between Campbell and Trudeau is that Campbell’s DUI was seen as a single instance of an error in judgment, involving something that many people now regard as a health issue rather than a personal or moral failing. I don’t think people thought it reflected on his honesty, integrity or ability. Not so Trudeau, whose conduct has cast doubt on all three of those things.

This is most definitely a case of a Prime Minister who has lost his moral and ethical compass in everything decent. As a life time liberal supporter, I say its time for the Prime Minister to resign immediately, and time for Ms. Wilson Raybould to be the next Prime Minister. In my riding, which is Tory held, but a winnable race for the Liberals, I really want to support the Liberal candidate (a future cabinet minister) but due to this scandal, feel forced to vote for the Green party now unless Trudeau steps down.

More and more pundits are shaking their heads in regards to Trudeau’s responses to their questions. However given the uniqueness of his personality his response are perfectly consistent.

1. Unable to admit wrong
2. Blaming others
3. Changing his story
4. Projecting his own shortcomings onto his adversary
5. Showing little anxiety when being confronted
6. Vindictiveness
7. Offering shallow explanations.
8. Controlling
9. Lying
10. Condescending
11. Blind to the opinions of others
12. Lacking empathy.

My guess is that Warren’s legal comments, which are appearing all over the place, must drive him wild.

Bingo. And here when something like this happens is what leaders should do.

1. Buck stops at the top, take responsibility
2. Apologize and admit you made a mistake
3. Promise never to do it again and put something in to prevent this.
4. Mention that you are human being and like all imperfect, but you believe in learning from your mistakes and will strive to avoid them.
5. Show humility
6. Show you care about voters concerns and that you share their frustrations, make it about Canadians not yourself.
7. Listen to others
8. Promise to in the future seek advice from a wider circle and maybe shake up inner circle

JWR testimony has sealed the necessity for an RCMP investigation of the Prime Minister and his office and charges to follow under the criminal code of canada..we can all look the exact charges up and present them to the RCMP if they prove they dont want to and want to cover it up.

We need to subpoena the RCMP Deputy Commissioner Michaud and rake him over the coals with very hard hitting questions. I could give a whole bunch of questions to ask. Im sure Warren Kinsella could ask the same questions I have.

Very despicable when trolls try to attack JWR with racial slurs. She is a Canadian woman with courage and her courage kicks the crap out of the people she worked with in government.

Anyone attacking JWR clearly are individuals who have no problem breaking the laws, circumventing the laws, criminally threatening an individual to break or circumvent the laws and who breach the public trust, obstruct justice and believe they are above the law.

The RCMP have been put on notice by hundreds of thousand of Canadians to do their job and press charges because there is no way out of it for this present government and no way for you RCMP to circumvent the law and look the other way.

Rather amusing looking at the comments of people and a Mr. Ialanni states that JWR went against the PMO the Minister of Finance and the Privy and did not accept their advice.

Then that is followed by a great comment by a poster who states the obvious that Jody Wilson Raybould is a lawyer and the PMO and the Minister of Finance and the Privy are not so why as a lawyer would she listen to them and go against the law.

What a great way to silence the mouths of those who lack a brain to see the clear picture and love to wear blindfolds so as not to see the corruption and they try to make other people wear the blindfolds to cover the corruption.

I’m saddened, but not surprised, to learn today that polling indicates the Justin Liberals are down in every region of the country except Quebec and – where I come from – Atlantic Canada. Maybe Harper was on to something with that “culture of defeat” moment of honesty. While its clear that Liberals have shifted from “she can’t speak French”, to “Scott wants to be a ‘stay-at-home daddy in Nova Scotia’ while working for a Bank in Toronto”- to “Its JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” – we know its about “VOTES!VOTES!VOTES!” AS Trump is to his base, Justin’s Liberals are to theirs. Will Quebec and Atlantic Canada be a big enough base? NB: Alberta is in need of jobs too. Wakey, Wakey Liberal Caucus. The Hangman is coming for breakfast.

Speaking of media roundup, was listening to Andrew Krystal’s show on Sirius when I was running errands.

His take on this was that the CPC would not have done a thing differently, (which I do find believable) and that Trudeau’s biggest mistake was giving such an unqualified person like JWR the posting in the first place. As far as he’s concerned she is doing nothing more than grandstanding and trying to bring as many down around her as possible, and all the media attention is little more than hypocritical teeth gnashing & hand wringing.

Since I know you’re an occasional guest on his show Warren, what’s your take on this?

I’d love to hear you on his show discussing this very thing.

1st. It seems hard to believe that the ones (CPC) who brought in the anti-corruption law being discussed here would be the same ones who would have ignore it. If the CPC would have wanted some type of loophole in the legislation – they would have done it.

2nd. Not clear why JWR would want to bring down those around her. She is obviously staying a Liberal, so what benefit is there for her to destroy her chances of being in government.

There *are* larger issues at play here. As she said, she’s well aware of what happens when governments ignore the law.

As for her political career, it may keep her out of the current PM’s good graces – for as long as that matters, which may not be more than a few months. However, by standing firm she has established credibility with everyone except the most cult-like Trudeauites. There are plenty of people saying already that they’d be delighted to have her as PM herself. It may be an overreaction, but the sentiment is there.

Whether she stays with the Liberal party as an MP, or joins/forms another party, or decides to pursue her aims outside of Parliament altogether, she has only added to her general stature in the long run.

Billions in fines have been paid, corporate reorganizations have taken place, but companies aren’t being dragged into court.”

Completely irrelevant. The Minister made her decision. That should have been the end of it. Period. And because they refuse to stand down, they can kiss off Ontario and BC…

Note how cabinet is not legislatively mandated to reverse her decision.

The most disturbing thing about the whole testimony was this statement from Telford as recounted by JWR;

Wilson-Raybould said the pressure escalated later that month with contacts from PMO officials. Butts and Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford “summoned” Prince to a Dec. 18 meeting, saying the situation was getting worse and that they felt she wasn’t doing anything.
According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Telford suggested they could line up people to write op-eds to say what she is doing is “proper.”

The fact that they were confident they could also strong arm the media to go along says a lot. Thankfully there are one or two principled journalists still out there. What else has the media been complacent about?

You’re right and why isn’t anyone in the media making this point?

Wouldn’t this put them in a position dramatically expand operations and thus hire most of SNC’s former employees?

I read JWR’s speaking notes that were published in full in the Globe yesterday. Absolutely damning. Part of the problem for the Liberals is that it wasn’t just one or two incidents of interference; it was a whole bunch.

The other thing that killed me was that on multiple occasions, somebody (including JT himself) would clearly pressure JWR on this matter but then say to her “but I’m not interfering”, or words to that effect. It’s like some mob enforcer sticking a gun in your mouth but then saying “hey, but I’m not threatening you.”

The point that seems to be overlooked by the folks insisting that no law was broken I suggest they reread the part about how the AG is a portfolio that is not considered a cabinet position but of the legal branch of the government. This means that cabinet has no authority to direct the AG once they have made a decision. Up until the moment a decision is made a member of the other branches of government or anyone outside of government is free to discuss a matter with them with the caveat that the AG can stop the discussion at their discretion if they feel it crosses the line.
Simpler explanation, the AG is not a member of the cabinet and therefore has no responsibility to them and the cabinet (including PM) has no authority over them except to fire them.
Also
As I am lead to believe per the act, the Director of Public Prosecutions has absolute authority. That word, absolute has a lot of legal weight or so I understand, that is sort of the same as sole discretion over a decision and nobody else.
That once the decision is made, its not up for discussion and like any legal decision may be subject to judicial appeal (a day in court) but not to a debate inside caucus or the PMO.
If I haven’t got the facts straight my apologies and I stand corrected. But if anyone tried to counteract that decision after it was made by pressuring the AG then a case can be made for interference in a criminal prosecution.

I get the feeling that Trudeau is about to try and “change the channel” by calling a snap election soon after the budget is tabled. Why?

-make the cornerstone of your budget and election platform the “jobs, jobs, jobs…Scary, Scary Harper” mantra of your already well-rehearsed shtick
-refuse to sign JWR’s nomination papers rather than
have to boot her from caucus
-focus the media (and your #KatiesKronies “op-ed’s”) on election coverage
-this shuts down parliament and…more importantly committees
-limit the time Trudeau has to bleed out before election day
-beat the start of the Norman trial, potential RCMP investigation and ethic’s probe to the punch
-the public perception can more easily be swayed into thinking this Lavscam thing is all just partisan electioneering by opposition parties during an election
-it also forces your opposition to divert serious time, resources and efforts into an election campaign
-don’t give Jagmeet Singh time to gain momentum

The chance of them successfully winning a majority are (I would imagine) extremely slim. Minority? Uhm…maybe. But most importantly they have to avoid the Ontario Liberal “mini-van” caucus result and try to at least hold on to official opposition status.

OK…I’ve convinced myself anyway ????

If Trudeau is at all inclusive he will keep JWR in caucus. If he boots her from caucus he will feel the wrath of the feminist/Marxist base. Harper would have booted her by now so I see Trudeau as much more mature than Harper would have ever been in similar circumstance.

Liberals are entitled to curry favour with Quebec nearing election. Harper could never curry favour with Quebec on his best days. In my estimation the whole JWR debacle will peter out when the Norman trial fires up. Only the dedicated pundits will hang on to the JWR affair after that turns to yesterday’s news. People on talk radio in Ottawa are starting to complain about the media fixation on the JWR issue to the exclusion of other more pertinent issues de jour.

I also think that JWR is pretty well the first AG that had issues with the PMO & PM with respect to jurisprudence.
I don’t recall any AG ever stepping out on caucus in the past?

All in all it’s a good learning experience so far on the curve for moi. Trudeau will scrape out of this by the time the Norman trial pushes the next shuffle on media. Scheer could not make the RCMP open a criminal file either, eh.

I think the Liberal powers that be have dramatically overstepped what is right and proper.

Trudeau, and those in his office and Cabinet, have overplayed their hand. JWR is honorable and is publically showing the corruption of the Liberal inner circle for what it is. Rotten at the core. The Liberals are not pursuing Sunny Ways now, if they ever did. I.e., electoral reform, aboriginal reconciliation, the environment (pipeline insanity).

If you want to chase what I think is the “bad guy” in this, look at SNC-Lavalin. IMHO, as bad as they come. IMO, the Cons are dirty with the Liberals and SNC as well. They got a sweet-heart deal to “buy” AECL for negative $60M and then still get hundreds of millions s year from “Parliament “.

If SNC moves from Canada, all of the SNC/AECL assets and IP should be repatriated ASAP. If not, that will be the true theft and crime.

Should Trudesu resign? Perhaps. Could he be defeated at the polls – I am hopeful. By the Cons – I am fearful.

But will they? There are people openly saying that they’d vote for her as Prime Minister. And many Liberals have been trying very hard to have it both ways (what a surprise) by saying they have faith in the PM, but refusing to call JWR a liar – suggesting instead that she just perceived things differently, or was telling “her truth”, or similar garbage.

I think Liberals care about holding on to power. If they believe that they stand a better chance in future elections with JWR – say, 2023 – they will be sure to keep her in the party. Or welcome her back in the fold once the current leader is thrown out after losing in October.

Vancouverois,

You know that I’m hardly an impartial observer, being a Liberal, but I think Justin has to take the hit for the team. He has to do what Ignatieff did to save the Liberal brand. In other words, the PM has to lead them into a losing election and then depart for educational pastures. If Liberals are truly smart, they will leave JWR alone and not remove her from caucus.

The party needs to remain credible in the public’s eyes, especially if Scheer can only manage a minority. Then we must find our MacEachen and take Scheer down in the subsequent election under our new leader.

Sad for all the idealists out there but politics will always be a cynical proposition.

Delighted with your thinking Warren. 9,000 jobs lost?….Rubbish. Worthy Capital projects get financed and built regardless!!

So with the jobs angle debunked, we Canadians want a ‘Rock’ for Attorny General.

Justin Trudeau jumps too quickly to the pulling of strings. Seems not to be a real leader.

First, the snap purchase of a pipeline that could have gone forward with a re-routing and a binding end date. That would have cost zero tax dollars.

Second, the jump to please SNC Lavalin by pushing and then removing Jody Wilson-Raybould who is the best and most solid Attorney General that Canada could hope for. These immature political moves cause thinking Canadian voters to vote NDP or Green and signal the end of the Trudeau / Liberal run.

Had Justin just stopped to think for a day or two, it may have come to him that saving the day would simply mean admitting that pressuring Jody Wilson-Raybould was an error and to restore her as Attorney General.

Justin would then be seen as a leader and not a puppet dancing on SNC Lavalin strings.

This is so obvious now to Canadian voters that the Liberal Party is doomed to failure this October.

Jody Wilson-Raybould may eventually sue the Canadian Government for a huge settlement for crass unfair treatment and damages.

Goodbye Justin. TG

IMO the Quebec government and the Caisse de depot (which owns 20% of SNC-L) would not let SNC-L move its headquarters to London without a *massive* fight. Additionally, SNC-L cannot move its HQ out of Quebec until 2024 as per a loan agreement with the Caisse. As such, I don’t see a move happening regardless of the outcome of this affair.

The threat of moving HQ is pure bluster.

Jim,

I would argue that the Caisse has the short end of the stick. What are Legault and the Caisse going to do IF Bruce and the board decide to hightail it to London? Are they going to cancel those loans that keep Quebecers employed?

It’s still far too early to predict a Liberal loss in October. This is a step in that direction, but there’s far too much time between now and then to guarantee that the tide won’t turn in their favour once more.

Vancouverois,

I predicted Harper’s loss before pretty much everybody. Let’s see if I’ll be 2 for 2 in predicting a Scheer minority.

But as a Liberal, I’m comforted by Scheer as an ALREADY potential walking-mistake-magnet. He goofed big-time with WIPM!

“When I am Prime Minister”? That’s certainly a mistake, but it’s more than half a year until the vote – if he abandons that tone now, I doubt it will be remembered by then.

What I fond interesting about all this is that ultimately it is all about a procurement policy. Why did they not quietly change the policy? Why sneak a law through and then pressure with respect to that law?

It is interesting how laws are bent or ignored while policies are sacrosanct.

So let’s just cut to the chase – forget all else! What were the reasons the Director of Public Prosecutions did not choose to proceed with a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin? This is the real information “inquiring minds” are looking for! Or as I suspect will her decision remain shrouded in mystery for millennia – or at least until someone in her office leaks it. Gotta love Canadian politics!!! And when will the collective we realize it’s all just a s**t sandwich with all the lawyers on one side, all the politicians on the other with us in the middle!

Smuggling of Qaddafi family to Mexico.
Thousands of $ illegally to LPC
And this;
SNC – DPA, Patricia Hughes
Founding Executive Director, Law Commission of Ontario (2007-2015);

“if the organization is alleged to have committed an offence under section 3 or 4 of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the prosecutor must not consider the national economic interest, the potential effect on relations with a state other than Canada or the identity of the organization or individual involved.” This would apply in the SNC-Lavalin case.”

Apparently you need to reflect some more, notwithstanding your moniker.

No, its not about “lawyers and politicians”. Its about corruption and the Rule of Law. You best do a little more “reflecting” before you submit that Op-Ed.

Without flaming Max I would suggest he read my comment again. The point I was making was that according to the legislation it’s the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, who in concert with her staff make the decision as to offer a Deferred Prosecution Agreement to an offending company. JWR was simply (as her duty as the Attorney General is spelled out in the legislation) reviewing the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions which she obviously must have agreed with. I assume that both made their respective decisions based on the information available to them which would have been much more than that which is available to us. So these non-disclosed tidbits are what “inquiring minds” would like to learn about. Finally, if I was so inclined I would also address your points about corruption and the Rule of Law but I gave up many years ago caring about the lives and thoughts of politicians, lawyers and blowhards. Or to paraphrase something that I think Warren would agree with “it’s all about the 5!” Of course I’m talking here about the MC5 who lit the greatest flame to my consciousness and conscience.

‘An Inconvenient Truth’. That about sums up who and what JWR is, eh Warren? Come to think of it, Trump and Trudeau have a lot in common. Who knew? Both lie. Both treat woman badly. Both bully. Both have henchmen to do their dirty work. Both make promises they have no intention of keeping. Both perpetuate “fake news” (aka ‘friendly Op-Eds’ in Canada) Both will do whatever it takes for VOTES and get Re-elected. Sad. And here comes Butts. Circling back to go nuclear. Trudeau is all in now. The same guy who professes to have done nothing wrong inexplicably quit his job so as not to be a distraction to the vital work of his best bud Justin, has a change of heart. Whereas he slipped out of dodge without facing the media nor volunteering to appear before the Commission/Committee, with full benefit of JWR going first, now has found his “perspective and opinion and facts”. Bring it on Gerry. For now it truly is about votes and elections. And Papineau. And the Assembly of First Nations is watching.

I was not surprised when I heard that Morneau’s Chief of Staff Ben Chin was ramping up the pressure on @Puglaas. Chin is a British-style political staffer, which implies antiquated management and negotiating techniques. Now that Butts is gone, Chin could be behind much of which is coming out of Ottawa now. The Liberal Party of Canada would do well to exile Chin to some diplomatic posting in a place which is at the antipodes of Canada.

Harper was the one who brought in the law to separate prosecution from the AG. (National Post had a good article last week – “Harper set a corruption trap and caught a Liberal”.
This change, plus the Ethics Act, were in place for 9 years and not a single Harper Minister was caught in it (I think a former MP was). Now just over 3 years later they have caught Trudeau 5 times, Morneau once, and then this mother of all scandals occurred.
I’d say the evidence suggests that Harper would have never done this.

The best part of this scandal is that no one on the PMO seem to expected JWR to actually be competent, rather than a token of its meta progressive righteousness. She could not have been more compelling in her presentation last week. So rather than focus on Team Trudeau’s setup of an indigenous woman for a fall, consider the victory of intelligence and integrity against manipulation and entitlement.

556,Warren Kinsella,Your morning #LavScam roundup,2019-03-04 08:30:00,Warren,,"There’s been a lot going on since the last round-up. It’s all going swimmingly, as you can see.

(If you’ve got one to share that I’ve missed, do so in comments with source, please.)
Richard Martineau, Journal de Montreal: “And was it because of empathy for workers that Trudeau wanted to save SNC-Lavalin? No. Because Justin needs votes in Quebec to win his next election…If Quebecers continue supporting Trudeau now, in spite of this attack on the independence of the justice system, we are imbeciles.”
“David Olive, Toronto Star: “The Trudeau “war room” is dug in, expecting the current outrage to subside. But the Grit brand will be further weakened by still more allegations to come of unseemly conduct by Trudeau and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The unpopularity of the PMO is widespread in this government. The PMO’s pressure on Wilson-Raybould is but one of countless acts of meddling in the work of cabinet officers, committee chairs and backbenchers.”
Toronto Star poll: “57 per cent said the situation has “worsened” their opinion of Trudeau, versus 36 per cent who said it has had “no effect” and 7 per cent who said their view of the prime minister has been improved by the situation.”
Chantal Hebert, Star: “Another week of political drama on Parliament Hill finds the SNC-Lavalin affair no closer to closure. In the aftermath of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at the Commons justice committee, even the future of the prime minister as Liberal leader has become fair game for speculation. If anything, the former attorney general’s testimony has left many Canadians with more questions than definitive answers.”
Royson James, Star: “[The]prime minister is throwing the woman under the bus. And the clerk of the Privy Council, a top bureaucrat on nobody’s radar except political animals, tries to undercut her by suggesting that if she felt pressure in her job as attorney general, that’s par for the course. In short, “Suck it up lady. That’s how the big boys play the game. If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Indigenous advocates and women’s groups and Canadians attuned to the issues and now confused by the black cloud threatening the sunny ways they’d welcomed just yesterday responded with outrage and concern.”
Globe and Mail poll: “More than half of Canadians say fraud and corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. should go to a criminal trial rather than a negotiated settlement where the Montreal engineering and construction giant would pay fines and avoid prosecution, according to a new survey.”
John Ibbitson, Globe: “In the absence of doing the right thing – calling an election to let the people decide this issue – the smart thing for the Liberals is to do nothing that will prolong the agony of this scandal. Fresh testimony, even if it bolsters their case, will only drag things on, increasing the risk that Mr. Trudeau himself might be forced to testify, requiring him to do something he has refused to do for three straight weeks: respond to a direct question with a direct answer.”
Shelby Blackley, Globe: “Courage is clearly innate for Ms. Wilson-Raybould, but maybe it was bolstered by the support of women near and far. After Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the federal cabinet on Feb. 12, the hashtag #StandwithJody began trending. Fellow MPs such as Jane Philpott, and Celina Caesar-Chavannes, among others, voiced their support.”
Campbell Clark, Globe: “Firing attacks at Ms. Wilson-Raybould…clearly backfired. Mr. Trudeau had made a milestone of her appointment as the first female Indigenous justice minister in 2015. Accusations that the PMO was “smearing” Ms. Wilson-Raybould dented Mr. Trudeau’s political brand. She has seized the high ground.”
Globe editorial board: “If the Trudeau government has any hope of seeing the back of the SNC-Lavalin scandal, it has to put its full version of the story, all of it, in front of the Canadian people. Perfunctory denials won’t do. The allegations made by former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould are too serious. That the allegations go to the very top, and come from one of the government’s most senior members, makes them unprecedented.”
Kelly McParland, National Post: “Jody Wilson-Raybould was clear, credible, straightforward and eminently convincing. Anyone outside a hardened partisan would have to conclude this was a strong woman who held firm beliefs and had stood by them under extreme duress from powerful men.”
Andrew Coyne, Post: “Unless you think Wilson-Raybould is flat out lying, something has gone very wrong with the culture of this government. I don’t mean the desire to spare the company’s employees from hardship, or even the concern for the political repercussions in Quebec, but the apparently widespread assumption that the way to attend to these was to corrupt a prosecution and trample over the independence of the attorney general.”
National Post editorial board: “What is the prime minister waiting for? His friend and confidant Butts will have a chance to speak, as will Wernick, for a second time now. Wilson-Raybould, for her part, should be given the chance to flesh out what Liberal MPs have been dismissing as her inaccurate version of things, unfettered by potential self-serving limits imposed by the prime minister. That would be the prime minister, you’ll remember, who once pledged to lead the most transparent government in Canadian history. The people of Canada are eager for answers, and there are numerous people willing to speak. Let’s hear what they have to say — all of them, and all of it.”
CTV News Nanos poll: “One in four Canadians say the SNC-Lavalin scandal will influence their vote in the next federal election – and the political fallout appears to be growing, according to a new Nanos survey…Before the former attorney general testified, 14 per cent of respondents said they considered Trudeau the most ethical federal leader. At the time, Trudeau ranked third behind Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, at 23 per cent, and Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer, at 21 per cent. But by Friday, Trudeau had sunk to 10 per cent support, putting him in the fourth spot behind NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who held 11 per cent.”
Paul Wells, Maclean’s: “THE MORAL CATASTROPHE OF JUSTIN TRUDEAU…Unless the Trudeau Liberals can produce persuasive evidence that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an utter fabulist (and frankly, I now expect several to try), her testimony before the Commons Justice Committee establishes pretty clearly that the hucksters and worse were running the show. Led by the grinning legatee who taints the Prime Ministers’ office…What the former attorney general described is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along.”
Anne Kingston, Maclean’s: “We’re talking Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting here. Clearly the “No” registered on the SNC-Lavalin DPA on Sept. 4, Sept. 17, Oct. 7, Dec. 19 did not register as an actual or final decision. As for pressure? She must be imagining things! After all, the decision was Wilson-Raybould’s alone to make. And the insurance kicker: If Wilson-Raybould did feel she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute, it was up to her to protest to the very office applying pressure, or resign. If she didn’t, well, it’s nobody’s fault but hers. Her behaviour is the problem. As I said, it’s an age-old template. As for “How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say ‘No?’ before being heard?” It’s a trick question. The correct answer: Zero.”
Leah McLaren, The Guardian: “Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau – proud feminist, defender of minority rights, advocate for transparency, inclusivity and decency, and prince of the one-armed push-up – was morally eviscerated over four-hours of astonishing testimony by his own former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould – a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister…Trudeau’s behaviour was way beyond the bounds of what was fair or decent. It was sleazy, plain and simple. And for a leader whose entire brand identity, right down to the toes of his cotton rainbow socks, is based on fairness and decency, that’s pure political poison.”
Paul Wells, Maclean’s: “Long story short, the government of Canada was telling one story to itself and another to Canadians. To themselves, they said they were protecting jobs. To the rest of us, they said they were getting tough. A government that indulges in that much sustained double-talk clearly thinks it has something to hide. It’s being disingenuous. It’s being phony. And since the lot of them never stop calling themselves #TeamTrudeau on Twitter, I guess we can, without fear of contradiction, say the Prime Minister of Canada has been the phony-in-chief…She wanted to back the country’s public prosecutor, to let a court do what courts do every day: weigh and judge. He wanted to change the rules mid-game and hope we wouldn’t notice. And the problem for Trudeau—who came to power promising a new era of transparency—is that this phoniness is a trait he shows all too often.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

<p>(If you’ve got one to share that I’ve missed, do so in comments with source, please.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Martineau, Journal de Montreal:</strong> “And was it because of empathy for workers that Trudeau wanted to save SNC-Lavalin? No. Because Justin needs votes in Quebec to win his next election…If Quebecers continue supporting Trudeau now, in spite of this attack on the independence of the justice system, we are imbeciles.”</li>
<li><strong>“David Olive, Toronto Star:</strong> “The Trudeau “war room” is dug in, expecting the current outrage to subside. But the Grit brand will be further weakened by still more allegations to come of unseemly conduct by Trudeau and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The unpopularity of the PMO is widespread in this government. The PMO’s pressure on Wilson-Raybould is but one of countless acts of meddling in the work of cabinet officers, committee chairs and backbenchers.”</li>
<li><strong>Toronto Star poll:&nbsp;</strong>“57 per cent said the situation has “worsened” their opinion of Trudeau, versus 36 per cent who said it has had “no effect” and 7 per cent who said their view of the prime minister has been improved by the situation.”</li>
<li><strong>Chantal Hebert, Star:</strong> &nbsp;“Another week of political drama on Parliament Hill finds the <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/pmo-scandal.html"">SNC-Lavalin affair</a> no closer to closure. In the aftermath of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at the Commons justice committee, even the future of the prime minister as Liberal leader has become fair game for speculation. &nbsp;If anything, the former attorney general’s testimony has left many Canadians with more questions than definitive answers.”</li>
<li><strong>Royson James, Star:</strong> “[The]prime minister is throwing the woman under the bus. And the clerk of the Privy Council, a top bureaucrat on nobody’s radar except political animals, tries to undercut her by suggesting that if she felt pressure in her job as attorney general, that’s par for the course. In short, “Suck it up lady. That’s how the big boys play the game. If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Indigenous advocates and women’s groups and Canadians attuned to the issues and now confused by the black cloud threatening the sunny ways they’d welcomed just yesterday responded with outrage and concern.”</li>
<li><strong>Globe and Mail poll:</strong> “More than half of Canadians say fraud and corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. should go to a criminal trial rather than a negotiated settlement where the Montreal engineering and construction giant would pay fines and avoid prosecution, according to a new survey.”</li>
<li><strong>John Ibbitson, Globe:</strong> “In the absence of doing the right thing – calling an election to let the people decide this issue – the smart thing for the Liberals is to do nothing that will prolong the agony of this scandal. Fresh testimony, even if it bolsters their case, will only drag things on, increasing the risk that Mr. Trudeau himself might be forced to testify, requiring him to do something he has refused to do for three straight weeks: respond to a direct question with a direct answer.”</li>
<li><strong>Shelby Blackley, Globe:</strong> “Courage is clearly innate for Ms. Wilson-Raybould, but maybe it was bolstered by the support of women near and far. After Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the federal cabinet on Feb. 12, the hashtag #StandwithJody began trending.

<li><strong>Campbell Clark, Globe:</strong> “Firing attacks at Ms. Wilson-Raybould…clearly backfired.

Unfortunately, as per Nanos Poll (who has lots of credibility), SNC scandal will impact the vote of only 1 in 4 Canadians. You can bet this will have even less impact once we get closer to the election.

Harper didn’t win because of Ad scam, but because he offered a methodical 5 step plan that included 2% drop in HST and tax breaks directly to families.

Trudeau won because he offered “modest 10 billion deficit and growth”. Had Harper focused on his 0 deficit, best economy in G7 and the newly European agreement instead of his “Trudeau-not-ready” obsession, he may be still in power – at least as minority.

Next lection will be won by whoever offers better economical plan, not less scandals.

“It’s the economy stupid”.

At the end, the electorate consider all politicians corrupt, and look for the ones who can benefit them more. On that matter, the Liberals have a landslide advantage through all kind of freebees and irresponsible new expenses. If Sheer can offer something reasonable and substantial plan, he may have a chance. If he focus on scandals, Liberals will bounce back.

There nothing more in me that would like to see this fraud of PM gone. However, I am stating the obvious in the Canadian politics and electorate. Trudeau is copying Obama’s playbook for reelection:-Pander to social activists and minorities.
-Distribute goodies.
-Vilify the alternative (Sheer).
-Request more time to terminate his “social revolution” (yes we can, but we need more time).

Trudeau only lifted the waiver on what JWR could say up to the time she was demoted from the Justice portfolio, but it’s still in place for whatever transpired afterwards. So – what is so awful that he doesn’t want her to talk about? Her testimony was damaging – are we to infer that what she isn’t allowed to say is even more damaging?

Warren says:

I believe he was trying to manage her testimony, and offering her a quid pro quo. And that happened while she was at VA, and that’s what he doesn’t want to come out.

It’s never the break-in. It’s always the cover-up.

The Gropenfeuhrer has a history of using indigenous folks as props. Thus we saw his use of Patrick Brazeau who “fit the narrative” so he could try and look tough to prop up his image. Thus we see how he appointed Jody Wilson-Raybould as AG in order to fit his diversity/feminist facade. When he no longer needed to do so, he jettisoned her. This man is a vile hypocrite…..how anyone with any sense of morality can support him is beyond me.

Remember Chief Theresa Spence, the remarkably well fed hunger striker from the Attawapiskat band. The opposition parties of the day led by Bob Rae and Thomas Mulcair shamelessly exploited that situation to their own political advantage. Trudeau just has taken virtue signaling to a new level, ultimately every move made for political gain.

Actually, as I remember it, didn’t Mulcair have the good sense to stay away? Perhaps I’m wrong, but I thought JT was the only one who tried to capitalize on her protest.

“By all indications, Wilson-Raybould does not plan to be done with politics. She has plenty of personal electoral capital to spend on staying in the game. But she may have to look to the provincial scene in her home-province of British Columbia where she is said to be close to NDP Premier John Horgan rather than to the national stage for a bright future.”

John Ibbitson wrote that Trudeau ”has refused ….. for three straight weeks: respond to a direct question with a direct answer.” Correction: Trudeau has NEVER responded with a direct answer! Some time ago, I read an interview with Thomas Mulcair in the Journal de Montréal, where he said that as leader of the Opposition, it would frustrate him to no end that whenever he asked JT a question, JT would invariably spout platitudes that had little or nothing to do wih the actual question being asked. Mulcair added that while he despised many of Harper’s policies, he respected Harper for actually answering questions put to him.

550,Warren Kinsella,Your March 5 #LavScam roundup,2019-03-05 10:51:00,Warren,,"Above: a Trudeau supporter physically attacks a protestor at Justin Trudeau’s rally in Toronto last night. Where – I’m not making this up! – they played Michael Jackson songs – on the same night ‘Leaving Neverland’ was airing.

And the great reviews keep rolling in!
Globe Ipsos poll: “Most Canadians side with Wilson-Raybould, believe Trudeau has lost moral authority to govern: Ipsos poll…A majority of Canadians are keeping tabs on the SNC-Lavalin affair and that doesn’t bode well for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted exclusively for Global News. If an election were held tomorrow, Trudeau would receive only 31 per cent of the decided popular vote — down three points from a couple of weeks ago — while Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer would receive 40 per cent, according to the poll of 1,000 Canadians carried out between March 1 and March 4….“This is the first time we’ve actually seen the Conservative Party resuscitated and looking like they could potentially form the government,” said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. “The Liberals, on the other hand, have been dropping precipitously over the space of the last few weeks. The question is have they hit bottom yet?”
• Susan Delacourt, Toronto Star: “Justin Trudeau has no political playbook to counter this rare implosion…Philpott has exited Trudeau’s cabinet in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould bolted: explosively, unexpectedly and clearly in full recognition of the massive damage it would cause to the boss, the government and the chances of the Liberals being re-elected this fall. Together, they are a double-barrelled shot to the heart of all that was supposed to be the shiny new brand of the Trudeau government: one far more friendly to women, Indigenous people and rookie politicians such as Philpott and Wilson-Raybould.”
Chantal Hebert, Star: “Justin Trudeau was damaged goods before Treasury Board PresidentJane Philpott followed her friend and former colleague Jody Wilson-Raybould out of his cabinet. It is far from certain that he can recover from this latest blow to his moral authority and repair his reputation as a competent prime minister in time for the election. [Losing Philpott may be] politically fatal. It certainly screams ineptitude at crisis management on the part of a prime minister. With Philpott’s resignation — offered in support of Wilson-Raybould — the SNC-Lavalin affair enters a new lethal phase for the prime minister. Until further notice, all bets are off as to its outcome.”
Star editorial board: “So far the prime minister has failed to present a robust counter-narrative to the damning story about political interference in judicial matters told by his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould…It’s plain that Trudeau’s commitment to a gender-balanced cabinet and to making progress on Indigenous affairs had significance that eluded him at the time. He ended up with ministers at the cabinet table who took his rhetoric about change seriously and weren’t prepared to compromise their principles just to get along. There is abundant irony in how Trudeau’s professed principles have come back to bite him in unexpected ways.”
Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail: “Losing one cabinet minister who resigns on principle can be considered a misfortune. Losing two smacks of crisis. If any other cabinet minister had quit Justin Trudeau’s cabinet after Jody Wilson-Raybould’s stand in the SNC-Lavalin affair, it would have been bad. When it is Jane Philpott, a paragon of principle who is no pie-eyed dreamer, it is Mr. Trudeau’s government falling apart from the inside.”
John Ibbitson, Globe: “This is a civil war, one Mr. Trudeau may not survive. Just to start, what kind of government shuffles its cabinet three times in two months? There are those who say the SNC-Lavalin scandal is a tempest in a teacup – or a nothingburger, to update the cliché. No it’s not. Granted, most people don’t follow the day-to-day jousts of the blood sport known as politics. But this is a political crisis like no other, because of the characters involved…We are witnessing a personal vote of non-confidence in the Prime Minister by some of his most senior cabinet ministers, based on his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, but also over disillusion with Mr. Trudeau’s leadership.”
Lori Turnbull, Globe: “Ms. Philpott’s resignation from cabinet is nothing short of catastrophic for the government…One effect of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is that there’s now a clear line in the sand and the beginnings of a civil war in the Liberal fold. The grey area in which MPs could plead to be both loyal to the Prime Minister and sympathetic to Jody Wilson-Raybould is quickly disappearing. They have to choose a side. Ms. Philpott has made hers clear. If others follow her lead, the Prime Minister’s confidence problem worsens.”
Matt Gurney, National Post: “It’s not just the women quitting in disgust that’s going to cause Prime Minister Justin Trudeau so much trouble. That’s bad enough, to be sure. But it’s what they’re saying as they head out the door that’ll do the real damage…Philpott’s been watching and learning. She’s seen what happened to Wilson-Raybould. She did this anyway, and at a time and place of her choosing, even after the Liberals tried to hurt Wilson-Raybould’s reputation with whispers, whispers that got so bad Trudeau felt compelled to apologize for what his own colleagues were saying. Philpott knew that might be coming, so she made her case clear as day — and it’s devastating for Trudeau. Like I said, Liberals — have fun spinning this one.”
Kelly McParland, Post: “Justin Trudeau wanted strong women. He sure got ’em. That they’ve found him wanting and are willing to say so is proof of his success. It clearly never occurred to him they might take their job seriously enough to question his own performance…It turns out women really aren’t just like men, and aren’t necessarily afraid to stand by their beliefs. Philpott’s public declaration that she no longer has confidence in the prime minister — specifically his handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy — is as damaging an assertion as can be made by a senior government minister against her leader. As she points out in her resignation letter, “the constitutional convention of Cabinet solidarity means, among other things, that ministers are expected to defend all Cabinet decisions. A minister must always be prepared to defend other ministers publicly, and must speak in support of the government and its policies.” Given the convention “and the current circumstances, “ she writes “it is untenable for me to continue to serve as a Cabinet minister.”
Brian Lilley, Toronto Sun: “For a government that has branded itself as feminist, as gender balanced, as supportive of women, the loss of yet another powerful woman around the cabinet table is beyond bad news. On the SNC-Lavalin file, the Trudeau Liberals have shown that they don’t know what “no” actually means and now the women in the party are fighting back. Losing Philpott is no small matter for Justin Trudeau.”
Robyn Urback, CBC News: “If Jane Philpott doesn’t have confidence in Justin Trudeau, why should anyone else?…A million more Freeland-type ovations can’t undo what Philpott did in a few hundred words: she told the doe-eyed #TeamTrudeau hangers-on that their faith in this government is misplaced. And she said she would not be able to fulfil her duties as a minister if it meant publicly defending the government. That’s a devastating message from her especially; Philpott is capable, venerable and widely respected both in and out of Liberal circles. She can’t be written off as a cabinet minister disgruntled about a demotion or an opposition leader out for blood. Philpott is a Liberal — a widely admired one — and she doesn’t have faith in the prime minister. And if she doesn’t, as someone privy to the conversations around the cabinet table about this whole affair, why should anyone else?”
Paul Wells, Maclean’s: “With Jane Philpott’s resignation from the cabinet, Justin Trudeau’s government is now in a crisis that ranks with the coalition challenge to Stephen Harper in 2008 and Jean Chrétien’s dismissal of Paul Martin in 2002. That probably understates matters, actually: Those two previous shocks were about ambition; they engaged matters of principle almost by accident. This one is a direct challenge to a government by two (and counting?) ministers with no perceptible ambitions beyond their former posts—though buckle up, because they’ll both be accused of scheming—on the gravest grounds of ethics….Every cabinet minister, and every Liberal member of Parliament, has a decision to make right now. Today. We are about to find out who is serious, and who merely plays serious on Instagram…A country gets into trouble when it turns every question into an electoral question. The party stripe of the government is not the only interesting question.

<p>And the great reviews keep rolling in!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Globe Ipsos poll:</strong> “Most Canadians side with Wilson-Raybould, believe Trudeau has lost moral authority to govern: Ipsos poll…A majority of Canadians are keeping tabs on the <a href=""http://www.globalnews.ca/tag/snc-lavalin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SNC-Lavalin</a> affair and that doesn’t bode well for Prime Minister <a href=""http://www.globalnews.ca/tag/justin-trudeau"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Justin Trudeau</a>, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted exclusively for Global News. If an election were held tomorrow, Trudeau would receive only 31 per cent of the decided popular vote — down three points from a couple of weeks ago — while Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer would receive 40 per cent, according to the poll of 1,000 Canadians carried out between March 1 and March 4….“This is the first time we’ve actually seen the Conservative Party resuscitated and looking like they could potentially form the government,” said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. “The Liberals, on the other hand, have been dropping precipitously over the space of the last few weeks. The question is have they hit bottom yet?”<br>
<strong>• Susan Delacourt, Toronto Star:</strong> “Justin Trudeau has no political playbook to counter this rare implosion…Philpott has exited Trudeau’s cabinet in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould bolted: explosively, unexpectedly and clearly in full recognition of the massive damage it would cause to the boss, the government and the chances of the Liberals being re-elected this fall. Together, they are a double-barrelled shot to the heart of all that was supposed to be the shiny new brand of the Trudeau government: one far more friendly to women, Indigenous people and rookie politicians such as Philpott and Wilson-Raybould.”</li>
<li><strong>Chantal Hebert, Star:</strong> “Justin Trudeau was damaged goods before Treasury Board President<a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/03/04/jane-philpott-liberal-mp-resigns-from-trudeau-cabinet-over-snc-lavalin-affair.html""> Jane Philpott followed </a>her friend and former colleague Jody Wilson-Raybould out of his cabinet. It is far from certain that he can recover from this latest blow to his moral authority and repair his reputation as a competent prime minister in time for the election. [Losing Philpott may be] politically fatal. It certainly screams ineptitude at crisis management on the part of a prime minister. With Philpott’s resignation — offered in support of Wilson-Raybould — the <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/politics/pmo-scandal.html"">SNC-Lavalin affair</a> enters a new lethal phase for the prime minister. Until further notice, all bets are off as to its outcome.”</li>
<li><strong>Star editorial board:</strong> &nbsp;“So far the prime minister has failed to present a robust counter-narrative to the damning story about political interference in judicial matters told by his former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould…It’s plain that Trudeau’s commitment to a gender-balanced cabinet and to making progress on Indigenous affairs had significance that eluded him at the time. He ended up with ministers at the cabinet table who took his rhetoric about change seriously and weren’t prepared to compromise their principles just to get along. There is abundant irony in how Trudeau’s professed principles have come back to bite him in unexpected ways.”</li>
<li><strong>Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail:</strong> &nbsp;“Losing one cabinet minister who resigns on principle can be considered a misfortune. Losing two smacks of crisis. If any other cabinet minister had quit Justin Trudeau’s cabinet after Jody Wilson-Raybould’s stand in the SNC-Lavalin affair, it would have been bad. When it is Jane Philpott, a paragon of principle who is no pie-eyed dreamer, it is Mr. Trudeau’s government falling apart from the inside.”</li>
<li><strong>John Ibbitson, Globe:</strong> &nbsp;“This is a civil war, one Mr. Trudeau may not survive. Just to start, what kind of government shuffles its cabinet three times in two months? There are those who say the SNC-Lavalin scandal is a tempest in a teacup – or a nothingburger, to update the cliché. No it’s not. Granted, most people don’t follow the day-to-day jousts of the blood sport known as politics. But this is a political crisis like no other, because of the characters involved…We are witnessing a personal vote of non-confidence in the Prime Minister by some of his most senior cabinet ministers, based on his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, but also over disillusion with Mr. Trudeau’s leadership.”</li>
<li><strong>Lori Turnbull, Globe:</strong> “Ms. Philpott’s resignation from cabinet is nothing short of catastrophic for the government…One effect of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is that there’s now a clear line in the sand and the beginnings of a civil war in the Liberal fold. The grey area in which MPs could plead to be both loyal to the Prime Minister and sympathetic to Jody Wilson-Raybould is quickly disappearing. They have to choose a side. Ms. Philpott has made hers clear. If others follow her lead, the Prime Minister’s confidence problem worsens.”</li>
<li><strong>Matt Gurney, National Post:</strong> “It’s not just the women quitting in disgust that’s going to cause Prime Minister Justin Trudeau so much trouble. That’s bad enough, to be sure. But it’s what they’re saying as they head out the door that’ll do the real damage…Philpott’s been watching and learning. She’s seen what happened to Wilson-Raybould.

Scheer is plain vanilla, which is the Liberals’ worst nightmare. With nothing to attack, the spotlight is on them, and that isn’t exactly a good thing these days. Don’t forget, he’s a cagey one, too. Bernier had the nomination locked up but he recognized the rules of the game in the leadership race and took a pro-dairy stance (who cares) for the win. All he has to do is stay calm and keep saying “Hi, I’m not Justin Trudeau” and he’ll be the next Prime Minister of Canada.

The poll is definitely bad news for Trudeau, but just a snapshot not predictor, but I will say this, before Lavscam Trudeau still had a decent chance of winning a majority, now the odds are much lower and while still possible he is going to have to pivot and do so fast if he wants to keep his majority as the window to change the narrative is fast closing. In 2016, the best the Tories could hope for was to hold the 99 seats they won. In 2017 it was to gain seats and close the gap with the Liberals but beating them in seats seemed impossible. After India Trip debacle last year the idea of a Tory minority seemed plausible, but a majority was not. With this a Tory majority is now no longer a pie in the sky idea, it is actually possible. It is not the most likely outcome at the moment, but what was impossible a month ago is at least possible now and if Trudeau continues to double down, it just might become likely before e-day.

Trudeau would be best to come out and take full ownership, apologize saying he didn’t fully understand the gravity of this, but has learned from his mistakes and in the future he will listen a bit more to his cabinet ministers and when he disagrees try to find some kind of compromise not push his way. Will he do this? I don’t know but he should, but somehow I am skeptical he will.

Here’s the real scandal:In the system we have, the PM must consolidate power and manage his or her trained seals (MPs and Cabinet Ministers). Trudeau has not kicked these two out of caucus: That is the scandal. Leaders make tough decisions but this one is easy:– Trudeau must enforce discipline Especially when actions are designed to actively undermine the government.
– the gender of the cabinet ministers should not be made an issue here; if someone does something wrong we don’t make acceptions for gender otherwise we are engaging the bigotry of lowered expectations.
– Philpott was fielding calls at JWRs House and that’s the factoid that caused this to hit the fan. Timing was off.
– You cannot separate the leader from the party without a leadership challenge; if this is Gillard v Rudd Canada style then Trudeau really ought to trigger the challenge now;
– You cannot get away with leaving the cabinet due to a lack of confidence in your leader and then stay in caucus;
– if you cannot speak French you shouldn’t really be plotting a leadership challenge (fun fact)
– if I was Warren Kinsella, whom was all admire, I’d place a call to Chrétien who knows caucus solidarity well and who should advise Trudeau, 1) to bring Warren on side into the PMO, 2) and withhold nominating papers for any cabinet minister that thinks abandoning their leader makes any sense without a leadership challenge.

Guaranteed, any such “statement of contrition” will be as botched and patently false as Trudeau’s public “reflections” after the reports of his groping / assault of B.C. reporter Rose Knight in 2000 resurfaced in the media over a year ago. Remember how Trudeau refused to genuinely accept any responsibility for that incident and instead tried to turn it into a holier-than-thou “teachable moment” where he could lecture people on consent and sexual ethics? Nobody bought his sanctimonious crap then, and few will fall for his attempt at being contrite now.

Speaking of Trudeau’s groping incident, are Liberal caucus members really blind to the prospect that another groping / assault allegation will likely surface in the coming months, dooming their chances of holding on to their own seats.

How can an apology be contrite if you find it necessary to even debate whether it should even be given or not? Why even bother, then?

There is not an ounce of genuiness in his whole body.

What’s the saying? “Sincerity is key – once you can fake that, you’ve got it made.”

As somebody (I believe it was Andrew Coyne) noted, they’re treating this like a game. They seem to think that if only they can come up with the right moves, that will give them a cheat code to get out of it.

If Trudeau is serious about expressing remorse, then he must reinstate Jody Wilson-Reyboukd as Minister is Justice and Attorney General and return Jane Philpott to Treasury Board.

No coordination between Trudeau’s strategists and Butt”. LOL.
Until yesterday, it was almost certain that Butt would do everything to discredit JWR. With the new Liberal strategy, expect him to adopt a conciliatory tone tomorrow, opening the way to his former boss ‘s apologies and crocodile tears in the coming days.”
With the Media spin op-eds, expect this saga to die in a couple of weeks. “Back to Trump”.

Trudeau and Telford apparently “own” a former Supreme Court justice. A former Supreme Court justice is apparently willing to help politically interfere in a criminal trial. This apparently is the Canada we live in.

Breaking news: lawyers are consistently holding back productive public policy beyond the scope of this car accident. Lawyers are the ones saying “Yeah, but no! Too risky to fix reserve tap water! Leave it to us professionals to collect a commission in lieu of actual solutions, my boss is 64 and isn’t interested in x or y.” In short, Lawyers are the reason politicians are so disappointing. And it’s the millennials who dodged the curse of legal accountancy that will put a quota on the number of lawyers in public office. In the name of diversity. Diversity based on the content of our character which insistently correlates well with ethnic and gender diversity.

With the exception of Housefather, he’s cool.

So, they not lawyers wanted the opinion of a “jurist” to settle the matter because this was “new law”. Who was going to select this “jurist”. Was he/she going to be non-partisan? How does one determine that?
I think JWR was correct this was a matter of rule of law not partisan decision making. Unless, they were planning to take this to the Supreme Court to decide? Likely not!

Wasn’t JWR herself the one who drafted the DPA law in the first place – or at least had her department draft it?

I mean, she *was* the Minister of Justice, right?

I would expect her to be absolutely aware of every aspect of it. Who could possibly give her more advice on a law that was drafted under her own watch?

Prosecutorial independence is NOT new law. JWR was agnostic on remediation agreements. She was not agnostic on the government of the day directing an independent prosecutor to take a particular action or to take the case away from an independent prosecutor.

She did not think it was appropriate to the AG to make a directive is a particular criminal case. It really had nothing to do with the wisdom of remediation agreements.

As a side note, I very much liked Elizabeth May’s question about *how* they “knew” that SNC-Lavalin would be in trouble if prosecuted, when the company’s own reports indicate otherwise.

And in a follow-up question to Wernick, she gets him to state that the only body to do an actual analysis of the economic impact was – the Ministry of Justice!

And yet they insisted that JWR needed more information from *them* in order to make a decision.

Reply


Vancouverois says: 

March 6, 2019 at 4:27 pm

And now in the post-committee scrum, she’s really emphasizing that point – when SNC-Lavalin leaned on the Trudeau Liberals, they jumped, without bothering to verify their dire claims independently.

Vancouverois says:

And now she’s sweetly pointing out that logically, they should just have promoted Joyce Murray to the Treasury Board position without moving JWR or Jane Philpott – *if* they weren’t actually trying to bump JWR out so Lametti could grant a DPA as ordered, that is. Which of course she doesn’t think was the real reason.

I can’t tell whether she’s sincere about that last bit. But that’s part of the charm. ^_^

The problem with Butts hearing is that he has already been established as an operator…

Shockingly, from a persuasion stand point, his testimony was not very memorable, nor compelling. What images do we have? Scruffy looking guy, it was about what he didn’t get; a formal letter from JWR, that this all happened after the demotion. He talked about what didn’t happen, the characterizations have fallen flat.

Hearing Edward Prutcshi (sp?) on CTV.

He made a point about the DPA legislation and who wrote it.
Parsphrasing
It wasn’t new to the PMO and it has the appearance that it was written explicitly for SNC

Two people can have vastly different perspectives on the same conversation.

I thought Justin Trudeau, in his 2015 Election Campaign, was going to do politics differently, was all about sunny ways and respecting diversity and the equality of women, was going to lead the nation in reconciliation with Canada’s First Nations, and was going to lead the most open government ever.

Justin Trudeau thought that these were platitudes designed to get him elected.

543,Warren Kinsella,Your morning #LavScam: the New York Times calls it “a spreading mess” and “a major blow”,2019-03-07 01:54:00,Warren,,"I’ll be on CTV Your Morning today around 7, after Trudeau speaks this morning, and also doing the radio tying over on the mighty Newstalk 1010.

This is the sort of thing I’ll be talking about: it didn’t go well, yesterday. At all.
Editorial board of the New York Times: “OH, TRUDEAU. CHARM WILL NOT EXTRICATE CANADA’S JUSTIN TRUDEAU FROM A SPREADING POLITICAL MESS. ONLY HONEST ANSWERS WILL….With seven months to go before Canada’s next national election, the prime minister is embroiled in a political scandal that his charm cannot wipe away. Two members of his cabinet, both prominent women, have resigned, as has his closest adviser, and unless he can convince the public — and do so soon — that he really did nothing wrong in trying to head off the criminal prosecution of a big Montreal-based company, the damage will only get more serious….in Canada, the tangled SNC-Lavalin affair is unavoidably measured against the expectations Mr. Trudeau raised and the standards he set. For him to be accused by two prominent women from his team of violating the high ethical bar he himself set is a major blow.”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “Butts offered little that contradicted what she had earlier told the committee — that she was pressured to overrule the decision of the director of public prosecutions to proceed with charges of fraud and corruption against SNC-Lavalin, rather than to offer it the remediation agreement it had sought…It was Wilson-Raybould’s decision to make, as long as she decided it their way.”
John Ibbitson, Globe and Mail: “The testimony of the former principal secretary to Justin Trudeau left so many questions unanswered that the committee will need to examine other witnesses – perhaps including the Prime Minister – ensuring front-page headlines for weeks to come. But what matters politically is that we have passed a tipping point. Mr. Butts’s testimony was just another episode in a political melodrama that will run till election day in October. It has become for the Liberals what the Senate expenses scandal was for Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.”
Konrad Yakabuski, Globe: “Mr. Butts presented himself as only a tangential actor in the whole SNC-Lavalin saga. That is hard to believe, given the pivotal role he played in every major decision taken by this government until his Feb. 18 resignation. It is even harder to believe that his staff in the PMO were not acting on his explicit direction in making pleas to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, even invoking, according to her testimony, the electoral consequences in Quebec of failing to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid prosecution on fraud and corruption charges involving its Libyan operations. Mr. Butts more than once described protecting the 9,000 Canadian jobs at SNC-Lavalin as “a public-policy problem of the highest order.” Yet, we are supposed to believe that the Prime Minister’s top adviser, one with his hands in every other file, barely played a role in this one?”
John Ibbitson, Globe: “Ms. Wilson-Raybould has a right to respond to contradictions between her version of events and Mr. Butts’s – especially concerning the cabinet shuffle that removed her as attorney-general. Most important, Mr. Trudeau has never offered direct answers to direct questions on what he said to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, or what directions he gave his senior staff regarding the prosecution. He needs to provide those answers…But there are no good options for the Liberals. Either the justice committee will continue to hear evidence from witnesses in the coming weeks, further fuelling this five-alarm controversy, or the Liberal majority on the committee will prevent further testimony, which would be the contemporary equivalent of the St. Laurent government imposing closure during the Trans Canada Pipeline debate in 1956. That cost the Liberals the next election.”
Toronto Star editorial board: “Trudeau should own his role in SNC-Lavalin mess…the testimony by Butts and the return appearance by the Clerk of the Privy Council, the pugnacious Michael Wernick, begs a host of questions…the Prime Minister should not simply exhale and go back to fronting jobs-and-climate rallies. His cabinet and caucus may be gathering around, but he and his government have taken a real hit in the country. He should step up and tell his own story. There were clearly missteps along the way, in particular the loss of Wilson-Raybould, who played a key role in the government for a host of reasons both substantive and symbolic. She signalled her misgivings over how the SNC-Lavalin issue was being handled to numerous people in government…Trudeau and the PMO should have been more attuned to what she was saying, not just fault her for what she didn’t. And they certainly should have known better than to try and make her serve as Indigenous services minister, an impossible position for someone with her background. Much was mishandled here and the government has been badly wounded. The prime minister should own up to his role in this fiasco.”
Terry Glavin, National Post: “The bigshots in Trudeau’s inner circle do not hold the foundational democratic principle of the rule of law to be especially sacrosanct after all. With all the cabinet resignations and committee-hearing drama, and the public astonishment with the creepiness of the whole thing, 73 per cent of Liberal voters, even, say the RCMP should be brought in to sort things out…Liberal party rhetoric is increasingly and predictably taking on exactly the tenor and tone you’d expect of a personality cult. This is why it’s been so exceedingly difficult to make sense of whether there’s any merit in Team Trudeau’s sketchy and inarticulate answers to the more important questions at hand. Was the persistent hounding of Wilson-Raybould really within the bounds of collegial cabinet issue-probing?”
John Ivison, National Post: “One senior MP, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the overriding mood is of disappointment in the prime minister’s leadership. “The caucus is united in a desire to get re-elected. It is not necessarily united in a desire to be elected behind him,” they said…More importantly for the Liberals, Trudeau needs to demonstrate to his caucus and the country that he can handle a crisis he has helped to agitate. The recurring complaint in caucus is that Trudeau doesn’t ask MPs what they think, beyond the “cool crowd” of personal friends in cabinet or the “Praetorian guard” in the PMO…We are at a defining moment in Canadian politics and, even if he survives, nothing will be the same again for Trudeau. The spell has been broken and the idea that he could be a one-term wonder is no longer implausible. “The disappointment is palpable,” said one Liberal MP. “This is a crisis and he’s been found wanting.”
Brian Lilley, Sun: “If Gerry Butts went to the House of Commons justice committee hoping to help his best friend and former boss, he failed…he essentially used the same excuse that Trudeau had used to explain away groping allegations that plagued him last summer. Why wouldn’t these frat boys return to the same excuse? It worked last time! The testimony from Butts was in many ways a repeat over and over again of Liberal talking points on why there was no inappropriate pressure on the attorney general.”
Neil Macdonald, CBC: “Trudeau’s verbal porridge and serene smile have carried him along. Until now. He either doesn’t think the public deserves a straight answer, or just isn’t capable of delivering one…With his government sinking into a self-inflicted crisis, it’s beginning to appear that Justin Trudeau simply doesn’t have the intellectual acuity to cope. Look at his response to the testimony of Jody Wilson-Raybould last week. She had just finished delivering a measured, unambiguous indictment, accusing him and his staff of attempting to pervert justice for political gain. He could have answered his former justice minister fact for fact. Instead, Trudeau appeared a few hours later in Montreal, two rows of nervously smiling party volunteers arranged behind him, a newly elected MP standing haplessly to the side. His statements were as stilted and contrived as the optics. And so on. Not a spontaneous syllable, not a second of candour or actual reflection. Certainly no substantive reply to Wilson-Raybould’s remarkably serious accusations. Trudeau could have talked about the difficulty of having one member of cabinet coexisting as both a political minister and attorney general, a problem Wilson-Raybould herself addressed, but no. He could have given his own version of discussions with her. But no. This is a man who either doesn’t think the public deserves a straight answer, or just isn’t capable of delivering one.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Up until now I admit to being a Lavscam skeptic. I just didn’t think it could compete with Cohen’s testimony involving Trump, Russians, election fixing, and adult entertainers.

Except now Lavscam has wrestled even the New York Times’ attention away from Cohen-gate. That’s impressive!

March 7, 2019 at 6:10 am

Well, let us not get our hair into an entire frizzle about certain Liberals. The redoubtable, ha ha, Andrew Scheer is also involved, whether peripherally or not we do not know. Yet.

There was a public consultation on the RAR, Remediation Agreement Regime (Canada’s DPA), in 2017. Don’t remember it? Gee, neither do I. Must have been Front and Centre in the news. Crimes by big company execs to be excused by fines alone – that’ll keep ’em honest all right. Your neoliberal betters at work on your behalf, dear Canadian serfs.

Therefore, buried in the March Budget last year was the Bill for RAR, cunningly placed there in harper-like Omnibus Budget-fashion to change the country for the neoliberal best, by the Finance Minister, himself a well-manicured patrician convinced of his own essential honesty – based on his past angry responses when questioned on other matters such as how his company would benefit from measures he had passed in Parliament. Wood and trees.

RAR was proclaimed into law last June. However, during April/18 SNC-L was already sniffing around to see whether they could benefit from RAR, so says the SNC-L entry in Wikipedia! Of all sources. Why yes, of course SNC-L were highly interested, since it was/is not inconceivable that RAR was introduced in the first place to assist them. Ahem. Say it isn’t so Gerry …

On May 29/18, according to the Toronto Star from Feb 10 this year, Andrew Scheer met with SNC-L to discuss the RAR – BEFORE it was even proclaimed into law in fact. Why naturally. How appropriate! Andy likes to keep up with things beyond posing in semi-truck cabs with very white men. It would be interesting to know the slant of that meeting, given Scheer’s current caterwauling about Trudeau. Are the Cons raring to go to give SNC-L the Prairie/Ford/Legault nod of approval if they win the next election? Can I be allowed to be cynical about all politicians, especially those on a metaphorical golden steed leading a charge?

For me, the real ass-kicker is the duplicitous to me, anyway, testimony of Wernick. I am at a loss to understand why a public servant should be given two kicks at the can in Commons Commitee to basically proclaim what a bloody great guy he is and to issue Grandpappy-style warnings to the Canadian body politic. Shades of Ollie North. I’d fire the guy now, but he’s safe since he’s repeating the company, er PMO, line to back up the evidence-less Butts, whose hazy memory on detail is at odds with his sharpness, and who couldn’t be bothered to collect up his texts and emails on the JW-R affair to rebut her testimony. No, we must merely rely on his memory.

Too bad it all rings hollow, but Wernick approves of course – no undue pressure was applied to the AG, no sir. Just different interpretation of the continuous prodding she and her staff were subjected to on the need to see the big picture and to seek a spot of advice from some retired SCC justice. Who cares about the Public Prosecution Service and their work? There’s an upset company to placate. And jobs jobs jobs. So the Commons Justice Committee, being majority Liberal, are not requiring Gerry to gather up his evidence for public view, if it even exists – his memory will suffice. The official fix is in.

Forgive me if I am not feeling the love for the Libs and Cons, and busybody public servants+PMO operativeas intent on keeping their records clean. It’s government for the big corporate boys no matter the stripe of major party in power, and as plebs plodding around in our daily lives paying taxes, we seem to be last on anyone’s priority list, except as sources of revenue to paper over the occasional crack in the facade when the big boys slip up.

We badly need a new political outlook in this country. Not the he said she said stuff on a single issue, but fundamental change. The forces of reaction and justification are gathering strength in this particular case, but if anyone out there thinks going Con is going to help us to root out political sleaze, you’re living a daydream. It’ll just be new faces gorging at the trough with appropriate staff to provide justification for questionable decisions, very few of which will be for your and my benefit, fellow peons.

I’m thoroughly cheesed off. People gallivanting about trying to make hay of the moment do not impress me much either.

.. a note from the horde, seeing as we’ve paid careful & non polarized & non partisan attention to all that’s led to & including the Butts testimony & Q & A.. as well as having the astonishing ability to count to 4 – Yes a guy named Brison also resigned.. and yes that Ex Commander Norman criminal trial is steaming towards the whole l’affaire Lavalin shebang.. there will be a collision

Note) Mr Butts dropped an enormous hanging & steaming clue begging a simple question in front of the Justice Committee & nobody twitched.. shocking! Were they all asleep at the wheel ? How about MainMedia (which surely does not include Brian Lilley) Zero recognition – flat line

Well OK.. One of the key questions has always been in regard to the two lines Ms Wilson-Reybould could draw through her detailed chronology & notes. One line being the absolute legal cutoff point.. ie a specific date (relative to what she and Ms Roussel have identified as the commencement of a trial) There has to be some point in time where discussion, talk, urging, considering etc etc, no longer is acceptable legally, a Rubicon, see you in court, the paperwork is signed.. whatever.. its over Rover

Our tiny amphibious tails twitched in excitement when Mr Butts dropped the bomb. ‘They’ had received legal advice.. or a legal understanding – that up until a verdict was reached, the consideration, urging, could continue (9,000 jobs etc) whereas ‘Jody’s’ decision was final in just 12 days.

Who sprang to action, asking who had supplied such legal opinion or interpretation of law (ie non political, but legal reality on the Law or recent amendment) Well uh.. exactly nobody.. and as far as we can see and read (and trust me, we can get really close to the page) .. no illustrious scribe, no learned hack, no editor.. Hell, not even a single political animal like Andrew Scheer pondered that aloud, nor his vaunted ‘war room’.. even the venemous Harper wonderboy Michael Cooper dozed while poisonous Poilievre rocked painfully in his seat clutching at some troublesome crawling flesh on his neck

Thus Butts declared a rink to skate on and nobody noticed ? If he can validate a clear legal right to pester, urge, challenge the Attorney General.. then she can be painted by others as ‘difficult’ .. or even the most damning & scurrilous.. a woman.. unable to cope or deal with pressure.. or as CTV’s & breathless Even Solomon’s guest panel hack Christy Clark suggests.. ‘just another big ego arguing around a cabinet table’

The Justice Committee, conducted their inquiry in a “Kangaroo Court” fashion. The Liberal members of the Committee blocked motions for further documents relevant to the case to be brought forward and be examined, the re-examination and further testimony of the former Attorney General, Ms. Jody Wilson – Raybould , and in many cases asked leading questions to the witnesses in order to achieve their own Liberal Party end state. Their style of conduct clearly indicates lack of transparency, Liberal agendas with aim of discrediting the former Attorney General, and a staged communications plan to dilute the essence of the inquiry. This is not the way of conducting unbiased inquiries and we should all reflect on this type of mockery and take action otherwise this whole issue will be swept under the carpet. I am not advocating for any political party but rather highlighting the lack of transparency of our politicians and the lack of moral courage to show integrity on such issues.

I enjoyed reading this sardonic essay.

I wonder if this is a moment where the kind of change in outlook you speak of might actually take shape. I find JWR and JP to be the most compelling political figures in the country. If they were to leave LPC by will or expulsion (the latter even better, if LPC leadership is stupid enough to do something so catastrophically damning), I would very seriously considering parking my vote with whatever party they next joined or created.

There is this opportunity right now, for these genuine, effective, no-bullshit, real leaders to become the vehicle for something actually transformative. They have the kind of record and moral and ethical authority that lends legitimacy to boldness. They were front and centre with pretty much every memorable, good thing this government has done, apart from Freeland as a strong diplomatic figure. (She is in the middle for flushing her credibility down the toilet with her affirmation of Trudeau’s godliness, unfortunately.) They are of strong enough character that they can instil faith in voters: faith in their ethical operation of government, faith in their principles, faith in their ability to deliver substantive results. They are worth entrusting with important government policy and business.

I really don’t want this unfolding story to lose its momentum — JT is basically politically dead to me, and I’m kind of hoping he will be to everyone else too. The only chances my vote will be red now is if the party changes leadership (and there are basically two replacement leaders that I’d find acceptable), or if my MP (who seems to be good) clearly makes public that he stands with JWR and JP. Even then, if JT is leader, I don’t know.

I’ve been watching this scandal closely. Three items jumped out:1) David Aiken from Global and Lisa Raitt highlighted that the potential loss of 9,000 jobs has no source. Given that protecting jobs is so central to the Liberal’s argument, one would think they would have tasked an independent party to come up with a number. Did the 9,000 value come starting from an SNC lobbyist?
2) David Aiken pointed out that SNC cannot move its head office until 2024. The company has a loan from the Caisse secured with SNC’s interest in the 407 ETR. Would SNC really walk away from one of its most profitable assets?
3) Lisa Raitt is coming across as a super star

Mr. Trudeau seems incapable of really taking responsibility for this situation, which indicates to me that this government has no intention of making any changes in the way it operates. The PMO will continue to run the show; the Privy Clerk will continue to believe that he has a direct line to the Almighty (God, not the PM): David Lametti will overturn the decision of the DPP and grant SNC Lavalin a DPA: and everything will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds: the Liberal world.

Justin cries at everything he thinks he can get mileage on. He has apologized for everything in history on behalf of Canadians . Now that it truly matters he does neither.
He is not fit to lead this country, he and his people are elitists and can’t connect with the people they were elected by. They were elected to do things by the rule of law, not 9,000 jobs for Quebec. What about Alberta and the thousands of jobs actually lost due to their inability to follow the laws legally?

I don’t think he should apologize for stuff if he doesn’t feel apologetic. Like I tell my kids, an insincere apology means very little. Which is to demonstrate the problem – he doesn’t see himself as responsible for this problem, and he doesn’t feel at fault. Lack of apology is maybe somewhat honest, whereas fake apology is transparently meaningless. Either way, I’ve no use for JT in our politics at the present time. Very unhappy with him.

.. yesterday Butts – today, Trudeau reiterated
At this point, only Paul Wells noted yesterday they have been going with the belief that a PDA may be extended up to and including a vedict after a trial.

Why has this, the very nut of l’affaire Lavalin not be clarified, comfirmed or disproven.. Surely the Law or new Amendment is not so nebulous, arcane or vague ?

Why has anyone bothered thinking or becoming polarized if no rule or law has been broken.. because we don’t even know what the law says ?

Who provided such a legal opinion to the Trudeau Government & when ? Was it written on a yellow post it note ? A la BC’s or Ontario’s former provincial governments ? Was it only whispered in a hallway or elevator ?

What does Ms Roussel or Ms Wilson-Reybould believe to be true ? I find it incomprehensible that a criminal trial would be prosecuted and a verdict delivered.. and OUR Attorney General could or would then say.. PDA, your Honor..

I do believe the Government could ask the punishment be mitigated in some way, after a conviction or verdict.. but do not believe what I am seeing here.. ie all this useless polarization, even hysteria, the gum flapping and hissing of MainMedia, idiotic suppositions.. when nobody thought to examine where the goal line or boundaries were, the rules of engagement or propriety.

Even Aussie Rules football has clearly defined ‘rules’ – fishing may be declared ‘poaching’ when out of season, hockey has ‘penalty shots’ and a clock, archery has a bullseye, not a field of dreams archers aim at.. and only skating awards points from a Russian judge for ‘artistic impression’ .. and last I looked, Andrew Scheer neither plays hockey or holds a degree in Criminal Law

Can we please see said Law in print.. can we also see or measure the legal opinion Butts & Trudeau are both referencing in context to said law ?

Exactly right. People understand politicians make mistakes as we are all human, but they expect those who do to own up and take responsibility not look for excuses and blame others. As mentioned in an earlier one, how Gordon Campbell in BC handled his DUI in 2003 (he got re-elected two more times after that) is what you do when you do something that cannot be easily justified. What Trudeau has done is what you don’t do. Heck even Paul Martin’s response to sponsorship scandal were he was upset what happened looks far better and to be fair at least Paul Martin was not directly implicated unlike Trudeau.

This is what Trudeau should have said from the beginning but did not: “Growing the middle class and helping those who want to join it has always been my top priority as government. I was very concerned the potential of 9,000 job losses would cause and failed to realize the seriousness of this. I sincerely apologize for how I handled this and this is a learning lesson for me as no one is perfect and we all make mistakes, but what matters is do you learn from your mistakes and avoid them in the future. This is a learning experience for me and in the future I promise to consult more widely within my cabinet and caucus and also take into account other issues. My unwavering goal to grow the middle class and help those wanting to join it has not ended and I will continue to focus on this while ensuring we govern in an ethical and honest way” This is what I would have said had I been in his shoes and I think probably would have at least stopped the bleeding.

Poor young JUT he just hasn’t got the moral compass or gumption! He’s never had to apologize for being PET’s playboy offspring with a brand – playing @ politics. It’s going to take a surge of deep rooted fear to wring an apology out of this boy-man. Only visceral fear of crashing out of leadership and into minority government will do this.

The clock is ticking towards these twin scenarios.. So we wait on a hang dog mea culpa when there is a little bit more distance between his current brutal humbling and the outcome of the SNC court proceedings.

Look back on the Chretien govt, they sure have improved with age. I didn’t love Chretien personally but he never oversaw the destruction of Canadas basic industries and institutions. I remember him directly supporting the west with real infrastructure projects and how they tamed the debt. Reforms rise was really a response to the Bloc and not a judgement on Chretien. I don’t remember any widespread animosity toward him and I liked those team Canada trips he did. The Quebec separation vote was an unintended fall out from the Mulroney govt.

Please don’t vote green. That’s a vote for more of the same the Trudeau liberals are dishing out.

The “unintended fallout” was largely due to the Mulroney government taking a f-18 maintenance contract won fair and square by a Winnipeg firm and giving it to a Montreal firm. Sound familiar?

Well, that incident wasn’t the cause of the separation vote as a symptom of its real cause – Mulroney’s adoption of pr0-separatist positions and pro-separatist rhetoric in order to get separatist votes.

On that score, it’s the Conservatives (and NDP) who now have the most to answer for. Their new policy of leaving all tax collection to the province is appallingly pro-separatist, and must not be allowed to happen.

As Justin said “its been a tough few weeks”, there was the arrogant, entitled, smug smirk. He just can help himself. And despite 9001 jobs at stake (including the member from Papineau) he wasn’t aware. His deputy minister Warner, his BFF for 30 years and Chief of Staff Gerry, Katie Telford and his Quecbec Advisor etc etc all “were aware” what JWR was clearly informing them, but JT was not looped in. One supposes its didn’t come up. I guess when his very first response was an unequivocal FALSE, he was in the dark. No one told the boss he was going down with 9000 others. Inconceivable! “

5. Scott resigned
6. I wasn’t aware.
7. No pressure.
8. No inappropriate pressure.
9. SNC Lavilin will leave for London.
10. 9000 jobs lost
11. 2 people can experience the same thing differently
12. Feelings, perceptions, interpretations, opinions.

I am trying to formulate an argument as to Mr T seemingly trying to justify special legal action , or inaction, on the basis of potential job losses.
Outside Quebec in matters related to drilling , refining, pipelines, rail shipping etc as a result of the government’s decisions, what is the estimate of jobs lost and estimated job losses?

March 8, 2019 at 10:31 am

Abour 110,000 direct energy industry jobs, and probably double that amount of indirect job losses.

Alberta lost 16,000 jobs just in the month of January 2019 alone.
The only Alberta job I want to see dissappear is that of MP Randy Boissenault (LIB, Edmonton-Centre).

His demeanour seems to me to be frantic.
Some more digging needs to happen as to T’s
connections to Quebec; it’s almost appears that there is a deep cover-up going on with the SNC story being the tip of the iceberg.

It all stinks. The UN, SNC, Liberals and the lack of regulation.

A summary of the commentariat, below:John Ibbitson, Globe and Mail: “At Thursday morning’s news conference, an unrepentant Justin Trudeau described the political crisis that has consumed his government as a failure to communicate. It was not. This crisis is about his failure to lead. And the news conference offered further proof of that failure.

Martha Hall Findlay, Globe and Mail: “Both former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have made significant and potentially seriously career-limiting moves based, they have said, on their principles. Doing so suggests a level of integrity that, as amply demonstrated by the shock value of their recent resignations from cabinet, is all too rare in politics…I prefer to believe that they did not resign because they are women; rather, because they are people with principles, which in turn guided their actions.”
John Ibbitson, Globe: “[Trudeau’s excuse is] a crock because Mr. Trudeau assumes no responsibility for a crisis that is entirely his fault. A good leader would be appalled that he had created a work environment so dysfunctional that a critical situation spun completely out of control without his even being aware of it. It’s a crock because the Prime Minister tacitly admitted at the news conference that he was willing to let economic and partisan political considerations influence the SNC-Lavalin prosecution – a blatant violation of the rule of law. And it’s a crock because Mr. Trudeau’s arrogance masquerading as humility throughout the news conference was so unconvincing. His unwillingness to apologize.”
Konrad Yakabuski, Globe and Mail: “Trudeau’s foreign fan club isn’t cheering any more…Mr. Trudeau’s global fan club has had a hard time processing the [LavScam] news.”
Campbell Clark, Globe: “Canadians were waiting to hear Trudeau’s full explanation on SNC-Lavalin – and they didn’t get it…Not an apology. Not really an act of contrition. Not a full-throated defence. Not a detailed accounting of events. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s press conference on the SNC-Lavalin affair included an assertion that there were lessons learned although he wasn’t terribly specific about which ones. So what was that?”
Gary Mason, Globe: “There was certainly some contrition – he wished things could have been handled differently, it’s an unfortunate situation from which he hopes to gain knowledge and perspective – but there was a disturbing lack of personal accountability. The whole matter seems to have been an unfortunate misunderstanding, if you believe the Prime Minister…he wants us to believe he was oblivious to any angst on her part until the cabinet shuffle in January. And not until then did he grasp the full extent of her enmity toward him and his coterie of advisers. Not a chance.”
Tanya Talaga, Toronto Star: “At first glance, there seems little to compare between the bullying of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by the prime minister and his staff and the treatment of Inuit by the Crown during the tuberculosis crisis. But both speak to a persistent colonial mindset, the kind of thinking that is a blight on our history and still pervades our government. On Thursday, Trudeau was to apologize to Inuit. He ought to do the same for Wilson-Raybould.”
Thomas Walkom, Star: “Justin Trudeau’s explanation of the SNC-Lavalin affair has explained little. The prime minister was supposed to put the issue to bed at an early-morning press conference Thursday. He did not succeed.”

But does he ever apologize for any of the flubs and blunders (or worse) that he is responsible for? In other words, he only every apologizes for the easy stuff; for the stuff that will make him look good with no skin off his nose.

Politics in a democracy has to be about just governance, and not money, power, and influence. The Liberals have done it under Trudeau; ensured that a waffling, urban voter like me who has in the past always voted on the basis of policy, and not party lines, will never, ever vote for their party federally again. Which is not to say I wouldn’t accept and welcome them in government led by the people of principal they’re pushing away. They just cannot count on my support anymore in getting there.

The offer to JWR to take the Indigenous Services portfolio is the chink in the Federal Liberal armor that is absolutely unbelievable on the surface of their argument. Initially I thought Butt’s testimony was wholly legitimate but today I am inclined to agree with CBC’s Barrera.

I am not an aboriginal Canadian but I have always thought that the Indian Act was an abomination culturally & socially.
The PMO cannot hide behind the manufactured testimony of Gerald Butts with regard to the offer made to JWR in haste. Clearly, it was a humiliating demotion designed to anger her and force her departure from cabinet & caucus.

Bottom line is that the people in the PMO are by no means that stupid. If they are indeed that dumb & uneducated I will apply to be the secretary.

As Indigenous Services, Wilson-Raybould would have no power to change the Indian Act. She would have to have been give Bennett’s portfolio, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations.

Barrera is right. The Indigenous Services ministry is more akin to administering “apartheid”, with the inability to change the legal relationship and structure was would is what the other ministry is tasked with undertaking.

The Mandela analogy is catchy, it’s sticky. Who ever came up with it knows master-level persuasion, *cough* Warren BUT the Indian Act is not analogous to Apartheid. Apartheid is not short hand for what the Indian Act does. It’s more complicated than that.

Saying you hate the Indian Act is like saying you hate Representative democracy. Rep Dem gets you disappointing results ie. party discipline…But what do you replace it with?

Indigenous leadership want a spectrum of alternatives ranging from a separate nation-state to self-government to…X…but the leadership does not want to shut down reserves as that is their source of power + cultural protection.

Minister of Indigenous Service can effect change from within.

Is ending it a priority of this government? Really?

I mean, they may have said so. But it’s been three and a half years already. Have they taken any concrete steps toward repealing or restructuring the Indian Act? I haven’t heard of it.

Admittedly I haven’t been paying that much attention to the file. Was there anything substantial that I missed?

From the Globe and Mail: “Wernick talked by phone with SNC Lavalin chair Kevin Lynch who was Clerk of the Privy Council from 2006 to 2009.”

Helluva coincidence that. Am I the only one wondering if the senior politicians and beaureaucrats in our government spend quite a lot of time preparing for their post-government careers? I wonder where Wernick and Trudeau figure they’ll land when they leave government and what are they doing now to pave the way?

Trudeau and Trump are just two sides of the same coin. The “teen” decade will be remembered as a period when democracies around the world reached “peak ambivalence” and started electing the most unqualified “leaders” they could find.

In the end, both of these imposters will be consigned to the trash heap of history, and our democracies will emerge (hopefully) with a renewed appreciation for the meritocracy , and a renewed visceral hatred for inherited privilege.

It is interesting that every report here is negative. Has no one considered that the “process” is indeed broken and must be fixed as JT suggests? The PM could have more clearly shown he had empathy for what JWR experienced and can understand her frustration based on her independent role as AG. That said, it would not have been wise for him to “apologize” for the outcomes given that the blame for the situation is shared. He is on the right track to focus on “how to fix it” and perhaps could have invited JWR to participate in a committee to do so.

Regarding shared blame… JWR should have been more clear to everyone in September that she could not take a second look at the DPP’s decision simply because the language used by colleagues about “elections” and “getting re-elected” (assuming that happened) permanently tainted the request. She should have said “the decision is final due to the appearance of political interference, based on what she could not “un-hear”, even if it was not intended”, and even if a second look was indeed the right thing to do for such new legislation.

Regarding process… JWR should have ensured all government colleagues including the PMO were then appropriately reminded on the importance of never crossing that line when in discussions with her given she was the AG, and that if they continued to press on this matter she would have to resign. It would have been a tough lesson to learn, but much easier than the one we are all are learning now! It also seems necessary to more clearly define “political interference”. For example, lawfully speaking up for the interests of thousands of Canadians is what we expect of our government and is what politicians and their staff should be doing every day! The request for a second opinion was not offside and was one of the options made available to her by her own staff given the newness of the DPA legislation. It was simply the manner in which the request was made initially, but she did not make that clear enough or stand firm enough.

No process can survive immoral unethical actors.

The Shawcross doctrine is easy to understand. The creation of the DPP, made the lines even clearer.

Since the creation of the DPP, there has been NO directives issued by the AG to the DPP with regards to a particular criminal case. Zero.

JWR saw the big flashing red lights. To issue a directive in a particular criminal case is an historic and probably dangerous thing to do. You know, the independence of prosecutorial discretion from politics.

Trudeau, Butts, and Wernick…on the other hand, what great time to go pedal to the metal and ignore the big flashing red lights.

Wernick is a guy who is everything that is wrong with the Canadian civil service. He has risen to the very top by not actually doing anything, but not fucking that up.

He got to Deputy Clerk by being DM for 8 years at INA (and then AAND) with nothing really terrible happening….in Ottawa. The hell with suicide rates, unsafe water, mold, etc., nothing ever caught fire where anyone care, so good job Mike. Rotate through PCO, don’t get caught holding the bag on anything. Before that, ADM at Heritage, a spend against unmeasurable objectives ministry, for 8 years.

Let’s not forget, he has been in charge for a period where the civil service has actually rendered itself incapable of paying itself, and until now, he has managed to keep himself completely isolated from the Phoenix fiasco. His problem now is that the spotlight has finally found him.

The analogy is about the TACTICS. Facepalm!

Trump exemplifies many of the tactics described in The War Room. So let’s not conflate policy with tactics.

And referencing examples everyone knows is for explanatory purposes. Like, obviously.

Meanwhile, calling for someone’s resignation is about rhetoric and appeals to emotion. Student’s call for resignations all the time. It has no weight and the upside is attention.

Siding with students is just goofy because once they enter the real world, these students will have regretted a lot of those politicking daze.

My God.

This is just…

We always knew that he made a big deal of being “feminist” in public, and saying all the right things that a “woke” feminist is supposed to.

We’ve already seen the gaslighting (“She experienced it differently.” “She did not come to me, and I wish she had.”)

We’ve seen the whispering campaign behind JWR’s back.

We’ve heard about how he tried to undermine her confidence by all but forcing her to get “an outside opinion”.

We’ve heard about how he wouldn’t take “no” for an answer.

We’ve heard him and his defenders invoke his supposed feminist credentials. We’ve witnessed him making a big show of not saying anything directly critical of his accusers, but instead trying to discredit them indirectly with a narrative that was carefully constructed to lead people to think that *they* were crazy, or over-emotional, or unreasonable and backstabbing, or all of these.

And now we have “He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn’t appreciate him, that he’d given me so much,”

This is a feminist Prime Minister? No. This is a serial abuser of women.

All of these actions are absolutely the tactics that an abuser uses in order to undermine his (or her) target, and keep that person isolated and afraid to seek help. They are textbook examples – TEXTBOOK – of how such people operate.

1) Celina Caesar-Chavaness is Not a Trained Seal.
2) Trudeau is weak on due diligence.

– A big problem with democracy is attracting diverse talent, you have to reconcile the talent with a) partisan trained seal status i.e warm voting bodies, b) aligning attributes like gender, ethnicity and language skills (PM is selected from a pool of 7M billingual Canadians, for example), c) the candidate is a winnable riding, d) competent decision-making with sound judgement. There are about 5 people who match all the above.

– Then you get a JWR and like buying that 9,000 jobs are at stake, you don’t press to verify the facts (not enough time!). You know, to see if this candidate might have a larger ego than her father who said she’s going to be prime minister…in 1983 and/or is SNC Lavalin’s future really at stake with a conviction?

-Case in point, CCC literally is saying she doesn’t dig partisan politics. And without being too critical of her, it would appear she was elevated easily in part on her diversity and she didn’t calibrate the weight of her choices on her family as a result: “I hope that when we talk about changing politics, we do it from a foundation of not everybody who is outside of your red, blue, or orange structure is the enemy, and not everything within the red, blue or orange has to be exactly the way you want it to be.” – Celina Caesar-Chavannes.

– The system hasn’t changed, Trudeau promoted within a system that is structured against voting your conscience. Selecting people based on the content of their character/judgement/warmbody yes,sir,no,sir status rather than the colour of their skin and gender delivers better “trained seals” which is what Westminster is designed for. It’s the system we have. Diversity based on attributes like skin colour or gender as the (major) determinant is a risky and flawed vetting process. No matter how noble.

“Diversity based on attributes like skin colour or gender as the (major) determinant is a risky and flawed vetting process. No matter how noble.”

Well said. Sadly, it gets votes from people gullible enough to believe that it’s cool and progressive. Trudeau must know this, but he also knows that optics are everything in politics (which is also pretty sad in itself). As long as everything keeps going smoothly and the narrative flows uninterrupted, all is well…when it doesn’t, the ‘spin doctors’ are unleashed to repair the damage and get things flowing again.

(hmmm…there’s plumbing metaphor here, but I won’t go there..;)

Bottom line: Trudeau is the author of his own misfortune.

How many times must it be said. TWO PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING DIFFERENTLY. Justin will learn from this, and we will do better.

534,Warren Kinsella,Your Saturday #LavScam roundup: Trudeau’s coddling of “ordinary evil”,2019-03-09 09:38:00,Warren,,"National Observer: “…the most depressing spectacle of the entire affair is watching Justin Trudeau, a man who clearly aspires to greatness, debase himself and this nation, by begging, pushing, imploring Canada’s attorney general to let this company off the hook. Then effectively firing her when she wouldn’t comply, and allowing her credibility to be undermined.”
National Observer: “A Canadian company is charged with bribing a family infamous around the world for murder, torture, rape, abductions, and widespread human rights abuses, and doing it for its own profit. They didn’t stop until the regime collapsed in 2011 and Swiss authorities came knocking. Charges were laid in April 2015. Because of corruption’s profoundly oppressive impact on the Libyan people, the SNC-Libya charges are vastly more serious even than the McGill hospital bribery scandal, in which SNC paid bribes of $22.5 million to secure the contract. Yet repeatedly and overwhelmingly from the prime minister and his advisors, the hand-wringing has focused on Canadian jobs, without substantiation of what the real job losses might be. Not a whisper for the innocent civilians trampled under a dictator’s boot. The kind of people who don’t have Michael Wernick’s mobile number.”
National Observer: “SNC knowingly enabled and overlooked monstrous tyranny and abuse. The company cannot pretend it was unaware of Gaddafi’s vicious cruelty while expensing his son Saadi Gaddafi’s prostitutes, lavish lifestyle, and showering him with millions of dollars a year. The company financed his soccer aspirations and sponsored his team despite widespread reports that, just a few years earlier, his bodyguards had opened fire on soccer fans for booing a referee favouring him. Between 20 and 50 were killed in the ensuing chaos.”
Susan Delacourt, Toronto Star: “International Women’s Day came and went in Canada on Friday without much fanfare by Justin Trudeau, who normally uses the occasion to burnish his feminist brand. That brand, like everything else around Trudeau this past month, has been tarnished by the ongoing SNC-Lavalin saga, which has cost the prime minister two strong women ministers and raised questions about whether he really walks the talk of new-style, female-friendly politics.”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “WHY FIGHT CRIMINAL CHARGES IN COURT WHEN YOU CAN LOBBY? SNC-Lavalin chose to fight the charges in government, rather than court. They did so, we may conclude, because they were given reason to believe it would work…At last the Liberal government has that outside legal opinion it was seeking. A federal court judge has ruled the director of public prosecutions’ decision to bring SNC-Lavalin to trial on charges of fraud and corruption, rather than to negotiate a “remediation agreement” as the company preferred, was a proper exercise of her prosecutorial discretion. By extension she has endorsed the former attorney general’s refusal to overrule that decision. For the flipside of prosecutorial discretion is prosecutorial independence, hallowed by centuries of common law and, as the judge wrote, “essential and fundamental to the criminal justice system.”
Colby Cosh, Post: “As we all dissect the Liberals’ SNC-Lavalin scandal, it is hard to even keep track of the multiple injuries to the Liberal party’s image and to Justin Trudeau’s. I am seeing a lot of remarks and jokes about Trudeau’s performative commitment to equality of the sexes, or about how serious evidence-based policy-making takes a back seat so quickly to a contrived panic about jobs….if you compound enough hypocrisy, shovel it into a big enough pile, it just becomes ordinary evil, doesn’t it?”
Andrew Coyne, Post: “The prime minister’s people seem to have reached down even further into the prosecutorial ranks. Bouchard allegedly told her chief of staff he understood “that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement, but the director does not.” As Wilson-Raybould mused to the committee, “I can’t help but wonder why he would bring that up. How he would know that. How he garnered that information.”
Christie Blatchford, Post: “A month to the day that the scandal first broke, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has managed the improbable — both confirming key details of the deposed attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony (i.e., she was telling the truth) and revealing his own shallow grasp of what constitutes improper interference with the justice system and its highest officers…The justice system depends upon a criminal case — every criminal case, from sexual assault to burglary to home invasion to corporate wrongdoing — being decided by someone who takes into account only what is legally appropriate. That’s what JWR’s director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, did, and it was for JWR alone to decide if she should interfere with that decision. The PM’s insistence, in the face of this simple proposition, that what really mattered were the jobs of SNC workers, pensioners and suppliers shows his failure to grasp the meaning of prosecutorial independence and the proper separation of powers.”
Globe and Mail editorial board: “If members of a government are free to approach an attorney-general on other criminal cases – not to lobby, but just to, you know, share their thoughts – we are no longer living in a rule-of-law country. Repeatedly providing the attorney-general with “information” and “context” about a how to resolve a case is highly problematic, especially when that “context” is coming from the Prime Ministers’ Office…If the government encouraged the attorney-general to intervene in the case of SNC-Lavalin, then any misunderstanding that resulted was not because of Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s state of mind, but rather the government’s misunderstanding of the law.”
Lorne Gunter, Sun: “Trudeau is a fake feminist. When push comes to shove, Trudeau’s feminist behaviour disappears. Before the recent resignations from his cabinet of two of its most prominent female ministers – Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott – the most famous example of Trudeau’s superficial feminism surrounded his “Kokanee Grope.” Back in 2000, long before he entered politics, Trudeau was attending a music festival in the B.C. Interior and being interviewed by a female reporter who he “inappropriately handled.” When this incident resurfaced last summer, Trudeau’s feminist piety abandoned him. Women never lie about sexual assault (a common feminist mantra) became, for Trudeau, “the same interactions can be experienced very differently” by men and women. This was the same political leader who had Canada’s sexual assault laws changed to severely restrict the ability of an accused man to defend himself in court because Trudeau didn’t like the outcome of the Jian Ghomeshi trial and said his government was going to stand with the victims and their stories. But not, apparently, when that standard applied to him.”
Toronto Sun editorial board: “On Thursday, the PM gave a press conference that was expected to be something of an apology. It was not. It was the defiant golden boy digging in his heels, insistent he had done no wrong. Like Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick before him, he threw Jody Wilson-Raybould under the bus. The fault? An “erosion of trust.” And he made it clear the fault for this erosion was hers. Nobody was buying it. Not the reporters on hand. Not the public, weighing in with frustration on social media.

If the topic is “prosecutorial independence”, should we re-visit the decision to pay Omar Khadr $10M and to pay the other 3 terrorist $30M.

Was that decision made independently, or did the PMO interfere on those ones too. We know there was interference in the Vice Admiral Mark Norman case.

The PPSC managed to somehow be persuaded to go to court on 31 odd charges against Mike Duffy in 2015. Every single charge was tossed out.

“Justice Charles Vaillancourt, right, dismissed all 31 criminal charges against Senator Mike Duffy and condemned members of the Prime Minister’s Office for their actions throughout the whole affair. ”
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mike-duffy-trial-vaillancourt-best-lines-1.3547416

Now, was that gross PPSC prosecutorial incompetence to charge Duffy on 31 baseless charges, or a legacy case where the grossness of harper’s PMO had been used to influence the “independent” service to go to trial in the first place?

Considering the judge’s acid remarks in his verdict, I am of a mind to believe that the harper PMO was behind it all. 31 baseless charge thrown out. And a stern lecture delivered by Judge Vaillancourt on the Con PMO’s behaviour. Still, no tweets about “independence” from the PPSC at the time, so one presumes they went along with it all and were staffed by incompetents if 31 charges were thrown out. Not a one stuck. What were they thinking?

Scheer must have a short and unfilled memory. The very behaviour he is on his high horse about, blaming Trudeau and the PMO in particular, was apparently happily performed by his Con pals just three to four short years ago. And carried to completion if a show trial was what they wanted. But of course, we never get to hear anything about that charade today from Scheer or Raitt. Good Lord, no, it wouldn’t fit the narrative. No, the Cons have metamorphosed in their own minds into blameless wunderkind, blemish-free. As if.

You’ll excuse me if I barf over both Liberals and Conservatives. Got no time for either party, and for my personal purposes both can go hang.

So Harper planned to have a criminal trial going during the election campaign.

Looking at the testimony of Mr. Wernick, I suspect those 2015 charges where more related to the lack of neutrality of the supposedly independent, PPSC .

Interesting how the Liberalanos can try to deflect the heat blowing hard about Duffy. How can you even compare that to the defence of a company that solicitated a third world dictator and his son through prostitutes, booze drugs and monetary embezzlement. All allegedly of course…wink, wink, nod, nod. There will be no jobs lost here, only the money of Trudeau and his friends because as the onion is peeled the bugs inside can’t hide.

526,Warren Kinsella,BOOM: OECD Anti-Bribery group investigating Trudeau government,2019-03-11 09:57:00,Warren,,"Wow.


11/03/2019 – The OECD Working Group on Bribery is concerned by recent allegations of interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin that are subject to proceedings in the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. The Canadian engineering and construction group is the subject of an ongoing prosecution into allegations of the bribery of Libyan officials to obtain a Can$ 58-million contract to restore a water pipeline.

As a Party to the Anti-Bribery Convention, Canada is fully committed to complying with the Convention, which requires prosecutorial independence in foreign bribery cases pursuant to Article 5. In addition, political factors such as a country’s national economic interest and the identity of the alleged perpetrators must not influence foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions.

The OECD Working Group, which brings together the 44 Parties to the Anti-Bribery Convention, will closely monitor Canada’s updates, and has also sent a letter to the Canadian authorities confirming its concerns and next steps in this matter.

What this means: basically, Justin Trudeau, PMO and PCO may have breached Article 5 of the Anti-Bribery Convention of 1997.

This has been decades in the making.

Now it is becoming clear hopefully to more Canadians that supporting/excusing SNC-Lavalin’s vile conduct both overseas and at home degrades our nation’s reputation in the world.

A maple syrup republic.

And for every one of the alleged 9,000 jobs that are at stake should a stake be driven through the black heart of SNC-Lavalin how many more jobs and opportunities will be lost if the LPC continues to conspire with SNC-Lavalin in avoiding justice and ultimately succeeds in doing so?

This doesn’t seem to have been noticed in the news. And what about this part of the article?

“The Federal Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commission opened an investigation into potential violation of Canada’s Conflict of Interest Act, and the Parliamentary Commons Justice Committee initiated a Parliamentary inquiry. The OECD Working Group on Bribery is encouraged by these processes, and notes that the Canadian authorities stress that they are transparent and independent. The Working Group recognises Canada’s willingness to keep it fully informed of developments in the proceedings, including at its next meeting in June 2019.”

If they accept the claim that the Justice circus is “transparent and independent”, that doesn’t sound like they’re really paying attention at all.

I am disgusted by all politics. I literally came back to Warren’s site because of this scandal after years away, having only coming here for anti-hate group info. Because fucking Trump.

Today I emailed my MP, the MP where I am soon moving and Trudeau. I doubt any of them read their own emails. But someone might laugh at their boss being compared to the Lion in the Wizard of Oz, and bog boss Trudeau to Oz himself, the man of all show and no substance. Now I will have to freaking campaign for anyone but the Liberal in my riding.

I guess this is what American’s feel like. Ashamed of their government. It is for no freaking reason too. You sell out the rule of law for nothing? So criminals that deal with the scummiest people on earth with bribes and launderimg money don’t pay the consequenses? Is it for the bank too?

Fuck these fuckers. It is worse if you act like you have values. I am a progressive, Trudeau is worse than Harper. At least Harper said who he was clearly. And shut up the Trump assholes in the Canadian Right. All Trudeau has done is sell out every single group in Canada, with no stand on anything. Demean women and minorities in his new 50/50 cabinet. Harper would be better than Trudeau. And neither party has any real leader to face this dusgusting Trudeau sell out even he rule of law for gangsters… and for nothing?

Sadly, Canada has a long history of signing treaties and the like, with no intention of actually meeting our obligations, as set out in the treaty.

Putting aside the First Nations treaties, most of which were signed prior to Canada formally coming into being (Note to WK – I am not forgiving our trespasses, just not commenting on them specifically):> NATO: obligation to spend 2% of annual GDP on defence, actual Kyoto: aside from Stephan Dion naming his dog after it, no meaningful, tangible action taken
> Paris: lots of virtue signalling, and a soon to be implemented, but ineffective by all economic tests, carbon tax, so no meaningful progress
> Landmines: haven’t laid any in about six decades, so an easy win.

I could go on (and on), but you get my drift.

There is a lack of discussion about motive. What is worth risking his feminist cred, cool cred, aboriginal cred. An old story – follow the money.

This whole scandal is about follow the money. Jobs is an excuse since their projects are sprinkled across the country, not just Quebec.

Follow the money to getting the airports as a cash cow sold from the government to SNC and pension funds that owns a big chunk of it. Follow the trail of clerks from Sabia to Lynch to Wernick to get a DPA.

Sweetheart cash cow and former clerks who know how to work the Ottawa system. That’s the reason for the Liberal DPA desperation.

Warren, since I’m not a lawyer and you are. . . . a few questions seeking your point of view.

I read that SNC is now up on a class action suit for not telling it’s shareholders in Sept (when they first found out), that no DPA being was going to be offered.

What is your understanding of the law regarding their obligation to shareholders in this regard?

Also, if SNC loses this class action. . .then would you expect to see a subsequent investigation and maybe even criminal charges against all those who were complicit with SNC in withholding that information from the shareholders. . .whether they work for SNC, the government. (or both)

524,Warren Kinsella,Ten things Trudeau did wrong at his #LavScam press conference,2019-03-12 07:08:00,Warren,,"How bad was Justin Trudeau’s early-morning LavScam press conference?

So bad CTV Your Morning’s Ben Mulroney asked aloud if the Liberal Prime Minister had made things worse for himself.

So bad Bell Media radio host Evan Solomon called Trudeau’s statement “a word salad.”

So bad I played a tape of Trudeau’s press conference for students in my University of Calgary Faculty of Law crisis communications course – as a sterling example of how not to do crisis communications.

Trudeau made many mistakes in Parliament’s press theatre. Here are ten.

1. He didn’t apologize. After Trudeau’s office leaked that the beleaguered Liberal leader was deliberating about an apology for the SNC-Lavalin scandal, we all kind of expected one. We didn’t get one. And when Trudeau was asked why, he blinked and stammered and looked offended. Dumb. Apologies cost nothing, Petit Justin. But if done right, they pay many dividends.

2. He didn’t take responsibility. Even if you don’t apologize – even if you don’t express the smallest amount of regret, which Trudeau didn’t do either – it’s important that you accept that the proverbial buck stops with you. Trudeau (again) said that it’s all Jody Wilson-Raybould’s fault. “She didn’t come to me,” he wheezed. Well, actually, she did. You just wouldn’t listen.

3. He didn’t sound sincere. Justin Trudeau’s greatest strength is his acting ability. He is an expert at radiating wet-eyed sincerity and emotion – kind of like our Labrador retrievers, when we come home and discover they’ve eaten an entire living room sofa. At his press conference, Trudeau had all the conviction of an ISIS hostage reading a statement prepared by his captors. This was a truly historic moment, and Trudeau needed to convince us. He didn’t.

4. He didn’t acknowledge the seriousness of this scandal. LavScam is a raging five-alarm fire; Trudeau brought a squirt gun to the blaze. He did and said nothing that will extinguish Canadians’ growing belief that Trudeau and his staff may have obstructed justice.

5. He didn’t rebut the allegations that have been made against him. In fact, he did the precise reverse. Trudeau confirmed all of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s evidence: that she was pressured to give a sleazy Quebec company a sweetheart deal. That he and his officials – 11 of them, more than 20 times, over a four-month period in Fall 2018 – did what the former Attorney-General said they did. Guilty as charged.

6. He didn’t make us feel he understands it. In fact, Trudeau gave us every indication that the pressure is getting to him. At one point, the Deflector-in-Chief looked up from his focus-grouped talking points and launched into a bizarre exposition about his dead father. Pro tip: hauling dead relatives out of the crypt to buttress your argument isn’t convincing. It’s creepy.

7. He didn’t provide a compelling narrative. People get bombarded by millions of words and images every day. It’s data smog; it’s hard to keep up. So, it’s critical that you provide a narrative – a story. (Because while facts tell, stories sell.) At the conclusion of Trudeau’s windy word salad, we still didn’t know why he fired Jody Wilson-Raybould. Because she didn’t speak French? Because she was “difficult”? Because Scott Brison? We don’t know.

8. He didn’t sound like a Prime Minister. Sure, he used an official-looking podium. Sure, there was a battery of Canadian flags arrayed behind him. Sure, he can wear a pricey suit. But, with the sound off, Trudeau looked like he was irritated that he was being forced to answer tricky questions from the wretches in the Press Gallery. He looked like he was pissed off. Not penitent.

9. He didn’t get it. The seriousness of it all, that is. Over and over, Trudeau gave us every indication that the whole mess was simply a case of broken telephone. When, in fact, it was about how he and his senior staff – not one of them a lawyer – repeatedly tried to tell the lawyers what to do. The decision was all Wilson-Raybould’s, he said – as long as, you know, she made the decision he wanted her to make.

10. He didn’t remember the cardinal comms rule. Which is: don’t repeat the main allegation against you. Instead, Justin Trudeau acknowledged, over and over, that there had been “an erosion of trust” between him and his former Attorney-General. He said it so much, even the New York Times put it in a big headline.

No, Justin, the “erosion of trust” wasn’t between you and Jody Wilson-Raybould.

But its not like you needed my opinion.
More of my opinion (that you likely already have guessed) is that it appears the PM is employing a strategy of plausible denial (fooling enough people all the time).

I like the top ten list. But as a non-partisian Canadian with strong values the biggest issue is the betrayal of the fundamental value and basis for our country.

We follow rule of law. Peace, Order, Good Government. We write Constitutions. Remember 1982? We export our legal systems and constitutional experts as much as wheat or oil or hockey. It is the point of the country.

My ex clerked at the Supreme Court. I know the lawyers that work at Info Comm and Privacy, I know what all the other law clerks, and justices are like. They all would fucking resign if the PMO tried to pressure them to screw with a legitimate, very important criminal matter.

This is the worst scandal in Canadian History. This is a betrayal of everything. In 2019, when there is both mo excuse, and as Fascism ravages America and threatens a bunch of the world, the fucking Prime Minister betrays the most fundamental Canadian value? Rule of Law… for criminals and gangsters and dictators. For nothing. At least we needed a National Railway or to deal with the Referendum. We need to protect people that bribe and launder money because some made up “jobs” bullshit.

Fuck you Trudeau. You shit all over the living room. Then your response is “chicks gonna chick!” Women… they stuck together. Yeah. Those 2 did… because they have integrity, and without the highest respect forthe rule of law, we aren’t a middle power, have no world authority, and no respect from the world. We are just another shit bag country.

I want to be proud of being a Canadian. Not ashamed. We have made mistakes as a nation. This one was pointless, so idiotic in 2019 and for nothing.

That is my reason. Over your 10. If you do what Trudeau has done. Why bother even having a Canada? Why have a Constitution or laws or rules? Fascism creeps around the world as the biggest threat since early in the cold war. In my lifetime this is a bigger threat than the cold war was from 1975-1990. America is fucking almost half Nazi and they in charge. And Trudeau wants to act like a fascist? Fuck him. He needs out of office, and to live in shame as a failure and essentially a traitor to Canadian values.

This is bigger than sexism and bigotry over native people. This is a betrayal of every Canadian that has lived and died since 1867. Every soldier. Every lawyer and teacher and scholar and student and politician. Everyone.

I know most might not see it that way. I do. It is black and white. Again… to accomplish nothing, then doubling down again and again. I guess Narcissim is the same. Trump is way more evil and deranged, but Trudeau is similarily delusional. What mountain was he born on top of? Oh… the fucking PM that had our fucking Comstitution created?!?! What a moron. How can he be this out of touch? What is wrong with him?

It seems that many are buying Justin’s blather, and attempts to use reason and facts are ignored. In some cases, it may be based on the cynical calculation that the Conservatives are worse, so they will be loyal to JT, regardless of private misgivings. In other cases, unfortunately, they seem to actually believe it. Many Canadians are conformist and have no value system beyond that. They are incapable of independent thought. They see following the leader as the highest quality, and anyone who asks uncomfortable questions is a troublemaker to be shunned and destroyed. This ties in to the idea that Canada is a fundamentally good country, and if you rock the boat, you’re therefore a bad person. This is a fascist mentality. I feel that Canada has been going down the wrong path for some time now. Canada used to be a global leader in many areas, and is now quite middle of the pack. We are an increasingly mediocre society. I suspect that Justin is going to get away with this, unless there are further developments.

I’m not typically a tinfoil-wearer, but the PM’s handling of this has got me scratching my head. Even putting aside the ethical dodginess–certainly, there’s at least an argument for obstruction–itself, think of the damage he’s been willing to sustain on this file:1) He’s shredded his credibility at home and abroad;
2) He’s utterly destroyed his brand as the woke, transparent, reconciliation-seeking, gender-equity PM;
3) He’s lost his best friend and top advisor;
4) He’s made a laughing-stock of the Clerk of the Privy Council;
5) He’s sown division in his cabinet, his caucus, and his party at large;
6) He’s forfeit a healthy lead in the polls and looks poised now to lose the next election;
7) He’s lost two seriously important, competent, & credible female cabinet ministers;
8) He’s raised the temperature on regional animosity in the nation.

All this, and he’s not simply still insisting that he’s done nothing wrong; more than that, he’s leaving the possibility of a DPA for a profoundly suspect, much-charged, -investigated, and -convicted (though in the last 3 years also much-favoured) corporation, on the table and seeking to defend doing so.

This is so bizarre as to lead me to ask, and to ask why others are not asking, just what does SNC-Lavalin have on Justin Trudeau?

Warren,

Your top 10 list of PMJT’s press conference screw-ups is a bit harsh, don’tcha think? Consider who we are remonstrating …

Given PMJT’s Marxist/Jesuit upbringing, compounded by some good, old-fashioned MK-Ultra-ing, plus never interacting with anyone who doesn’t exhibit some extreme psychopathy …. is it any wonder that the concept of right and wrong is lost on him? And if Trudeau were ever to be deprived his Laurentian mafia Rolodex and papa’s notebook, he’d barely be capable of making shit out of bread. If clues were shoes, he’d be barefoot.

It’s fitting that Trudeau was drawn to acting; it enables him to portray himself as anything but the real Justin. Everything he does or says is a form of portrayal and/or deflection; typical defense mechanisms for anyone who’s been severely abused.

PMJT is a terrible actor. And here he is hoping to give Canadians another 4 seasons of the worst rated series ever in Canadian entertainment. Can’t the network just cancel the “Justin Boils the Frog- Canada’s Demise” political drama/comedy series, tout de suite? He couldn’t foresee that so many members of his cast would be improvising and ad-libbing. They apparently never got a copy of the series script.

PMJT, up until a year ago, was one of the most “useful idiots” being used by the Fabian Socialists to champion their new world order utopia wet dream (UN 2030 Agenda). Now that so many are off-script, including himself, PMJT has become the most “useless idiot”.

Comms can’t. #LavScam is beyond comms help. Trudeau now needs todo things, not say things.

Here’s the five things he needs to do.
Call in the cops on his own government. Chretien did that in sponsorship. It’s not the action of someone who is guilty.
Call for an external body, like the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group, to investigate, too. That’ll address the conspiracy theorists who’ll say the RCMP are beholden to Trudeau.
Flush the Clerk of the Privy Council. Wernick’s statements – there’ll be “assassinations,” “vomitorium,” etc. – have been crazy and inflammatory. He’s made a bad situation way worse. Fire him.
Fire Katie Telford, Mathieu Bouchard, Elder Marques, Ben Chin and any other senior staffer who was pushing Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a sweetheart deal to a sleazy Quebec company – and any staffer who has facilitated a cover-up. Try and bring back Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to cabinet (they’ll refuse, however).
Call an election now. Say that Parliament is too divided (true) and has lost confidence in the government (really true). Say the Liberals need a new mandate to get past this unholy mess.

He won’t do any of those things, of course. Nor will he do the one thing that will really end this scandal.

It doesn’t matter who’s running the show in the House of Chuckles. Regardless, SNC-Lavalin will get their remediation agreement plus, as part of the bonus round, a revised “integrity regime”. SNC-Lavalin are an integral part of the Laurentian mafia running this business enterprise called Canada.

Indeed, if Lametti countermands the current DPP decision regarding #LavScam, the socialists who call themselves Liberals will be the worse for it. My point is that neither Andrew Scheer nor Jagmeet Singh would rescind Lametti’s granting of the DPA.

Agree with all although somewhat neutral on #5. He could call one now but won’t as he hopes during the summer recess people forget about it and poll numbers rebound. Also Alberta has an election this spring so if he does call one he needs to coordinate it with Notley to ensure they don’t overlap. Yes Liberals will be lucky if they hold onto any of the seats they have in Alberta and true for Tory MPs in Alberta they would rather have them out stumping for the UCP than in BC or Ontario helping Tory candidates in vulnerable Liberal held ridings (since most Alberta ridings are solid Tory, I suspect you will see a lot of them campaigning elsewhere in the country), but still as a courtesy you don’t have elections overlap with provincial or municipal. That being said doesn’t matter as Trudeau won’t be calling one early.

They don’t need to be out stumping for the UCP. They’re going to win, and big. Also, mark your calendar for April 29 or May 6 for a PEI election. I assume JT and Wade MacLaughlan talked about it when they talked last week here in Charlottetown. Yet another provincial Liberal government that may go down in flames. If an election is early, mark it for mid-June. Before the Norman trial.

PEI might go Green who are leading in the polls which would be a first. Newfoundland will also have one this year but I believe that is pushed back to November. As for early election call, June would be a horrible time as Trudeau winning relies heavily on a strong millennial turnout and when away in the summer turnout amongst that group will definitely be lower whereas older voters will always vote no matter what.

522,Warren Kinsella,In today’s Sun! Trudeau’s train-wreck #LavScam press conference,2019-03-13 07:42:00,Warren,,"It was vintage Justin Trudeau.

There he stood at the prime ministerial podium at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa, a battery of Canadian flags behind him, a throng of journalists in front of him. He blinked, all dewy-eyed sincerity.

It was Thursday morning, early. He’d just been asked if he planned to apologize for the metastasizing Lavscam scandal. It wasn’t a crazy question: Trudeau’s own press minions had been leaking that the prime minister was considering doing precisely that.

But, no. Said Trudeau: “I will be making an Inuit apology later today,” he said. Blink, blink.

And so it went. Not the worst press encounter of the week — R. Kelly won that prize, hands down — but close. Made a bad situation way, way worse.

Here’s why.

For starters, as noted, the Liberal leader didn’t apologize — for what he had done to Jody Wilson-Raybould. For trying to cook up a sweetheart deal for a rotten Quebec engineering firm. For wiping his feet on the rule of law.

Apologies cost nothing, Justin. If done right, they pay lots of dividends.

That’s not all: The Deflector-in-Chief didn’t take responsibility. Not even a bit.

Even if you don’t apologize, Justin — even if you don’t express the smallest amount of regret, which you didn’t do either — it’s important that you accept that the proverbial buck stops with you. Instead, you whinged (yet again) that it’s all Wilson-Raybould’s fault.

“She didn’t come to me,” you wheezed. (Actually, she did. You just wouldn’t listen.)

The worst of it: Trudeau sounded as sincere as a two-bit carnival barker.

That’s a surprise. Trudeau’s greatest talent, you see, is acting. He is an expert at radiating sincerity and emotion. But at his press conference, he had all the conviction of an al-Qaida hostage reading a statement about the evils of the West. This was a historic moment, and Trudeau needed to convince us. He didn’t.

He didn’t acknowledge the seriousness of this scandal, either. Lavscam is a raging five-alarm fire; Trudeau brought a squirt gun. He said nothing that will extinguish Canadians’ growing belief that Trudeau and his staff may have obstructed justice.

Also: Trudeau didn’t rebut the allegations that have been made against him. In fact, he did the reverse. He confirmed all of Wilson-Raybould’s evidence: That she was pressured to give SNC-Lavalin a judicial high-five. That he and his officials — 11 of them, more than 20 times, over a four-month period in fall 2018 — did what the former attorney general said they did. Guilty as charged, Your Honour.

At one point, Trudeau looked up from his focus-grouped talking points. He looked a bit weepy. Was an apology about to arrive?

Nope.

Instead, Trudeau gave us every indication that the pressure is getting to him. Without warning, he launched into a bizarre exposition about his dead father. How he and Pierre liked justice. And stuff.

Pro tip, Justin: Hauling dead relatives out of the crypt to buttress your argument isn’t convincing. It’s creepy.

And so it went. Trudeau just didn’t get how bad this is. You know: That, in a functioning democracy, politicians cannot ever, ever tell judges and prosecutors what to do. When that happens enough, you are a democracy no more. You’re a banana republic.

As he departed to “make an Inuit apology,” he was right about one thing, however. An “erosion of trust” had happened, as he said.

But the “erosion of trust” wasn’t between him and Wilson-Raybould.

It’s between him and us","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Trudeau is lacking in so many areas: diplomacy, depth of knowledge, listening skills, tact, preparedness, work ethic, empathy, sincerity, honesty, conflict resolution, anger management, interpersonal relationships, copping skills, and much more.

He was never ready, and still isn’t. The ceremonial prime minister experiment has gone tragically wrong and with Butts marginalized, we begin to see just how wrong. We are leaderless, adrift, and derelict.

Curious as to what can be read into the recent departure of Ethics Comissioner Mario Dion for extended and indefinite medical leave. Trudeau refuses to apologize knowing he can get Dion to run out the clock on the ethics enquiry while simultaneously getting the Justice Committee to say that additional testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould would serve no further purpose, in the hopes of weathering the storm?

He is not a patriotic Canadian. He is a lost Narcissist that thinks the world begins and ends with him. He can’t care about 36 million others, he is still a child living a life with a detached much older father and growing up in essentially a “royal family” with a mother who was lost herself.

I don’t think he is pure evil like Trump, but he is not a fully formed human being. He is a child that wants to impress everyone, every one… and anyone, all that matters is him getting a pat on the head and getting told he is a good, smart boy.

Really that is his life. The public and Liberals and voters are responsible for bringing a talking Handsome Ken Doll to power. He might as well have a pull string for Ken to repeat empty platitides he does not even comprehend.

As this death spiral continues we will see more and more of this aspect of Justin Trudeau. Compared to Chretien or Martin or Harper he is a joke. He is not even the one really in power or making the decisions. He is a Ronald Reagan like figurehead, no nothing actor, that fails to realize that is his actual role in his own government.

We need him gone from Canadian Political life. He is as cancerous to Canada as the Ford’s are. We need a fuckimg “adult” to lead this country. Not a lost “Prince” that has never grown up or had to realize that you can’t serve every master and please everyone. As angry as I am at Trudeau now… I feel a mix of pity and sadness at hiw empty and broken a human he is. Because as evil as all this shit wuth SNC is… and that quite possibly the actual people in charge are corrupt personally. Trudeau has literally as much of a clue as Trump does, or my dog. I mean my dog loves everyone. He will cuddle and lick and wag his tale for everyone and anyone. No decernment or judgement by my dog… or Justin. Trudeau is now as obviously not capable of being Prime Minister as Trump is. Without all the pure evil. A lost boy or deer in the headlights of an oncoming train. And Trudeau, in that situation would try to tell the train how important the train is to Canada. How the train will be in the cabinet with the airplane and transport and that train values are Canadian values… until he is run over 10 seconds later.

As I hate politics more and more… I really want me some Joe Clark and Chretien and Broadbent and Layton. And really the two cabinet members who resigned. They all were flawed but… they stood for something and I coukd at least respect them. This shit is pathetic. And it is on the voters and media who made some handsome prince with maybe a 110 IQ and no experience not being part of basically a royal family into the highest office.

We are the fools for choosing this fool, and keeping him in office as he acts like a fool.

Justin definitely seems like a narcissist, but you’re making a mistake in falling for his little boy lost, Peter Pan persona. That type of narcissist is as dangerous as any other, perhaps more so, because people often have sympathy for them due to their childlike presentation. They are just as malicious and vindictive as any other malignant narcissist against anyone whom they see as a threat. The treatment of JWR has been a textbook narcissistic attack – smears, diversions, gaslighting, DARVO, word salad, “flying monkeys” and so on.

Warren, some good PR for you in this Georgia Strait piece.

Devilish advice for Justin Trudeau during his most trying time as prime minister
The Georgia Straight
Tuesday, March 12, 2019

By Charlie Smith
Right-wing bloggers love to portray Justin Trudeau as the devil, but he’s actually a nice Catholic boy with the best of intentions.
He loves his wife. He loves his children. And he truly believes that there’s strength in diversity.
But like all of us, Trudeau slips up from time to time. And never so badly as when he and the fixers in his office thought that it was a good idea to try to prevent SNC-Lavalin from being convicted of a criminal offence.
But even a good Catholic can give in to temptation if the stakes are high enough.
And with his prime minister’s position on the line, the Straight has learned that he’s been consulting with the devil himself for political advice.
An unnamed source in Hell has provided us with the transcript of one of these conversations. You can read it below.
Justin: I know I’m not supposed to talk to you, but I’m truly fucked right now because of the Globe and Mail. Any advice?
Lucifer: You could quit.
Justin: I’m not a quitter. Besides, that would give that twerp Scheer just what he wants.
Lucifer: So you want me to save your ass?
Justin: Uh, yes.
Lucifer: Are you prepared to listen to what I say?
Justin: Yes
Lucifer: You’re a fucking idiot.
Justin: What are you talking about? I’m the prime minister of Canada!
Lucifer: So far, you’ve done everything wrong. The maximum shelf life of any major news story should be no more than three weeks. Even the clamouring over the death of Prince Diana pretty much ended after three weeks. This is the fifth week of SNC-Lavalin leading the news. You’re in so deep you’ll need an excavation crew to get you out. I’m tempted to call in those dive teams who got those Thai kids out of that cave.
Justin: If you’re so smart, tell me what I’ve done wrong.
Lucifer: First off, you thought you were so powerful that you didn’t need to suck up to the Canadian media. You gave everything to Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and the CBC. You thought that by pandering to the digital giants, it would help you in trade talks with Trump. But that totally destroyed the Globe and Mail, CTV, the Toronto Star, Postmedia, and Global-as well as its owners, the Shaw family. They’re never going to drop the SNC-Lavalin story now.
Justin: What are you talking about? Morneau is handing over $600 million to those bastards.
Lucifer: That’s chump change to Thomson and Godfrey. And it’s over five years, for fuck sakes. They smell weakness, just like they did when you went to India. This is their opportunity to get Scheer elected.
Justin: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Lucifer: David Thomson might be the richest man in Canada, but he’s seriously ticked over the amount of money he’s losing on the Globe. But he can’t sell it because he’ll look like a doofus to all those people who thought his dad was a great newspaper proprietor.
Justin: What about Godfrey?
Lucifer: He’s so pissed that his newspapers have to compete with CBC for digital ads. And Scheer has promised to privatize the CBC. You never think about these things, do you? You’re such a moron sometimes. Chrétien had Kinsella in his office-he understood media. Who have you relied on? Gardner? Jesus Murphy.
Justin: What’s wrong with Gardner?
Lucifer: He thinks he’s a goddamned professor. No wonder you’re so fucked. Kinsella was a streetfighter. He would have gotten you out of this situation by turning the attention on Scheer. But you were too pure to rely on his advice. Everyone in Ottawa knows you have trust issues with anyone born before 1970, except for Morneau and Goodale. The Globe stuck it to you because you made it so easy. If Fife could take down Stephen Harper over the Duffy scandal, you were going to be a piece of cake.
Justin: Why me?
Lucifer: Fife’s bosses hate you because you kissed Zuckerberg’s ass. You kissed Google’s ass. You kissed Netflix’s ass. Evan Solomon’s bosses hate you for the same reason. And that Mercedes Stephenson is a secret right winger. Global was glad when Vassy bolted for CBC. It put someone from Calgary in the driver’s seat.
Justin: How did I get into this mess with the media?
Lucifer: Hedy Fry showed you a way out but you ignored her. The heritage committee gave you the blueprint. She’s won eight goddamned elections.
Justin: Is this why the Globe keeps nailing me?
Lucifer: It’s not the only reason. The newsroom is filled with libertarians. I’ll let you in on something, though. Crawley, the publisher, was hooting when he saw the print edition on February 7 detailing what you did to Wilson-Raybould. He quipped “just not ready”. Justin Trudeau has been making all the wrong moves as he tries to dig himself out of political trouble over SNC-Lavalin.
Justin: Okay, I get it. I need to improve on media relations. What else?
Lucifer: Your third-party endorsers are, for the most part, a disaster. Jonathan Wilkinson? Good god, nobody even knows who he is. He looks like the type of guy who would shut down a GM plant. Sheila Copps? Why did you bring out that old retread? Did you seriously think she was going to influence anyone by trashing Jody Wilson-Raybould? It’s made her a martyr. But the worst is Christy Clark. By far. I can’t imagine what made you think she would help your cause. Just because she’s a woman isn’t going to help you with female voters, especially in B.C. You’re so sophomoric, Justin.
Justin: Are any my endorsers working for me?
Lucifer: Carla Qualtrough’s okay. She’s got this sexy librarian look that works on TV and she has a brain. Men like her and women like her. But nobody really knows who the hell she is. Plus, she’s going to get slaughtered in the next election. Garneau isn’t bad, either. But the reality is that you have to aim far higher.
Justin: Who should be speaking up for me?
Lucifer: You need A-listers. People with a reputation for integrity. Paul Martin. Bob Rae. Sheila Fraser. Kevin Page. Jody found herself a Supreme Court judge and she’s got Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond in her camp. Plus the most respected Indigenous leaders in the country. Who have you got? Sheila Copps on the line from Mexico. Game, set, and match.
Justin: Rae won’t help me. He’s still pissed because I wouldn’t tell him that I was planning on seeking the Liberal leadership when he was interim leader.
Lucifer: Come to think of it, you really did stab him in the back. He could have been prime minister. Page and Fraser won’t help you, either. But Martin might.
Justin: I was thinking that maybe Ryan Reynolds or Michael Bublé could be of assistance.
Lucifer: Don’t be a dunce. That will just get you ridiculed on Saturday Night Live. Play to your strengths. Get photographed with icons in different ethnic communities. Herb Dhaliwal. Patrick Chan. People like that. You’ll show up in the Chinese and Indian media outlets and it might prevent more of your MPs from pulling a Jane Philpott on you.
Justin: You have far better advice than Gerry Butts ever gave me. What else should I know?
Lucifer: You really chose a stupid cabinet. I figured that you and Gerry picked some people based on how they look on TV. That might have worked for a couple of weeks in 2015 but what did you get in the end? Morneau? Monsef? O’Regan? McKenna? Joly? Kent Hehr? I’ve never seen this many featherweights in a federal cabinet since your dad was prime minister.
Justin: Gerry, Katie, and Wernick told me that if I put rookies in, it would make it easier to control things from the centre.
Lucifer: That works only if the centre has a brain. But Wernick is too stupid for words. Who the fuck goes before a parliamentary committee and tries to change the subject by talking about political assassinations? It would be laughable if it wasn’t so pathetic. By the way, you’ve got to fire Wernick if you want this scandal to die down. The public wants a corpse and for you to show that you realize what you did was wrong.
Justin: But Wernick is there to help me give the corporations what they want with Indigenous people. These companies need access to resources. That was my two-pronged strategy. Gerry and I dreamed this up back in 2011 when we were meeting with Manley and Carr. Put an Indigenous person in a high-profile cabinet post. Talk a good game about this being the most important relationship. But make certain that corporations have access to resources to keep the stock market up and ensure the Canada Pension Plan makes a good return. It was working perfectly until Jody started raising hell about SNC-Lavalin.
Lucifer: Yeah, but Jody is smart. She put two and two together and realized that when you bought the Trans Mountain pipeline system, it was about giving more work to SNC-Lavalin.
Justin: Who should I have put in cabinet?
Lucifer: David McGuinty. Judy Sgro. Wayne Easter. Arif Virani. Joyce Murray. Adam Vaughan. Anthony Housefather. I could give you more names if you like.
Justin: No. That’s enough. Where do I go from here?
Lucifer: Read Martyn Brown’s column on Straight.com. He knows what he’s talking about. He says you have to bring Wilson-Raybould back into cabinet as the attorney general. It’s the only way people will trust you.
Justin: Who is Martyn Brown? Never heard of him.
Lucifer: He only managed to get Gordon Campbell elected three times as B.C. premier. One of them was the biggest landslide in Canadian history. But of course, I recognize that you’re not a big reader-and Brown’s articles sometimes run for 6,000 or even 10,000 words. But pay attention to what he’s saying. It just might help you keep your job.
Justin: I don’t have time to read. Give me the Coles Notes version.
Lucifer: You have to say you’re sorry. You have to admit you made a mistake by interfering in a criminal prosecution. You have to let Jody Wilson-Raybould tell the whole truth to the justice committee. Otherwise, you’re toast.
Justin: I think I can win the next election without doing that. There was no inappropriate pressure put on Wilson-Raybould. That’s our line and we’re sticking with it. Besides, Scheer and Jagmeet Singh don’t have a chance against me.
Lucifer: You just don’t get it. First you said the Globe story was false. Then your flunkies admitted it was true to the justice committee. As this story stays in the news, more of your MPs will start criticizing you because it’s the only way they’ll be able to keep their seats. Say you’re sorry and promise to never give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.
Justin: I’ll never do that. And I’ll never fire Wernick.
Lucifer: (Sigh) Get me a Tylenol.

Interesting, but who would she cross to? She seems to be left-centrist, and probably not willing to be part of either NDP or CPC policies. Even if she is semi-NDP-ish, she surely would see the career abyss that would send her into.

I predict that she will remain in the LPC, and bide her time until Trudeau self-destructs. She will then be there to pick up the pieces.

contraire Warren. This is not political stupidity. It is a majority government looking into the electoral abyss. Clearly they’ve come to realize that they have a better chance of surviving by facing the backlash in response to such a blatant, partisan political maneuverer is preferable – and their political calculus tells them – versus calling other witnesses and calling back Jody Wilson-Raybould. They deem the later to seal their fate come election time and/or to result in Justin being shamed into resigning. Better to shut down the (non)justice committee, bring in a budget, and if necessary – call an early election. ANYTHING, rather than more testimony. The Justin-led Liberals are flying the Crisis Management plane without any landing gear.

Jim R says:

What would be the rationale for an early election? We’re supposed to have one on Oct 17, and there’s certainly no national emergency, or anything even close, to warrant not honouring that date. This would look like pure partisan manipulation of the election date, which can’t be good.

Reply


Vancouverois says: 

March 13, 2019 at 10:09 pm

On the other hand, it may be to the Liberals’ advantage to hold the election before the Norman trial begins in August. The stuff that’s going to come out in the testimony may be damaging enough that they’re willing to take a hit for calling the election early.

I suppose they might also call it over the SNC-Lavalin scandal, as the Suburban article above suggests. But that would bring it to the forefront of public attention, which is the one thing they’ve been trying to avoid at all costs. It does look like their strategy overall is just to say “jobs!” and brazen it out… but I don’t think that would be a good strategy for them. There’s brazen, and then there’s BRAZEN.

This, I think, has gone from poorly managed to scary. Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion gone indefinitely, and the Justice committee shut down within 24 hours. What next? Lametti gives SNC its DPA, and we get another arrogant word-salad press conference from Trudeau about how it was all about the jobs?

I’m concerned what we are witnessing isn’t just the poor management of a favour for the old-boys network gone wrong, but we are witnessing a government that no longer cares about democratic process and the rule of law. Moves like the shut-down of the justice committee and the “extended medical leave” of the ethics commissioner I’d expect in places like Venezuela or Syria, but not Canada.

This is a government that no longer cares about how it is perceived by Canadians and will do whatever they need to do to hold onto power. Wouldn’t be surprised if we soon see moves by Trudeau to somehow tip the election format in favour of the Liberals before the October. He did reneg on his promise of electoral reform….

The RCMP needs to get involved NOW. This has gone from bad to disgusting.

Even given all the recent instances of Liberals doing and saying stupid things over this issue, there’s no way they could possibly be *that* dumb. It would be political suicide to even attempt to give SNC-Lavalin a DPA now, and they know it.

Reply


Shane says: 

March 13, 2019 at 9:24 pm

You, I and the rest of Canada know it, but Lametti still hasn’t come out and clearly ruled out a DPA. Lametti has also taken the step of seeking outside legal advice on the matter which Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured to do, but refused. My guess is that in the PMOs office the DPA is still on the table, that Lametti is looking to get some form of legal justification for it, and the plan was to push it through after the initial storm blew over, and the timing was seen as better. All about the jobs after all… Much harder to do now. After the last few days though there isn’t much in the way of arrogance or stupidity that I’d put past this government.

Witnessing the jaw-dropping events at the ‘Justice’ Committee, this morning, I see a measure of desperation creeping into this affair that is very alarming. Desperation knows no bounds. The words “I’m worried that somebody’s going to get shot ……”, regarded as over-the-top when first spoken, may yet prove to be prophetic.

519,Warren Kinsella,Your morning #LavScam: March 14 edition,2019-03-14 08:53:00,Warren,,"The Liberal majority on the “Justice” Committee again voted to prevent Jody Wilson-Raybould from speaking.

It didn’t go over well. None of it has gone over well.

•Toronto Sun Campaign Research poll: “As for Trudeau himself, Yufest says he now stands at just 29% approval compared to 58% who think the PM is doing a bad job. Those numbers says Yufest are close to the unpopularity of former Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne who dropped into the 20s and was never able to recover.

•Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail: “Too bad for their party that [Trudeau Liberals] can’t figure out how to rip the Band-Aid off as quickly on the larger SNC-Lavalin affair. Instead, they are fuelling the most potent narrative still giving legs to the story – the idea that they are blocking Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney-general, from revealing something important about the SNC-Lavalin affair…The Liberals say they prefer to discuss such things behind closed doors.But in this case, that’s a crock. This was a simple motion in the most closely watched parliamentary hearings in the country. It was a simple yes or no question.

•Lawrence Martin, Globe: “Let’s reject Gerald Butts’s claim in his committee testimony that the Prime Minister’s Office did not pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin case. Let’s reject his view that her cabinet demotion had nothing to do with her unwillingness to co-operate on the file. Instead, let’s accept Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events and conclude that she showed courage, not spite; that she stood for high principle, and performed a noble public service….But on the matter of loyalty, a woman from the Indigenous community presents a new dynamic. How different is the loyalty concept to a community betrayed so often through the country’s history? It’s been a community that has stood apart, has been made to feel apart and is apart. That Ms. Wilson-Raybould reacted the way she did should not have come as a surprise to Mr. Trudeau. Her people, with good reason, were never really part of the team. As the Prime Minister is ruefully finding out, they still aren’t.”

•Campbell Clark, Globe: “This seems like a pretty self-destructive thing for Liberal MPs to do. It adds fuel to the story, and the same question – whether they will let Ms. Wilson-Raybould come back to the committee to testify again – will come up again next Tuesday. Those Canadians who figured they already knew pretty much what happened in this affair are being invited to ask questions again.”

•Konrad Yakabuski, Globe: “The brutality of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s regime has been cited by some legal experts as a possible explanation for why Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel refused to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin. The law forbids Ms. Roussel from entering into such an agreement if she believes a company’s alleged crimes might have caused serious bodily harm or death….SNC-Lavalin had been operating in Libya since the mid-1990s. But its business there took off after [Paul] Martin’s trip. In a 2006 Globe and Mail interview, then-SNC-Lavalin CEO Jacques Lamarre insisted the company was helping to elevate business practices in Libya: “We like win-win situations. We’ve been involved in international markets for over 40 years and have helped many countries to become normal.” By 2011, as Mr. Gadhafi moved to suppress Arab Spring protests in his country, it had become clear the dictator had never given up on repression. SNC-Lavalin found itself having to publicly defend its $275-million contract to build a state-run prison.”

•John Ibbitson, Globe: “[The LavScam] affair damaged as well Mr. Trudeau’s reputation abroad. News organizations around the world have reported on the controversy, with “charismatic Trudeau tarnished by scandal” a common refrain. And this week’s statement by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development was devastating. “The OECD Working Group on Bribery is concerned by recent allegations of interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin,” the statement read, adding that, under the terms of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention that Canada belongs to, “political factors such as a country’s national economic interest and the identity of the alleged perpetrators must not influence foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions.” To anyone who has been arguing that this controversy was manufactured by febrile media feeding off the actions of misguided or disloyal MPs: The OECD disagrees.”

Dave Fuller, I agree. I think that the Canadian media give Minister Freeland a free pass because she once carried a press card. Nothing I have seen to date has given me any reason to give her much more than a passing grade, but only when using a Bell Curve that is comprised of one of the most underwhelming cabinets in the last four decades.

In my mind CF disqualifies herself. The SNC scandal should have reminded her of her own words:“I think there are two related megaproblems in the world right now. The first problem is that the rules-based order is under more strain than any time since it was invented after World War II. The other very related issue is authoritarianism is starting to make gains on democracy. They’re not the same thing. The second is as much about domestic policy as it is about international politics.”

A thought occurred to me regarding some advice for the LPC and the PMO. They could hire some liberal “All Stars” – perhaps Sheila Copps and Kathleen Wynne. Sheila and Kathleen could tour Canada and explain to us Canadians why we are too dumb to understand that LavScam is no big deal – a tempest in a teapot. Meanwhile, Justin can stay in Ottawa (or continue his vacation in Florida), wear nice suits and seek out photo ops. Just a thought for the PMO to consider. And…, if the polls don’t show this working, perhaps Justin can try his “tie loosened, sleeves rolled up” look.

Perhaps she, as well, was subjected to pressure.

There were many repercussions after the “flare” she put out against Saudi Arabia, last August. SNC-Lav was cut off from that country’s oil industry as a major income source, is the one to consider, here.

SNCl-Lav, already suffering from previous losses, would probably want to make an effort to reduce further financial bleeding by appealing to the ones that could make it stop (either by making up with Saudi Arabia, or by forcing a DPA so they could continue to “bid” on Canadian Federal project contracts). Perhaps the Liberals made a choice: Holding the stance against the Saudis and helping SNC-Lav with their domestic case – a “win / win” situation, someone may have thought – or bowing to the Saudis on human rights. By September, according to Wilson-Raybould, the first of the interactions to influence her had begun.

Of course, the PMO would want Freeland to appear to support them in their misguided quest. Perhaps her position was also threatened if she did not toe the party line (with the rationale that she was “partly responsible” for the situation). She may have other motivations for taking her current posture; these things tend to become apparent, given enough time.

It does seem, however, she has done much more than “toe the line”, here.

Warren, I am huge fan of yours, but more than a dozen Muslims were just killed in a mosque in New Zealand,and Andrew Scheer didn’t mention their faith or their place of worship in his statement — just a bland “all lives matter” condemnation.

We need to get to the bottom of Lavscanner, but not at the risk of another Islamophobic PM. Maybe you could pause for a week or two on this issue? Or until Leader Scheer condemns Islamophobia?

or should we expect something even more interesting on the 19th (overshadowing the budget, and of course the reconvening of the Faux Justice Committee)?

Early election, or is it something perhaps even more damaging to the Trudeau brand?

Considering the ongoing machinations of the McGill “Happy Gang”, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to expect what comes next.

Those NDP numbers are truly dismal. If they can’t even crack double digits I don’t see how they avoid a total wipeout in Quebec. We have to go back to 2006 to find NDP numbers this low in Quebec, and they didn’t win a single seat. Even winning 12.5% of the vote in 2008 only netted them a single seat (Mulcair in Outremont).

Lib 35% CPC 26% doesn’t seem that shocking. Libs down a bit and CPC up a bit. But with the collapse in the NDP, the Libs may actually gain seats in Quebec even with a lower vote share than 2015. It’s a shame Mulcair was forced out.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained outside legal counsel in case of an RCMP investigation into allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group.




Mr. Trudeau’s communications director, Cameron Ahmad, told The Globe and Mail on Friday that Treasury Board rules allow for hiring of outside counsel when government officials are either sued, threatened with a suit, charged with an offence or under threat of being named in a legal action.




“As per the Treasury Board Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification, counsel has been retained to advise on the matter in question,” Mr. Ahmad said in an e-mail.




Mr. Ahmad would not provide further details or reveal the names of the law firms retained by Mr. Trudeau and staff in the Prime Minister’s Office, in response to a formal request last month for an RCMP investigation from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.




A senior government official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said an outside law firm has been hired to represent Mr. Trudeau, and another law firm will handle staff in the Prime Minister’s Office.




The second law firm will act on behalf of Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, Quebec adviser Mathieu Bouchard and senior adviser Elder Marques, the official said","<div class=""articlecontent"">

But nothing illegal was done? Why would they need lawyers? Lol!

Rex Murphy had a good one in the Post today:
“There is something in the Liberals’ behaviour touchingly reminiscent of the classic line from Dr. Strangelove: “Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here. This is the War Room.”

Committee chairman Anthony Housefather: “Witnesses? You can’t call for witnesses here. This is the justice committee.” “

I think Trudeau should drop the pretense, and just embrace his new stance of entitled authoritarianism fully and openly. You know, really go for it. He’ll need a new campaign song come October though. Perhaps AC/DC’s “Dirty Deeds (Done Dirt Cheap)” ?

Can’t be a bad move given the fact that no one in federal politics needs that kind of help more than they do. They could use as much outside help as they can get. But no of that will be capable of reversing their destined fate in October.

I’ve been pretty clear for weeks how disgusted I am with phony Justin and the histrionic clerk and all of their staff and the finance minister’s staff, all pretty much trying to obstruct justice while weasily trying to keep their hands clean about it. Until this eve I was convinced Trudeau was done for.

But then Scheer does stuff that is differently stupid in an immediately more gravely serious way and whoooooosh, the Con lead in metro suburbs across the county vanishes. Amazing.

Apart from the fact that Scheer was sleazy and passive-aggressive racist to try to suck up to Max’s base like this, he’s allowed a story about himself to become more important like the amateur he is.

“Yes he should’ve mentioned that the worshippers were Muslim, a stupid oversight but hardly fatal. How do you know it was intentional?”

My thoughts as well. Maybe he was trying (awkwardly) not to be too exploitative of the situation. “He was pandering to racists!” just doesn’t make any sense, since there really aren’t enough of the real hardcore types out there to make that worthwhile in terms of votes (even if you think Scheer himself is a closet racist, which I don’t).

Trudeau is reaping what he’s sowed. Unlike his father, who kept a careful eye on everything-each weakened he would look through memos and submissions from cabinet ministers re progress- this clown avoids work, responsibility, like the plague. Like grade ten students, writing a final examination unsupervised where all kinds of mischief occurs, our government may have turned into a rat’s nest of corruption, amorality, special interest, and incompetence.

We need to purge the LPC of this crud, elect a new leader, and use time in opposition to get it right. And the first step in getting it right, is to elect a new prime minister in waiting- Jody Wilson-Raybould. She would have my support, as well as the bass player for the Hot Nasties.

The really bizarre element of this news about Mr. Dressup and company going for lawyers (do we take this as an expression of guilt?) is that VAdm Mark Norman, who was publicly accused as guilty by Mr. Trudeau before he was even charged or enjoyed the courtesy of a trial, has been driven into bankruptsy for a much lesser misdeameanor than those for which Trudeau and company are being found culpable. Why should Mr. Trudeau and company enjoy public funding of their legal fees when he has denied the same consideration to the Admiral, especially when the evidence against the Admiral appears to be on far shakier ground than the evidence against Mr. Trudeau, The Clerk of the Privy Council and the PMO.

I’ve helped organizations through legal/comms crises many times.

I can tell you this is what this latest revelation means:
• their ability to communicate openly about the file comes to an abrupt end

• they now can’t take notes, send or receive email, etc. without disclosing them to the police, Ethics Commissioner, et al.

• they can’t delete past records without attracting more legal peril

• their lawyers are telling them, over and over, that they should not discuss the case with anyone, including their bosses

• their lawyers are reviewing, in advance, everything they hope to say about #LavScam – which necessarily slows down their responses in what is a fast-moving scandal

• the Opposition and the media are going to be watching the legal bills like hawks – and publicizing every penny (which the relevant law firms don’t ever like, and which sometimes leads to withdrawal)

• they are getting their legal bills paid by the taxpayer – but there’s usually a dollar limit, and the representation won’t cover wrongdoing done outside their government roles (ie., LPC)

• their legal bills will get very big very fast – which will inevitably create a whole new layer of scandal

• they may need to hire non-legal representation – comms counsel, for instance – and that inevitably means yet more costs which leads to yet more scandal

• they may need to start paying for additional legal representation out of their own pockets – which inevitably leads to them going home and their spouse saying: “We didn’t sign on for this. This is bankrupting us. You need to quit.”

And so on, and so on.

None of this would have happened if any of them had paid heed to the law – for instance, using “jobs” as an excuse to enter into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement is expressly prohibited in bribery cases (as this is) and Article Five of the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group Convention (which Canada has signed).

What kind of timeline are we talking? Weeks, months, years? It’s very disturbing JW-R followed the rule of law and acted on the DPP’s recommendation not to offer a DPA to SNC-Lavalin while Trudeau pleaded it was all a misunderstanding. Butts, in front of a Liberal dominated Justice Committee, said she lied, then wouldn’t allow her to rebut his claims. The court of public opinion believes her way more than those two buffoons. They should be footing the bill to defend themselves, not the taxpayers! It’s so easy when it’s OPM (other peoples money).

Olga,

That’s nothing. Just wait until JWR runs for leader. Rather than properly embrace her, they will move heaven and earth to prevent her from becoming leader.

It’s that mindset that has come to infect most of them and it’s precisely what’s killing the party.

Re: Conrad Black

Consider the source – a senior member of the laurentian elite – silver spoon and all. That he deflects from the issue at hand is no surprise.

A couple points on the allegations he makes:
He asserts Peter MacKay had “… earned considerable stature as either lawyers or legislators.” I Loled that.

And that she is what he says she is I have little quarrel. JT and the LPC have gone done the virtue-signalling bunnyhole and these are kind of negative results you get.

BUT he is lying through his teeth when he says SNC-lavalin and the decades of corruption are the side show. He KNOWS that’s a pile of dung. Many of his friends are in the firing line here and he’s trying to deflect in a most disgusting manner.

That has been very frustrating for me. There has been little play in the press that the DPA statutes were copied from the Americans and others…..and has specific guidelines as to why an outfit like SNC would NOT qualify for a DPA.
On another note….rumours of irregularities in the financing of the pipeline and BMO?? Follow the money

The RCMP are going to have a hard time covering this up especially Deputy Commissioner Michaud. The RCMP charged SNC Lavelin for bribery in the first place and since bribery does not allow for a DPA..deferred prosecution agreement under the Anti Bribery Convention and since the economy can’t be used either for DPA the PMO office with the PM have been caught redhanded implicating themselves in obstruction of Justice on a number of points. Then factor in undue pressure as alleged by JWR and the criminal charges are very relevant and unless the RCMP set the example that corruption at any level especially at the highest level is not acceptable to Canadians by bringing these charges they are a disgrace to law enforcement and even undermine their own investigation and eventual charges against SNC Lavalin. Hypocrisy at its finest on display for the whole world if nothing is done That Wernick guy needs added charges for perjury and inciting violence with his words about assassinations. A true disgrace to Canadians as well.

This liberal party with Justin Trudeau rammed through the change to the criminal code allowing DPA’s in order to benefit a company that was not eligible for a DPA and this government further muddied the waters by trying to obstruct justice by pressuring then firing the Justice Minister who would not flinch on the Rule of Law and allow the DPA which had already been denied by the Public Prosecution Office who followed the Rile of Law as well. Can’t wiggle out of obstruction of justice charges no matter how you spin it.

Warren says:

In nutshell, yes. Along with not being a criminal sanction – and therefore preferable, for sensible free-speechers – section 13 only concerned the Internet and telephonic messages.

Oh, it went beyond that, I think. I’m no free speech warrior and I salute you and Lisa for the fight against Ward News, but there were big problems with S. 13, including a whiff of institutional corruption in the CHRC. I’d like to see something beyond criminal sanctions, but is hate speech really a low-level administrative problem, especially in the age of Twitter mobs?

“Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

My conclusion is that I have enough information to know that I cannot come to one.

Typical of most parliamentary committees, the hearings involved laughably short periods for each questioner – just when someone was getting somewhere, whoops, time for someone else fom another party to ask a question that broke the continuity. Humiliatingly useless for an independent observer to discover any truth whatsoever. Can’t blame just the Liberals for that, it’s been a standard feature of these bullsh*t committees for ever.

Most of what I witnessed was more emotional than factual testimony. No way to learn a damn thing. Not that such thin gruel did anything to prevent pundits from forming an opinion and galloping off in every direction at once to further muddy the waters. It was “pick a side” time, using whatever “info” bolstered an individual pundit’s opinion, and forgetting any that opposed it. How grandly we have all been served!

Apparently, I am not blessed with the outstanding intellectual capacity of the Liberals on the Justice Committee, each and every one of whom quite obviously deserve nominations for the Nobel Prize for Genius. What seems so abundantly clear and obvious to them has led to the proclamation that they have delivered enough information for my mere pleb brain to come to the same biased conclusion they have unerringly zeroed in on. Like I said, they’re just an “aw shucks” bunch of ethically outstanding, rollickingly great parliamentarians focused on the truth while exhibiting the trappings of pure genius. As if. I used to conduct safety investigations after accidents, and the procedures of this parliamentary committee wouldn’t make the first cut as being suitable for any objective examination of facts.

Of course, if the Conservatives were in power and dominating a parliamentary committee, they’d act precisely as the Liberals are doing now. The basic operating thrust of all these committees is to keep the serfs obfuscated, misinformed, underinformed, and just this side of rebellion for being openly manipulated.

The entire system of “enquiry” by parliamentary committee stinks. It’s pure bullsh*t from beginning to end. In my humble opinion. And pundits need to show some real objectivity as well if they think they’re any good.

What a circus.

The under-the-radar effect on the election will be the changes is small business taxation and accounting rules from last years budget.

My brother runs his own (non-incorporated) family and labour law practice and has always voted Liberal. He won’t be this year. I expect there are many more like him.

He has finally seen the Liberal Party is for the elites only after they bludgeoned him over the head with the accounting changes (not the tax changes) for small businesses.

A lot of individuals with be filing taxes under the new rules for the first time this spring. I expected it will change the minds of a lot of people who typically saw themselves as Liberals.

I would expect that a large number of small business owners are coming to grips with this same fallout from the changes. I know I am…

I work in the technology business where the whole “gig/contract” model is a way of life. That has all gone by the wayside now.

I could not speak for other business areas but what I do is a fungible asset, in great demand south of border and in other jurisdictions. Being treated from a tax perspective as just an employee while taking the risks of an independent rankles to say the least. A substantial number of colleagues concur.

Never mind losing votes. The real problem not yet realized is the potential for the departure of such skilled people.

The fallout of these misguided changes have not yet begun to be felt.

Exactly right. The original intent was to go after professionals like doctors who, by the way, in Ontario, were given the ability to incorporate as part of their collective bargaining with the Ontario government(while Butts and Telford were there) as an offset to fee reductions. So, ironic that the same bunch took those same bargained tax benefits away from them. Many doctors were either apolitical or liberals. Many are now motivated, donating Tories. Going after the professionals had unintended consequences to people like BobM. The new TOSI rules get applied to businesses that don’t necessarily make widgets but there is no way they should be caught up in the new regime given that many employee hundreds of employees at great risk to the shareholders. The rules also have many other unintended consequences and bugs that are too technical to explain in a short post but that is what happens when a naive government tries to ram major tax reform through without taking the time to do it properly. There was a reason the last major tax reform(the recommendations of the Carter Commission with respect to the taxation of capital gains and the concept of integration) took almost 10 years from the formation of the commission in 1962 to legislation in 1971. These things are very complicated. Even that reform took many years after 1971 to iron out the bugs. These latest changes were done too quickly in a haphazard, incompetent manner and should have been looked at as part of a comprehensive tax reform package that many are calling for.

That is how our young man tried to sell it but it is nowhere near that simple and people in Finance don’t even understand the unintended consequences that relate to holding companies, the definition of a “service business” in today’s tech economy, etc. and the technical issues they have created so it is understandable your typical civilian voter won’t. Ask them a direct question and they will say “we will have to see”. As mentioned, to try and explain the issues would take a multiple page post so I am not going to do it here. Will provide one small example though. I have one situation where a couple got bought out and retired based on a certain set of taxation rules and the CRA has now changed those rules resulting in a doubling of their tax bill which may have changed their retirement decision. There is no world where that is fair. Finance has historically made changes on a go forward basis. They didn’t in this case which was just one of the many problems with their obviously flawed rollout.

How exactly to the tax changes impact you?

I understand there is an extra tax on interest you collect from money stored in your company, but that would only be a benefit if you have maxed out your RRSPs and TSAs, and even then the interest you get these days saving money for a couple of years would be pretty small.

As Martin mentions, the TOSI “rules”. I can’t even provide my wife with a dividend at reasonable tax rate.

This is the same woman who literally shoveled dirt to make whatever income possible to get this business going. It is now being construed as tax cheating were she to receive a dividend for that work and sacrifice and taxed at the maximum rate.

The other dirty little secret I have seen nowhere in the media is the fact that a lot of the unexpected revenue that they are spending was tax that many people prepaid last year to take advantage of various family members’ low tax brackets for the last time before the changes came into force. That revenue will dry up but the impact won’t be seen until after the election.

Trudeau resorted to a grade five tactic: making faces, sarcastically smiling at the adults across the isle. Well at least this time he didn’t stick out his tongue.

So is it fair to argue that the LPC boosted spending several billion in an attempt to provide additional cover for the SNC-LAVALIN cover-up?

If so the billions in reputational cost now have billions in government waste added to the pyre that is the vain attempt to save JTs political skin.

…

Deficits and debt now out well past 2050 (they won’t even make an estimate now)

No tax cuts – continue to make Canada hopelessly uncompetitive versus the US.

The housing measures are ridiculous. They will simply spike demand thereby raising asking prices. In the end, this will cause young buyers to pay MORE, not less. However as much as I despise this government, I know that the Conservatives would have introduced similarly boneheaded policy. When it comes to housing, both parties are equally in bed with the realtor cartel and committed to inflating the bubble.

As long as Canada opens the door to far more people than existing housing stock and infrastructure can support (and 3x more per capita than the US), there will be zero relief. Great for Boomers who won the birth lottery and bought 30-40 years ago. Horrible for Millennials.

I just found out a bit more about this absurd CMHC equity sharing scam/scheme. So apparently if a property goes up in value, the CMHC gets to participate in that appreciation – that is, the loan is paid back upon selling plus % appreciating. No word yet on what happens if the home values depreciates.

This is infuriating. The government now has clear financial incentive, in addition to political incentive, to inflate the housing bubble to infinity. And the taxpayer now assumes far more of the risk if it all goes to hell. This is shockingly bad policy I’m almost speechless.

Unbelievable. For weeks now, Trudeau has been repeating ad nauseam that 9,000 Canadian jobs would be lost if SNC-Lavalin were to be convicted, that his priority is saving those jobs – and now the CEO of Lavalin has pulled the rug out from under him by saying, nope, we never told him that and it isn’t true. If the Liberals had hoped to put this behind them, well, it just keeps getting worse and worse.

True – but if they call it early, people will wonder why. If they wait, maybe there’s a chance that fewer people will pay attention. That may seem like questionable reasoning, but then again I’m constantly astonished at how little attention people pay to politics in general, and facts in particular.

498,Warren Kinsella,The Jane Philpott interview: this is extraordinary,2019-03-21 08:54:00,Warren,,"Paul Wells and Maclean’s have got the first interview with Jane Philpott – former Minister of Health, former Treasury Board President, former Minister of Indigenous Services – and it is incredible.

From the very first time I met Jane, and spoke at her riding association many years ago, I believed her to be principled and brilliant. And the kind of person we need in public life.

Reading some of the snippets below, I am reminded of how principled and brilliant she truly is. And I convinced, more than ever, that the true is like water.

It will find a way out.

**


Q: When you left cabinet, did you have a strategic goal in mind? What was the point of resigning?

A: I resigned because I could not maintain solidarity with cabinet on the specific issue of the management of the SNC-Lavalin issue. I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.

A: No. There’s much more to the story that should be told.

Q: What sort of stuff?

A: I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share. There was a reference by Gerry Butts in his testimony of the fact that I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA [deferred prosecution agreement]. This was more than a month before the story became public. And I ordinarily would have not been allowed to share that information. But of course it’s already on the public record from the Justice Committee. I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?

Q: In what forum would you like to discuss all of this?

A: My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story. I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.

Q: Mr. Butts said, essentially, ‘Come on, this doesn’t rise to the level of harassment, or bugging, or even sustained engagement. It’s 20 interactions over four months. It’s two phone calls and two meetings per month.’

A: The constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system is such that the attorney general of our country should not be subjected to political interference in any way. Whether there is one attempt to interfere or whether there are 20 attempts to interfere, that crosses ethical and constitutional lines.

Q: Now there’s an Ethics Commissioner investigation. Michael Wernick seemed to have a lot of confidence in the Ethics Commissioner. Do you think that can capture everything that needs capturing?

A: My sense is that they will not have the appropriate tools to be able to get at all of this.

Q: What’s missing?

A: If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories?

Q: The Finance Minister [Bill Morneau] said your resignation from cabinet was an expression of personal friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. What do you make of that?

A: I think that’s an insult.

Q: How so?

A: I don’t make decisions on any policy — and definitely not on a matter of principle — based on friendship. I made the very difficult decision to step down because my conscience demanded it","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Yes plenty more to the story. RCMP to investigate. But wait SNC Lavalin should have been under surveillance by the RCMP after the Charbonneau Commission because of election improprieties and the other bribery charges to see if there were others.
Therefore what does the RCMP know about SNC Lavalin and Trudeau link. The discussions and possible bribery that may have occurred to bring about the DPA coming into law is what many Canadians are asking about and whether the RCMP have checked Butts Trudeau and others bank accounts for bribe money and were they conducting at any time surveillance on SNC Lavalin in order to observe wrongful conduct between PMO and SNC Lavalin.

What are all the other Liberal MP’s thinking when they vote to end the Justice Committee hearings. Dont they have their own brain to see what 67 percent and my guess its higher of Canadians who believe JWR . Spineless backless individuals who have no clue how to represent the Canadians who voted for them. If they did they would join JWR and Jane Philpotts . They are blindly obstructing justice themselves and support a PM that did the same. Michelle Rempell pretty much displays what the job of a MP is by her comments and questions and continual attacks against the integrity of the PM and his government. . So does Lisa Raitt. The amount of commendation these 2 woman are getting is incredible. They exemplify what you expect from a representative guarding your public interests and human rights.

Having lost confidence in JT how can she campaign in her riding for his party? It’s ridiculous.

She’s staying because the party is bigger than any one individual, obviously. It doesn’t belong to whoever happens to be leader at a given moment.

If you cant speak then resign but stop sitting on the fence. Do something. Celina is a pretty weak MP but she stood up yesterday. Staying in caucus is tarnishing the integrity you are trying to protect. Trudeau is still at the helm and only an election can take him down. So dance with the devil you know, keep quiet or expose the rot and let someone else in there. Hard choices for people with integrity but who still crave power.

Standing up for a just and fair liberal party is clearly a tight rope walk in the present circumstances but doesn’t necessarily entail a desire for leadership rather an awakening of conscience from latent party members who also in their hearts want fairness and integrity. At present her only ‘leadership’ comes from lighting the path for others to find for themselves.

Most of what they say is carefully balanced political babble, designed to deflect away from the truth. It’s remarkable when you hear one of them speaking forthrightly and truthfully. It suggests to me that she believes her political career to be over.

Speaking of babble, when JT was taking questions this morning . . . ugh. The guy is basically incapable of thinking on his feet and saying anything compelling or coherent when he’s challenged by a question. Especially when he’s in deer-in-headlights mode.

The other thing is, anyone with half a political brain can see the Liberals’ transparent communication strategy, which is: immediately change the channel and talk about how fabulous the economy is doing and how the economy is really what matters etc. Which is, irony of ironies, also the fallback communication strategy of the Trump White House. What’s that old saying about the company you keep?

I agree, Pierre’s and Margaret’s child is not a nibble thinker and his constant babble about jobs is tiresome.

IMHO, Trudeau also looks po’d that he has to answer something as he stumbles out on a non-answer. It shows in his eyes. He cannot hide his irritation with the questioning despite trying to sound reasonable and telling us how he is Justin, Patron Saint of Employment Preservation.

I hated the constant droning of the same answer no matter the question by the Cons and Harper, and for this government to revert to this playbook sickens me.

As a lifelong right-of-center voter from Alberta, I can tell you if the Liberals turfed Trudeau and elevated Philpot and JWR to the leadership of the party, I would vote Liberal in a second just to show all these career politicians that the average person would rather vote for someone who is proven to have ethics and principals, than to vote for someone who purports to represent my fiscal/social views and then does the opposite.

Further, if Philpot and JWR were in charge, and ran on a platform of removing the extreme grip party leaders have over their parties, turning QP into a legitimate effort by the government to provide real answers to questions of Canadians, and giving power to our local representatives to influence their parties and or governments actions…I would go out and knock on doors for the Librrals.

Enough pandering and politics. Average Canadians want some grownups in charge who are there to represent our interests. Not that of their election machine.

The problem is that it would appear as though this was just the icing on the cake and that much more has gone on in this government in terms of silencing people and differing opinions. I watched every hour – but a few in both the House and the Senate on Bill C45 and I can tell you there was nothing open and transparent about the process, witnesses and testimony was not just cherry picked it was orchestrated, documents shredded that didn’t fit in, and documents manufactured that suited the purpose – people not allowed to speak – who could have and should provided the evidence of science – this was after all supposed to be evidence based policy – it was nothing of the sort. Then look at the task force – all that testimony from the public is sealed – that’s right sealed – so why is the question all this praise for the Minister of Health at the time – Jane Philpott – with a medical background who let this happen ? She went along with the Trudeau plan – and had to know the science and the fact that more not less people would use marijuana and therefore suffer harm as a result – I applaud those who stand up now – but where were they in the previous years when all of this was happening – Elbow Gate, Gropping Charges, etc etc. etc.

If the objective of politics is to hold power via the helm we can rest assured knowing that the LPC is maintaining the core objectives of power & politics. Moreover, the LPC has a majority mandate and no logical reason to acquiesce to opposition demands of political suicide.

Filibustering by opposition is not going to sway any liberals.
With a clear majority mandate the LPC will simply ignore opposition theatrics and wait for the writ. Opposition appeals to Canadians will be lost amongst the election noise pre-election and the LPC will end up making opposition look like sour grapes in the minds of average Canadian voters once the writ is signed. People will sour at the prospect of a Conservative win for the next electoral round. The majority of Canadians will want to see Trudeau for the second term and not Scheer. Campaigning on the political weakness of the LPC will not yield the results the CPC want.

As long as JWR remains in caucus Canadians will look favourably at the LPC for the second term leg of leadership.

The question is – what is the punishment for breaking your cabinet oath. Up until now, Trudeau has broken many of the ethics rules, where the fines were not high.
It would suspect that cabinet confidence is the same thing – no actual harsh penalties, but one would be viewed as unethical. Not the image anyone would want – except for Trudeau, who doesn’t seem to mind if he’s viewed that way, as long as his hair looks good.

I’m guessing Barton didn’t dare bring Coyne to the table for this one, as he’d destroy them all with his take on the BS. They really must think Canadians are stupid and don’t realize we see right through the Sgro/Delacourt crap. Besides the legal implications, I minute in the H of C, if the Liberal whip even gave them a time allotment, is not enough to tell this story completely. Call in the RCMP.

Seeing as their is no reasonable expectation that Trudeau will lift solicitor-client privilege for JWR and cabinet confidentiality for both her and Dr Philpott does a public inquiry have the power to compel anyone involved in the matter to speak regardless of the wishes of PM Virtue Signal?

Is there any means to force a public inquiry when the current govt refuses to call one?

Let’s be honest here, this govt’s behavior in the VAdm Norman prosecution, in which the defense have signaled the intention of filing a motion to dismiss for being politically motivated, is just as serious and egregious an attack on the integrity of our justice system and reinforces a pattern of reprehensible behavior by this govt.

The behavior of govt officials to date in the hearings on evidence disclosure have been highly reminiscent of organized crime trials, no one can remember anything let alone key events and surprise, surprise, no one took any notes! (this in a country where govt LOVES to generate paper trails!

As the saying goes “the fish rots from the head down” and this fish is particularly putrid.

So true.
1st glance Trudeau violated law to protect jobs in Quebec (even though he didn’t care about jobs in rest of Canada.
2nd, Trudeau violated law for Quebec votes.
3rd, Trudeau violated law for continued donations from SNC executives.
4th, Trudeau violated law to hide criminality of himself and Liberals in some sort kick-back scheme from previously – that they desperately don’t want to be revealed in open court.

The more Trudeau tries to silence the women and other participants, the more I believe it’s on the worse end of the list.

If she gets to respond a second time, surely it’s only fair for everyone else who testified to respond again.

Personally, I think JWR & Philpot genuinely believe they were inappropriately pressured. But I also think that the general public will not interpret the actual evidence in the same manner. The PMO was talking to the Justice Minister, JWR/Philpot are arguing from the AG’s position. If the positions of AG and Justice Minister were split up, there would be no controversy.

AFAICT, the Justice Minister can’t overrule the Director of Public Prosecutions, only the AG can. As such, the PMO was talking to, and applying pressure to, JWR as AG, not JWR as the Justice Minister. I’m not sure why the public would think otherwise.

Needless to say, yup, these positions should be split up. And if the AG still ended up being appointed from the pool of MPs, then the AG should not be allowed to do anything even remotely partisan, e.g., should not attend caucus meetings.

Zeke,

With respect, their continued stonewalling is killing them with the general public, or at least those who choose to pay attention or are political animals.

Quite obviously, JWR will use every parliamentary and procedural method at her disposal to force the committee’s hand. And that will push the PMO over the edge into absolute crisis-mode. Things have gone from terribly bad to infinitely worse — and they remain adrift at sea, at the mercy of tides they can in no way control.

3. We now know with certainty that SNC Lavalin never threatened to leave Canada, nor were 9000 jobs in play.
4. Butts refused to testify under oath.
5. Ms. Katie T has been MIA.
6. Jody and Jane are now being goaded and blamed for NOT speaking in hopes they will take the bait when Trudeau has them in a straightjacket and muzzle. Were they to speak, these same people will be demanding they be:10 booted from the LPC, 2) be jailed and charged, 3) be disbarred (JWR)

It takes a majority of Parliamentarians to maintain confidence in a government.

From everything I’ve seen so far I’m pretty safe coming to the conclusion that something took place after JWR’s shuffle to Veteran’s Affairs that Trudeau is VERY nervous about seeing the light of day. Something that JWR and Jane Philpott either have firsthand knowledge of or evidence of. Something so bad that JT would prefer the continued bad optics by keeping them muzzled, and blatantly shutting down all further inquiries into, than let them speak openly. Something so concerning that Butts, Wernick resigned before it came out, while stating they did nothing wrong. Something so important that JWR and Jane Philpotts’ consciences won’t let them drop it, at huge personal, political and professional cost because they think Canadians need to know. This isn’t party sabotage and straw grasping. There’s more going on here.

It is very smart to be doing this stuff through the committee. Doing it on her own with a press conference or in the house would remove the official nature and seriousness of what is being discussed. It also affirms that other M.P.s want to get to the bottom of this. Doing it through the committee is actually parliamentary strategy at its finest.

Alas, Jagmeet does not inspire my confidence, and the CPC is just nowhere near my values, by and large. So failing Liberal, it’s Green for me I think.

Problem is, what does it say about yours or any local liberal MP that has not spoken publicly about the need to get answers. The Liberals can be thankful that Andrew Scheer is leading the Conservatives, however, other then remaining in power at any legal or illegal means, what exactly is the vision of Liberals right now? As a Conservative I am so frustrated with my party for its lack of direction and social values, but I also think most Liberals are as well with Trudeau. At a time on our history when we desperately need Leadership we get we get this sad group. Lizzy May anyone?

Harper had the best GDP growth in the G7, best jobs growth in G7, and lowest increase in debt in the G7 . We now also know that Harper is the only PM not to be found guilty , by an independent office of parliament, of violating the Ethics Act since it’s inception. It’s also nice that Harper never assaulted a woman in the House of Commons, or used and abused women like chattel.
Every Liberal MP, save for maybe 3 or 4, are condoning the behavior of Trudeau by their silence.
Not a single voter who cares about this country will vote Liberal until their is a full house cleaning.

No his government was just the first to be found in contempt of parliament in Canada’s history.

Right now, Scheer has an edge with at least a minority in view, like it or not. (I don’t. But I don’t as a rule wear blinders. I left that for the last three PMOs.)

The strength she has in her convictions is remarkable. For four hours she spoke to the old boy’s club and provided a credible account of what took place-I loved the endorsement she got when Elizabeth May cross examined Butts: I believe every word she said.

Now the Trudeautards are grasping at straws. Susan Delacourt is trying to undermine JWR and Jane Philapott by suggesting their offensive is highly organized as to suggest they’re part of a deep rooted conspiracy. The heart broken Delacourt discredits herself even more.

Sheila Copps, the octopus eater, was very aggressive in her contempt for JWR. But her offensive blew up in her face like a shotgun that backfired. And good old Rosey Barton
has never swayed from her affections -never expect more from a pig than a grunt as my father use to say.

As a partisan non-Liberal (you can take the boy out of Calgary, but will never take the Calgary out of the boy) and Trudeau hater, I’ve watched the Liberal self immolation with an ever widening smile on my face . That being said, the only rational explanation of recent events would be a coup plot to topple Butts/Telford and their avatar PM. Why haven’t JWR and Jane Philpot been ejected from caucus? Harper or Chretien would have tossed anyone who went off message. The drip-drip actions of JWR, JP and CCC seem designed to exact maximum damage. Warren is correct in stating their chess skills. So here’s another question: which operative(s) are helping them? I’m not calling their competence or intelligence into question, but all three are relative political neophytes. Who is the chess master?

Does Trump win as a result of this summary? Well, narrowly so on collusion. It’s a wash on obstruction — because after 22 months Mueller himself did not find the evidence sufficiently probative to subpoena the President of the United States.

But it would be naive to suggest that other ongoing investigations are at least looking at Trump as a person of interest. So, Trump likely isn’t out of the woods just yet.

This Hillary/Uranium one thing is such BS. Go check out the CFIUS statute that was in play (Committee on Foreign Investment in the US). The transaction required the approval of NINE different government departments. The State Department was only one of nine.

So it was not Hillary Clinton’s deal to approve. She was one of only nine decision makers.

So stop peddling that Trump Bootlicker BS that suggests that she singlehandedly approved the deal.

“The transaction required the approval of NINE different government departments. The State Department was only one of nine.”

Wrong. It’s not nine government departments…it’s nine people who were all (?) appointed by (and worked for) the President of the United States (in this case, Barack Obama).

“The Committee on Foreign Investments has nine members, including the secretaries of the treasury, state, defense, homeland security, commerce and energy; the attorney general; and representatives from two White House offices (the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy).”

As for “requiring approval”:
“The committee can’t actually stop a sale from going through — it can only approve a sale. The president is the only one who can stop a sale, if the committee or any one member “recommends suspension or prohibition of the transaction,”

So Hillary wasn’t solely responsible for approving it (nor did the poster above claim she was), but she also didn’t oppose it either.

And of course, you conveniently forget to mention that the real scandal involving Hillary Clinton, and the one most people are so outraged by, is *not* the fact that she was one of the people who approved it, but the fact that she alone seems to have profited by it:
“The Times detailed how the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from investors in Uranium One.

The donations from those with ties to Uranium One weren’t publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, even though Hillary Clinton had an agreement with the White House that the foundation would disclose all contributors. Days after the Times story, the foundation acknowledged that it “made mistakes,” saying it had disclosed donations from a Canadian charity, for instance, but not the donors to that charity who were associated with the uranium company.”

THAT’S the scandal. Right there (and you know it).

Stop peddling Clinton Bootlicker BS, Doc. Doesn’t look good on you.

On this point, I think there’s a reasonable explanation that doesn’t involve inappropriate PMO interference.

The lobbying registry shows multiple SNC communications with PMO both before & after DPP declined to offer the DPA in Sept. 2018. Multiple contacts were with Bouchard and/or Marques. It’s entirely plausible that the SNC rep shared info with Bouchard/Marques that the corporation had gained via its own counsel on the criminal charges.

Based on personal experience as a Crown agent for PPSC, regular discussion of the DPA issue would’ve been happening between SNC defence counsel & the trial prosecutor(s). However, those trial prosecutors wouldn’t necessarily have authority to grant a DPA, even if they were sympathetic to SNC’s arguments.

PMO has botched this entire file, and certainly applied inappropriate pressure on JW-R, but I hold out faint hope their people weren’t so dumb and/or corrupt to make direct contact with the trial prosecutor(s).

Vancouverois says:

I thought of this too – the information may have come from SNC-Lavalin. But how would SNC-Lavalin know about disagreements within the Prosecutor’s office? I doubt they would get that from their direct negotiations with the office; I’d expect the Prosecutor’s team to act like, well, a team.

So where did the information come from?

Indeed, further evidence that JT is/was “not ready” for prime time as the notorious Harper Conservatives’ ad campaign alleged! All because of JT’s dumb axiom that “because it’s 2915” the cabinet HAD to be 59% women irrespective of their qualifications! Now that was/is stupid.

It is almost painful to watch the machinations which are (and have been) unfolding at the hands of the PMO and government in in general, realizing that it would probably have never come to this point if the PM had allowed Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak freely from the very beginning.

There would no doubt have been one or two thrown under the bus, but undoubtedly far less than have been so far (or to come).

I also believe that if Trudeau had managed this properly, there was enough time for the government to overcome this well before the election.

Unfortunately for Trudeau and those who perpetuate this web of deceit, the more they struggle, the worse it will get.

Different lines being spun as fast as I can try them. In this case, the idea is that Trudeau removed JWR not for the immediately previous disagreement over SNC, but in fact about the one that terminated with a Supreme Court appointment of his choice almost a year earlier. Nothing to see here.

And of course, MacDonald at CBC this morning now trying to frame it as leadership politics, another round of the Chretien-Turner wars, or even comparing their role to Mulroney’s efforts to unseat Clark. So are we to presume that one of JWR or Philpott have leadership aspirations?

What this clearly speaks to is the desperation Trudeau and his minions are prepared to go to, in an effort to ‘Not Let Her Speak’. It’s intended to leak something as confidential as discussions between the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister regarding the appointment of a judge, without ever having to speak to those discussions, to present one side that paints Jody Wilson Raybold as vindictive and a “woman scorned”. This is not only internecine political warfare at its worst, but its a breach of confidentiality of the highest order. Why? Because “HE” knows. Justin knows what she knows and will share – the Truth in all it’s nakedness. Its facts not feelings. Facts not experiences. Not her truth versus someone else’s version of truth. Just the facts ma’am. And HE too knows those facts. And those facts can’t ever see the light of day. Because if they do, Trudeau’s career is over, and he will take his rightful place as one of the worst Prime Ministers this country has ever had. So he gave the codes to his henchman to go nuclear. Smear Jody and let the sycophantic media do the rest. And hope it works. Liberal Party, its high noon; heal thyself. Dump your Leader now before its too late. Trudeau has become the Canadian version of Trump. The question is, will the Liberal Caucus enable Trudeau to make the Liberal party into his own version of the current Republican Party.

When did you for example, first hear or read of it ? How about Andrew Coyne? Robert Fife? CBC hosts, CTV panelists ? What ?? There is a sort of collective memory failure ? Collective ‘senior moments’ ? This ‘breaking news’ went public.. so who ‘broke it’ ? Start there.. that person or persons are the folks who should be interviewed, grilled or laughed out of town. That is the ‘story’. One media outburst breathlessly mentioned – ‘a source so credible & high up, only they would know this’ (words to that effect) Who or what media outlet uttered that phrase ? And why ? How did they ‘know’ this.. and from whom ?

When did Mainstream Media get permission (and from whom?) to be partisan, lazy or polarizing pimps of rumor, fiction, innuendo or presumptuous flawed logic ?

Many years ago after joining Twitter I was trying to get the lay of the land and somehow was influenced by Dean Scorioka or some guy with a name like that. This resulted in being blocked by all kinds of folks, including Trudeau himself.

That was early and since then I’ve come to know who my friends and allies are-Ray Heard, Lori Goldstein, and others whom I follow and visa versa.

For some reason I must have gotten under your skin, and after a while you thought it best we go our seperate ways.

IN MEMORIAM

We regret to announce the death of Canadian Justice (né Rule of Law) which occurred suddenly in Ottawa on 19 March, 2019.
Born in the UK, under the auspices of the Westminster system, the late Ms. Justice emigrated to Canada where she enjoyed a long, fascinating life.
Although having never married, Justice was courted by a variety of suitors, and was predeceased by her siblings Moral Compass, and Public Trust (both of Ottawa); she is survived by her only child – Faint Hope (whereabouts currently unknown).
After a courageous battle with Cover-up lasting several months, Justice met her untimely end when she was ultimately declared unfit to make her own decisions, and a euthanasia order was given by her guardians.
At the behest of The PMO, there will be no visitation with burial in an undisclosed location at a later date.
In lieu of flowers, complaints may be made to the RCMP or a Member of Parliament of your choice.

A normal leader in a normal caucus would expel JWR and JP without hesitation. The problem with this leader is that no one really takes JT seriously and never really did. Whereas everyone takes JWR and JP very seriously. When conflict arises within this team, it automatically causes talk of resignation because it is plainly obvious that certain members of the team are more competent than he is. If this leader expands the conflict at all and actually asserts himself in any way, resignation talk will quickly turn into Leadership Convention timelines. This is why JWR and JP are left in caucus. If they are banished, the house of cards will tumble very quickly.

As Trudeau and his merry band of unethical incompetents continue to dig themselves into a deeper hole, other real economic issues are being ignored.

The trade issues with China have as one result the ban of canola exports as well as other grains which could cost Canada’s GDP many billions of dollars and affect thousands of jobs and spin off industry. The vast majority of the hit will be in the western commodity producing provinces that for some time have been large contributers to the federal equalization formula, Quebec and the maritimes the major recipients.

With the oil industry handcuffed by overregulation resulting from grossly imbalanced pandering to special interest groups, this major blow to agriculture is another nail in the coffin of western alienation.

This country is on a downward spiral economically and needs a drastic change in course by leadership that makes decisions based on fiscally responsible policy first and foremost. The Trudeau led Liberals have shown to be complete failures as they bounce from one scandal to the next, just like Nero frantically fiddling while Rome burns.

I agree that the country is on the precipice of serious economic hardship, and the current government doesn’t seem particularly concerned. This boils down to a few core deficiencies with JT and his crew:
1. They are more concerned with projecting a “sensitive” image, than they are with growing the economy and helping everyday people. Save the climate! Save the downtrodden non-union workers! Save the ! Damn the cost and damn the fallout. At least I get my picture on Time magazine and the BBC!

2. They continue to have a view that Quebec is the centre of the Canadian universe, and must be appeased at all costs. Whether it be SNC Lavalin now, or Bombardier a few years ago, or the sponsorship scandal in the 90s; there is often a Quebec element to these problems.

3. Expanding on the above two points, there seems to be a hierarchy of “favored” industries. If it is in Quebec or Ontario, it is worth saving without question. If it is in the West, well then gee whiz, there are just so many considerations! Tough and complex factors at play!

That said, in fairness, the canola situation really is not of Canada’s making. As much as we detest Trump, we were asked to uphold our international agreements and detain the Huawei exec. China is a flaky trading partner, and this isn’t the first time they’ve placed non-tariff barriers on canola (see the blackleg situation from a few years ago as proof).

This is just more evidence that we need to take the economic gifts we have been handed (eg: oil & gas), which can benefit the entire country, rather than allowing them to get stymied by special interest groups. Bill C-69 is proof positive of JT’s naive view that we can have our cake and eat it too, and please everyone all of the time. Just load up on debt, and I’m sure it will all work out.

If Canada is committed to international cooperation on US judicial matters, why isn’t Omar Khadr ( plead guilty to the murder of a US soldier and is currently evading a civil lawsuit in the US) under detention and then extradited to the US? Instead he just yesterday received a judgement declaring his sentence complete and all restrictions lifted.
Khadr was under conditional release the last four years enjoying a $10.5 million settlement courtesy the Canadian taxpayer. Once again, the flaws entrenched in the Canadian charter were successfully employed in the Khadr case and others like it and directly impact the Canadian economy and international reputation to our detriment.

Maybe I’m mistaken, but I would think our balance of trade with China would dwarf that of Afghanistan and would warrant some descretionary handling of sensitive matters.

Mike,

This is a scenario where he wins big with those who are little lambs in caucus by kicking them out and loses big-time with voters if he does. They’ve already figured that one out, hence demolition derby tactics, which will only blow up in their face. They don’t believe that part: maybe, just maybe, they should keep a close eye on Liberal numbers.

My feeling is that JWR and JP are sitting back watching this play out, forcing his hand.

Why would they do anything different, and what better approach to take than the one they are?

Here’s the Canadian Bar Association’s reaction:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference. Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

And here is the Manitoba Bar Association:

“It is vital any deliberations leading up to any appointment remain confidential. The recent breaches of confidentiality…[are] highly disconcerting. It demeans the entire selection process…The Manitoba Bar Association is also deeply concerned about comments made about Chief Justice Joyal…[which were] entirely improper and indeed false…It is appalling.”

Would it be as painful to watch blood thirsty wolves continuously make speculative assumptions? More importantly – how many times in the day do you find yourself fantasizing about what ius going on with JT? Perhaps his dreaminess has enraptured you in ways you are not yet willing to consider?

Believing JT orchestrated this is fanciful, but not (thus far) grounded in evidence. Given how we have seen two caucus members resign (for their own reasons), why is it not possible that another lone wolf leaked this (also, for their own reasons)?

He thought being PM would be fun – lots of adoring fans clamouring for selfies, international travel, gushing articles and photo-ops in the Canadian and foreign media, showing off his colourful socks to foreign leaders – and for a while, that’s what happened. He must be puzzled and dismayed, wondering where it all went wrong.

This is further evidence that the PMO (and I am giving the benefit of the doubt to the Liberal Party in general – I have faith that there are still some with ethical roots) has decided that the gloves are off.

That being said, I wonder what will be the tipping point which makes certain women come forward (as referenced many months ago by W.) to release their affidavits (and yes, I realize that it is their decision to make, and there will undoubtedly be ramifications- we MUST support them) to tell the true story which will shake this Trudeau “house of cards” regime at it’s very foundation.

Why did JWR put in an unsolicited proposal/endorsement for an SCC justice to the PM anyway? It’s not how things are done, and as a lawyer she should have known that. The approved process is detailed on this website:
http://www.fja-cmf.gc.ca/scc-csc/smartin-report-rapport-eng.html

People nominate themselves for a position as Justice on SCC, and the Independent Advisory Board gathers these applications and puts forward 3 to 5 decent prospects for the PM’s consideration. The PM then picks the Justice from the list just as Trudeau said. There’s no argument about the procedure, no “yes, buts” or “what ifs” or “what abouts”. The PM shouldn’t be receiving third party endorsements for someone to be made a Justice – which is what JWR apparently did if I’m to believe news reports.

So why did she do it when a bit of googling and/or just phoning the PM would have established what the procedure for nomination/vetting was? Maybe Joyal applied himself to the IAB, maybe he didn’t, that’s entirely his personal business but it was his decision and his alone to make. Why is a third party involved apparently advocating for him? It’s not clear if he was even aware this advocacy was going on, and now he’s stuck having to defend himself. You blame the PM about leaks, and I wonder about why JWR apparently interfered in the first place to cause this latest controversy. It’s time for facts, not blather – the rightly aggrieved Joyal has not been served well by either side. Not at all.

I’m getting fed up with all the leaping around going on from all sides in this whole SNC-L affair and subsequent appendices. So are my friends who wave away all the nattering as counterproductive rubbish. Obviously everyone can do what they want, and I’m no JT or Liberal apologist, never was. Nor am I a caveman Con tuned into the social mores of 1925, or a neoliberal NDP trying to follow the Blair line of “social democracy” to get a look-in at the halls of power. But I do not see that either side in the SNC-L affair and follow-ons is occupied exclusively by saintly angels either. And the punditry/advocacy involved is over the top. That’s my opinion.

Here on ProgBlog, we have you 100% on one side because you say JT is a phoney, and Montreal Simon 100% the other side because who the hell knows for sure.

From my life experience, nobody is ever 100% correct, so you’ll excuse me if I look at both extreme, as I see it, sides with a certain amount of home-grown scepticism. In other words, my personal BS detector went off weeks ago. Neither of you is saving me from anything; I’ve got a brain, I can read, I can reason all by my little lonesome self. I never see much reasoning applied by you pundits that makes complete sense, merely tabloid-style headlines, hard advocacy for one side or the other, and a lofty disregard for anyone who should have the mere temerity to point out something that doesn’t bolster their point-of-view.

To me both bloggers’ gung-ho approach is quite unseemly, and I do not see where it gets us; only the blindly devoted fully agree with what’s being said on either side. Blaring foghorns both of you to my way of thinking. Living by the sea, I’ve heard them for decades in times of fog, and if you want to get some sleep, you learn to tune the sound out. Until morning when curiosity strikes once again.

Bill,

I don’t dispute your argument. It appears to be correct.

But on the other hand, I’ve seen people meet with party bag-persons to get themselves, or their spouses, named to the judiciary. I’ve also seen people lobbying cabinet ministers in the past, so in the interest of full transparency, I hope JWR will eventually respond to your comment.

The Liberal MPs, spin doctors and media friends hectoring from the sidelines are so blatantly full of sh!t. “Let the Justice committee do it’s work”. Followed by “Let the Ethics Committee investigate”. Now what? “Wait for retired Liberal Cabinet Minister Anne MacLellan to provide recommendations.” Your 9 Lives are up Justin. The only question remains is how many Liberal Lemmings are in the back of that 18-wheeler going over that cliff. Except Justin won’t be hitting the bottom below – he’s got a job waiting on the Board of SNC Lavalin.

What serious corporation would want someone with such seriously compromised tactical and strategic instincts as J Trudeau. He has limited contacts with world leaders to those who were just looking for photo-ops. He has alienated Saudi Arabia, China, and India among others. His only valuable marketable “skill” would be the advice he could give from his numerous dealings with Donald Trump.

His post-political life should be limited to celebrity spokesperson for the Katimavik program.

Well it’s eight feet high and rising
He got him a boat with a few good leaks
To his journo friends who kiss his feet
And it really doesn’t matter cause he’s dead meat
How high’s the water, Justin

How high’s the water,Justin?
Ten feet high and rising
How high’s the water, Justin?
Ten feet high and rising
Well he’s trying to fake it like he always has
He thinks they’ll buy it if he shakes his ass
But everyone knows he’s run out of gas
How high’s the water, Justin?

The very same Liberal Caucus members who are demanding Philpot and Wilson-Raybold speak – on a soap box, in the House, to the media; “shut up or put up” – are completely silent when the Justice Committee Liberals shut it down and refuse to “Let Her Speak”. And the Liberals vote not to strike up an investigation by the Ethics Committee/Commissioner. Isn’t it high time these spineless Liberals ask their Leader that its time he, as Prime Minister, “puts up or shuts up”? I’m getting confused with all the contradictions. If they want these women to speak, why don’t they demand their Liberal committee members Let Them Speak? Or simply tell Justin – time be lead by example and testify? Oh, and why hasn’t Justin condemned the leak about the confidential Supreme Court Judge nomination and vowed to “get to the bottom of it”?

The funny thing to me is it’s an arrogance similar to what Harper had: Harper was very cavalier about alienating significant swaths of the electorate, thinking (apparently) that he just had to play to the base to win. A shining example is Red Tories. Harper had barely veiled contempt for Red Tory/Blue Liberal types, and a Conservative party needs those people to form a winning coalition.

It’s not an exact analogy, but Trudeau seems very cavalier these days about pissing off all kinds of people (myself included) who might have been inclined to consider voting LPC this fall. Lavscam as an issue resonates a lot with people (a lot of them educated, professional etc.) who care about process, rule of law etc. It reminds me a bit of the Census issue with Harper — why unnecessarily and gratuitously piss off people whose votes you need?

Max says:

Doctor, you are right about one thing – your Harper – Trudeau analogy is not exact. Harper was anything but arrogant. But as a brilliant man and graduate of the London School of Economics, he had reason to be. But he wasn’t. He was polarizing, decisive, stubborn, nerdy and cold. But smart. Unlike Trudeau who was “born into it”. Harper has forgot more than Trudeau will ever know. Full disclosure – I’ve voted for all 3 parties. I will never vote Liberal as long as Trudeau is there.

Doug Brown says:

I don’t see any similarity. Harper was more aloof, along the lines of Trudeau Sr. He was usually the smartest person in the room and struggled to related to others. Trudeau Jr is simply incompetent to be in any position of authority. He can’t think on his feet and resorts to scripts when in a panic, often to the wrong scripts. Gerry Butts created the Justin Trudeau personal. Without him, JT would be nothing more than an middle aged frat boy.

Doc,

Is it possibly a combination of arrogance and entrenched entitlement? They get in and rationalize that they only got in because of their strategic mind and forget how the other guy badly screwed up to help pave the way…

I was nothing but Red Tory during my CPC years. No question we were at least frowned upon by the true believers.

Harper makes me laugh: how does he explain his previous political incarnation as a good Ontario-based federal liberal? Ditto for Kenney in Sask., à l’époque?

In addition, the mindset of these people is always give ’em a shovel and boy, will they ever just keep digging their political graves. They can’t seem to help themselves.

Trudeau watches an Indigenous woman get assaulted by one of his supporters and he proudly refers to it as “political discourse”.
I guess we just have to reflect on how she experienced her assault differently.

How can a government take borders and open them? Does that mean they were more secure under Harper or were they as “open” as they allegedly are now?





The Doctor says: 

March 29, 2019 at 12:13 pm

I’m not in favour of open borders either. I believe in immigration law. “Open borders” literally means you have no immigration law. The stuff that Scheer and those yellow vest people were saying and implying about the UN declaration was false and misleading.

What I’m against is lying and people who lie and mislead for partisan political purposes.






Joseph Taylor says: 

March 28, 2019 at 6:30 pm

Honestly, the only association I see between Andrew Scheer and the far-right is the media trying desperately to find a way to associate him with it by parsing every single thing he says or does through the lens of suspicion. Immigrant’s are the most conservative element in Canada and Andrew Scheer will not be prime minister in the fall unless he wins at least a plurality of immigrants in the 905 region this fall. Xenophobia is not a winning strategy for any party that wants to hold together a coalition of voters large enough to win an election.

May not be correct 4 years from now, 6-8 years from now, 10 years from now (who knows?) etc. etc. But we have a strong team and with people like Lisa Raitt, Michelle Rempel, Pierre Poilevere (who are all relatively young), and those who are recently elected like Michael Barrett (also relatively young) we have a bright future ahead with a government that would be stable, humbling, and dedicated to service!

There are also Blue Liberal/Red Tory types who have understandable concerns about how far to the right Sheer and his party are and are prepared to go.

The Carbon Tax stance is a perfect example. What if you’re a fiscal conservative social liberal who thinks we ought to be doing something about climate change?

Ever since Harper became leader, the CPC hasn’t been the most welcoming place for Red Tories or Blue Liberals to park their votes. And I say that as somebody who has been a pretty reliable Tory voter (albeit sometimes holding my nose while doing so).

Anyone?

You may tape if one party consents. She consented.

The consent must come from one of the people being recorded. You don’t get to count yourself as a consenting person in this case. Unfortunately for me, I’ve had a bad experience with this and learned the hard way.

It has been broadcast now – I just listened to the whole thing on the CBC:
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-justice-committee-documents-audio-1.5076563

How does that affect the legal situation, if it does? Does the fact that it was the CBC rather than JWR herself exonerate her?

Also, I’ve read that while it may be legal, the legal societies of both BC and Ontario regard one-sided recording as grounds for disbarment. Is that true?

Firstly, lets assume that JWR, in her capacity as 1) Minister of Justice, 2) Attorney general of Canada, 3) Crown Prosecutor in British Columbia, 4) a real, live Lawyer who knows something about the legalities around such recordings (apologies to Katie T with those pesky “legalities” in such matters). Now is not the time for arm-chair legal posers wading in with furrowed brow. Get over it or yourselves. (NB. Not sure if JWR was ever a drama teacher or snowboard instructor)

Vancouverois says:

You have a point – but it’s also obvious that JWR had very good reasons to feel it was necessary. And subsequent events have completely borne that out.

This clearly wasn’t the first time that she’d been subjected to outrageous political pressure to interfere. I can’t honestly blame her for wanting to have evidence to support her side, when she could clearly see that she was going to need it against the full weight of the Liberal establishment.

If I was going to assume… and I very much am… it may be a reference to alleged financial irregularities by the BMO on the Kinder Morgan TMX purchase and alleged attempts by the government to shield the BMO from said alleged irregularities.

There has been a very tiny bit of coverage from US sources on that allegation but none I’ve seen in Canadian media. Grain of salt worthy but it would certainly fit with the worldview being expressed by JT and company right now.

LPC never had intentions to build pipelines! It’s in their DNA to not build pipelines. Buy them yes to shut them down. After all the current KM pipe is old, will soon leak, and should be shut down. And moreover, Justin has said: ” We need to phase them out.” i.e. oil sands and their pipes!

She could not have been more clear. But the status of Ms. Wilson-Reybould in relation to the LSO is not clear to me (she was called under the Barrister’s Act), but the rules governing lawyers in Ontario (similar to elsewhere in Canada) provide: 

7.2-3 A lawyer shall not use any device to record a conversation between the lawyer and a client or another legal practitioner, even if lawful, without first informing the other person of the intention to do so.

No. He is not a member of the government. So the AG is not her lawyer.

JWR has been consulting with lawyers all along (but not Warren – we all know she hasn’t been consulting with Warren!) and I’m pretty sure one of them would have told her what she did was against the Barrister’s Act if what you are asking is true.

While I agree Wernick is at a disadvantage in this exchange because she could word things to enhance and/or protect her own reputation, I believe she did this only after repeated similar conversations.

So much for the PM’s assertion that sometimes people misconstrue what they are hearing and this was the case here.

I took a 3 week pause on this scandal. here’s what’s changed

– I’m no longer convinced that this whole scandal would have been avoided if JWR had horse traded SNC for elements of her agenda at Justice. JWR made the tough non-politician decision but didn’t resign because then she’d harm Trudeau. Politics at the c-suite is mostly horse trading exercises as we all are familiar on the inside circuit.

– I’m now MORE SO inclined to believe that the demotion was the trigger: JWR was worried about the Saturday Night Massacre (which went over Wernick’s head & mine). She was worried about her reputation since it was an obvious manipulation to support the DPA..,Too embarrassing to her character. She did not want to be a stooge, a trained seal, a loyal cabinet minister.

– It’s still the case then that this was triggered by JT’s cabinet shuffle, which means Scott Brison is to blame. Okay, I kid, I kid. But it is really unfortunate for the LPC as we need problem solvers more than ever.

Derrick says: 

March 29, 2019 at 8:24 pm

When she’s making the decision she’s AG but when she’s telling JT (or perhaps the Privy Council) that they are stepping over or near the line she’s giving advice. I understood that MOJ sends legal opinions to the Privy Council. Not much turns on it but I expect every lawyer paused on this because lawyers can’t record conversations with clients. I also expect that she took advice before releasing this.

Makes Wernick’s “I wasn’t wearing a wire” quite funny …

Vancouverois says:

“he doesn’t want to give tax credits so rich religious people can save $$ putting their kids in private religious schools.”

Catholics in most of Canada get their religious education publicly funded. As long as other faith groups have to pay out of pocket, tax credits are a viable solution to this inequity.

I went to the CTV website and listened to the whole conversation. Wow. Just wow.

This will be a watershed moment in Canadian politics, I imagine. To summarize the developments over the past 24 hours:
1. Various folks previously tried to suggest that JWR misunderstood “normal” conversations as political pressure. This recording completely destroys that narrative. Ergo, the PM, Wernick, and Butts are blatant liars.

2. The CEO of SNC tried to suggest that the company never advised the government that 9000 jobs were at risk, if the DPA wasn’t pursued. The email revealed yesterday destroys that narrative. Ergo, SNC and its CEO are blatant liars.

I’m not sure this government, under JT’s leadership, will make it to the election in the fall. I suspect the polling numbers will have them in 3rd place in a hurry.

From the very outset and throughout the conversation JWR told Wernick that she considered the conversation to be inappropriate, interference, illegal. Yet he pressed on. There is no way he can say he wasn’t aware of how she was receiving his requests/threats. She even used the term “Saturday Night Massacre”.

And it is incredibly unlikely that JT didn’t order him to make the call and imply the threat of firing.

Is anyone in cabinet or caucus going to the the Barry Goldwater thing and go to Sussex and tell him he hasn’t there support and must resign? Or are they and the party lemmings?

The Liberal Caucus members need to be vewy vewy caweful (channel your inner Elmer Fudd, if you’re old enough). Chretien would call then Nervous Nellies. Firstly, if the vote to expel Jody and Jane, they potentially have 2 very capable MPs outside the Liberal tent pissing in, whereas, even as bad as things have gotten, they’d be wise if they remain inside the Liberal tent pissing out. Before this plays out, they may need the integrity and gravitas that Jody and Jane have, an it is Justin who goes for a walk in the muck with his Birkenstoks.

This morning CBC reported the PMO states that Michael Wernick never informed them of the content of his telephone conversation with JWR. I predict their next statement will be that the PM never instructed Wernick to say what he did or how he said it, and that he did it on his own initiative – in other words, he went rogue. I wonder whether Wernick will meekly accept the role of fall guy.

Reply


Vancouverois says: 

March 30, 2019 at 3:12 pm

I don’t know if Wernick will let this slide – he seemed very self-important, and this accusation touches directly on his personal honesty and competence. Not that he can really claim to be honest now that his prevarications at the Justice Committee have been exposed… but I don’t think that will prevent him from defending himself against this particular charge.

Not that it matters, really. The idea that Wernick didn’t report on the conversation when that’s his whole job – and when in the call he explicitly says “I am going to have to report back” – is ludicrous in the extreme. Nobody is going to believe it. The most extreme Liberal partisans may pretend they do, if they don’t care about looking like dishonest fools – but that won’t actually convince anyone.

To my surprise, it looks like he may be playing ball with the PMO and taking the blame after all! Apparently his lawyer is now saying that he never told Trudeau about the call, because everyone was away for the holidays.

I don’t see how any of them can expect that to work given that Wernick himself emphasized in front of the Justice Committee that JWR could have contacted the PM at any time – and that the PM’s itinerary for December 20-22 shows several days of “private meetings”, as our host has pointed out on Twitter.

But hey, we all know by now that we can’t expect a viable PR strategy from these guys… just more colossal gaffes.

“What,” she asked, “if the opinion comes saying, ‘She can review it, but she shouldn’t,’ or simply, ‘She can’t review it’?”

“Mr. Butts stated, ‘It wouldn’t say that,’” Prince told JWR.

Prince remembered this very clearly, JWR said in her written submission to the justice committee, “because this response made her nervous.”

To what end?

You’ve changed the course of Canadian history. JT was on track to a second term (although maybe in a minority) given such a lackluster opposition. Now he’ll lose. Some PMs might come back from a deficit of this size–JC ran best as an underdog–but not this one. Was that your intent? Is a CPC majority a better outcome? Does it further the goals you entered politics to pursue?

Making a significant statement about the rule of law, and exposing JT’s contempt for it (“he wants to get this done…) is no small thing.

Was it enough?

Symmetry, certainly not by comparative analysis! Lets see if we were talking about the other 2 parties that run but are guaranteed never to win (by Bay street-naturally)…So that leaves the only other party viable to win and they did but —the board of CBC News and many others on (Bay street) don’t like the more apparent difference (or lack of symmetry) with the ultra corporate Dumpy Trumpy and Wall street’s control (now) over all..that is worth controlling….

So, is there symmetry on reporting the differences between these 2 parties…Lets see the Conservatives have a decade long track record and a CBC News documentary on their literally ‘tossed out’ qualified professionals (just because they were what ? Academics –yes and hold your breath–scientists that could blow–a crater thru Harper’s lazy and more dumb-down theory of perception over facts..And so these world-renowned professionals are fired..w/o grounds…so typical no may wee.
Next we have this asinine tryst about wee-more Neo-liberal Jody and how undemocratic it was to only allow her 4 hours to testify—When Baird saw to it in 2010 see (CTV June ) report on his bullying not only 3 ministerial staffers not to appear–but undermine our democratic House with Harper’s majority to force a ‘barring’ of their testimony to the (get this) oppositions Operations Committee in Parliament….How low can you blow toxic anti-legal and have an entire opposition show they have no ethics or more the moral of alley cats –None of which should ever be allowed (until properly neutered of all such dictatorial notions…Nes pas….?

As soon as the politicians set a precedent to allow for political interference in the legal system we are in trouble. They can stop prosecutions of their friends or direct prosecution of their enemies.

if Trudeau goes forward with this, then it is justified for Andrew Scheer to do exactly the same thing for his friends.

That protection of the rule of law and the constitution comes down to the personal integrity of the AG, Deputy AG, and DPP is a big problem for they call all be replaced.

But now we know who was telling the truth, and it ain’t Justin. And just so we’re all clear, The tape reveals Team Trudeau is concerned about the loss of 9000 jobs and SNC Lavalin moving out of Canada. JWR says “no, its not about jobs” and there will be no DPA. So, despite the “9000 JOBS Lost”, Wernick decides NOT to inform Justin. And Justin doesn’t ask. Something about vacation and Christmas. Oh, well. So many priorities. So much to remember.

Lastly, “the Prime Minister is firm about this… he’s in a mood…. its not good you’re at loggerheads…. he’s gonna find a way to get it done…. you have the tools, why won’t you use them…”. She saud No. No means no, right Justin? So he fired her and brought in Lametti. If there was no tape, Lametti would be giving that DPA to SNCL. And the spineless Liberal Caucus? They focus not on the truth of the tape, but that they feel she acted unethically by taping. They conveniently ignore what she was doing. She was standing alone against a corrupt Justin to protect the independence of the Prosecutorial Office entrenched in the Canadian Constitution. My point is, that tape is damn inconvenient ain’t it.

I may be an engineer and not a lawyer, so this sleaze affects me differently. To me it’s all about different issues.

For me it’s the Moral Hazard that the Government of the day is telling Engineering firms. That you are allowed to get away with illegal behaviour, and the Law is simply lip service.

My experience from working in Toronto to working in Alberta, is that in Alberta if a company stresses safety, than it is serious about safety. Report all incidences and near misses, no hiding safety infractions. I can not say the same from my experience in heavy industry in Ontario.

That is why I also think it as Western Canadian values vs Eastern Canadian Values. Where eastern Canada believes this behaviour is simply the cost of doing business. (This is my perception from working on both sides of Canada)

I beleive this is the reason why Trudeau’s popularity has been hurt most in BC. (His popularity was already too low in the Prairies to see large changes in the polls.)

To me it is also about protecting what I perceive as eastern Canada’s economic interest over Western Canadas growing economic influence. As a portion of SNCs share of government contracts would go to Western Canadian firms. Since Western Canada is the growing powerhouse for Engineering Procurment and Construction (EPC) firms.

Western Canada’s largest skyscraper is named after an engineering EPC after all.

So to me it’s all about the Engineering Profession and letting everyone in the industry know that the Law is the Law is the Law. Illegal behaviour will not be tolerated.

No more, “we fired the bad actors, so let us resume business as usual.”

I mean what is the point of even having a House that debates and then votes on legislation…If anti-Constitutional idiots elected, do more to destroy any opposition and undoing our laws…why is this not discussed because these are the yahoos who will again do all to dismantle our democracy as they supported and worked to do under Harper….?

And our totally supportive media CBC News, cares about the truth as much as they care about doing proper journalistic work…Imagine, laughing because you are paid to at minimum know what NAFTA is and how the ISDS affects the (public) your employers …Nah, let them pay but we’ll make fun of our ignorance of what the initials ISDS –even mean…How gross, how irresponsible…Privatizing CBC is long overdue.
Bottom line, Trudeau has stood up and unlike any of the cowards from the conservative party, he said …go ahead and say your piece..Jody..
Whereas Harper and the Conservatives –BARRED —three ministerial staffers from simply answering questions of the Operations Committee in Parliament…To the extent of bullying the House and then appearing instead of these same staffers…How that for a lesson in no-democracy from these hypocrite Conservatives….scammers by trade and the CBC is on my radar for no more public funding —period.

Ain’t gonna work Margaret.
Every major print and media outlet is on this, the damage is done, not by the evil dark prince Stephen Harper but by an arrogant and possibly our country’s worst PM ever.
Fake, phoney, arrogant, mean spirited and lacking intelligence.
That’s our current PM.
Easily fixed Margaret, but it’s gonna take more then ” but harper”.

This was started before Trudeau (and no I’m not defending him, just arguing that he unwisely is behaving according to the rules the previous government established with their politicization of the judicial appointments process, the attempted removal of judicial discretion with mandatory minimums, the blatant ampaign attacks on “Liberal” judges and the harassment of the chief justice of the Supreme court.) Scheer’s party wrote the book on this stuff and they poisoned the well. They won’t win the next election because in the campaign voters will be reminded of their hypocrisy over and over again. I think the NDP has a shot.

The PM is going to expel them?
No, thats not how he works.
He has some pressure brought to bear on the caucus and then he makes them vote them out.
Don’t you remember? He doesn’t take responsibility for any of the tawdry stuff.
But here’s the rub.
Before they pass judgement on their soon to be cashiered MP’s will Jody be allowed to speak to caucus?
And if so will it be to remind her colleagues why they are being asked to oust two MP’s?
And then ask her colleagues if they think this will make the story go away?
Then the biggest if, will the vote be unanimous or not?

I see it rather differently. The AG is not just in charge of the justice system. It’s the AG’s job to provide advice & counsel to the government. It’s a double role.

It’s clear to me that JWR was unfamiliar with the latter aspect of her job. She misinterpreted a simple request for a more detailed legal opinion as a threat to judicial independence.

JT was having trouble glad handing SNC. He wanted his lawyer to help bolster his negotiating position. He wanted an analysis so he could credibly say “I tried everything” – and even said “If you don’t give me a memo, I’ll have to hire Beverly McLachlin”. And that sounded like meddling? McLachin wasn’t going to give him a rubber stamp to make a deal.

JT merely wanted to be able to say to SNC that he considered all options.

JWR did not understand it was her job to help JT consider all options.

The Canadian Criminal Justice System has historically catered to the moneyed class via fees for service. The poor in Canada have historically been given the shaft by the so-called Criminal Justice System to date. At no time in Canadian historiography do we evidence a fair & just system of jurisprudence. Aboriginal Canada has historically been shafted by the Government of Canada too.

The list of less than fair outcomes is long in our shared history. The Canadian Criminal Justice System is by no means fair or impartial when it comes to doling out jurisprudence to the poor of Canada.

First Nations reserves are still in third world conditions for septic systems & potable water. That should have been outlawed years ago IMO.

They say desperate times require desperate measures. There’s a lot of truth to this re JWR. She was being set up to go rogue and undermine the rule of law. The pressure was relentless and thuggish. Knowing full well about the Machiavellian nature of Trudeau, Butts and others, she resorted to gathering evidence which is impossible to dispute. She did the right thing, the brave thing and the only thing she could have done.

Your meetings are all praise no criticism. Then when the inevitable happens you play it for your employment lawyer. Lawyer says that as long as the conversation is one on one in a private meeting that’s legal. Then the company pays. True story.

I listened to the entire call and a few things stood out.

1) The media reports had led me to believe that JWR was the decision maker – as opposed to being the person in a position to override a recommended decision from someone else.

2) I was troubled by the tone of the conversation, length, and repeated pressure during this conversation.

I am not surprised JWR taped the conversation. In my opinion, it sounded like a last chance to fall in line, before being fired/demoted. It also sounded like there had been many similar conversations before.

Obviously the PMO has all the power, but this issue has really brought home to me that the makeup of the government, whether 50% female or not, 50% minority or not, is irrelevant. Although I don’t care about the race or sex of MPs, I have cared about their previous experience and qualifications. But apparently MPs and heads of departments have 0% autonomy and so it is irrelevant who they are and what they bring to the table.

So in future I will be basing my vote for this federal Liberal government entirely on who the leader is. What a shame.

” The media reports had led me to believe that JWR was the decision maker – as opposed to being the person in a position to override a recommended decision from someone else.”

Exactly. This is a part of the story that many people don’t seem to understand. JWR wasn’t making the decision to prosecute; she was respecting the independently-made decision of someone else whose job it is to decide these things.

While she did have the power to override that decision, it could only be justified in the most extraordinary of circumstances. She’d effectively be saying that the current Director of Public Prosecutions must resign.

I still can’t find an answer to this question. Why was Butts so convinced that Ex-Chief Justice Bev M. would not rule out JWR interfering as he told her C of S? Had they already talked to her. What if any was her involvement?
https://nationalpost.com/opinion/christie-blatchford-the-jody-wilson-raybould-solution

‘Prince asked a hypothetical.

“What,” she asked, “if the opinion comes saying, ‘She can review it, but she shouldn’t,’ or simply, ‘She can’t review it’?”

“Mr. Butts stated, ‘It wouldn’t say that,’” Prince told JWR.

Prince remembered this very clearly, JWR said in her written submission to the justice committee, “because this response made her nervous.”

I bet it did: It’s not every day that high-ranking government officials talk about a former chief justice with such overt familiarity and with such a casual sense of ownership.’

I love how during the conversation — the whole purpose of which was to put pressure on JWR and interfere in an independent process — Wernick periodically would say “but I’m not interfering” or words to that effect.

It’s like a mob enforcer sticking a gun in your mouth while saying “but I’m not threatening you.”

Or rather, the PM could advise the Governor-General to do so. The law states clearly that it has no effect on the GG’s perogatives, which include calling an election.

While she could theoretically refuse, citing the law, the convention is that the GG does what the PM asks. That isn’t an absolute, but it is extremely unlikely that any GG would say no unless there were some truly overbearing reason.

It has nothing to do with her future hopes (or not) of further political office. She has an obligation to keep the secrets that were entrusted to her, no matter what changes of her status may occur afterward.

Trudeau is his own worst enemy. Paradoxically his love of being in public where he’s fawned over runs contrary to his limited ability to work with others-share power. Like a pathological narcissist, his inflexibility robs him from the bounty of reaching a well thought out consensus via a team effort.

History is full of accounts where authoritarian personalities have been crushed by an unassuming person. Perhaps the most infamous is the narrative of David and Goliath.

Justice – which Justin Trudeau hadn’t mentioned all that often during his three-and-a-half-years in the big chair – was now super-duper important. It was everything. It was a “file” that “has always been one of particular importance and interest to me. It’s always been very close to my heart.”

His heart! The mind reels, at such times. Our souls swoon.

So, stay with me, here. Just for a minute.

At that moment, justice was a baseball, kind of, but in a good way. In an instant, we were collectively whisked back to the Nineties, to that iconic scene in Field of Dreams – the one where Kevin Costner asks his deceased Dad if he wants to play catch, and every grown man in the theatre starts to sniffle. Except, in Justin’s case, the baseball was justice – stamped Rule of Law, so we don’t miss the point – and he and Pierre were lobbing it back and forth, so great was their love of justice.

That’s what the young Trudeau was after, anyway. That’s what he wanted to evoke. Justice, Dad, better times.

Except, you know: nobody believes it. Nobody believes him, either. Two-thirds of Canadians, say the pollsters, are like those folks in Field of Dreams who keep showing up at Kevin Costner’s farm and they don’t see a damn thing. They don’t see anything magical or wonderful or poetic. They just see what is really there.

Which, in the LavScam case, is a seething, stinking dumpster overflowing with lies, and cover-ups, and smears. And, standing beside it all, is a Prime Minister who doesn’t seem so cool and hip anymore. He just looks like another grasping, grimy politician, one who will say and do anything to save his hide.

Because he’s losing. An Angus Reid poll, released Thursday, suggested he now may be as many as ten percentage points behind Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives nationally. And, as my smart NDP pal Karl Belanger reminded me, Trudeau’s personal approval numbers now lag behind another politician: Donald Trump.

And it is all because of justice.

Distilled down to its base elements, you see, LavScam is about justice. Not 9,000 jobs that SNC-Lavalin’s CEO says were never in jeopardy. Not Article Five of the OECD anti-bribery convention, which Trudeau’s government has violated. Not anything else: justice.

In our system of justice, no one – not even a Prime Minister – is allowed to ring up a judge or prosecutor and tell them what to do. That is against the law. It is obstruction of justice. It is the absence of justice.

Also unjust: the decision of someone on Team Trudeau to violate the sacrosanct judicial nomination process, simply to get back at former Attorney-General Jody Wilson Raybould. To do this, one of Trudeau’s faceless factotums leaked secret information about a Supreme Court of Canada nominee to compliant reporters at the Canadian Press and CTV News.

The nominee, who Wilson-Raybould reportedly preferred, was a social conservative, the leaker hissed. And Jody Wilson-Raybould favoured him – and Justin Trudeau opposed him, because he was insufficiently progressive, said the leaker.

Except: it wasn’t true. It was a lie. The judge was a moderate. And he wasn’t dropped from Justin Trudeau’s list – he removed himself from it, to care for a wife suffering from breast cancer.

So, is that justice? Is that just? Is it acceptable to further wound a family battling cancer – just to defame an indigenous woman who got a little too uppity?

But Jody Wilson-Raybould isn’t the only indigenous woman Justin Trudeau holds in contempt. No, there are others, as it turns out.

This week, the mask slipped yet again, and we saw Justin Trudeau mocking a young indigenous woman at a Liberal Party event in Toronto.

As his audience of well-to-do white men laughed, Justin Trudeau jeered an indigenous female protestor, saying “thanks for your donation” as she was hustled away by his hulking bodyguards.

She was there to protest the mercury poisoning of her people at Grassy Narrows, which Justin Trudeau had solemnly promised to remedy. And about which he has done precious little.

“Thanks for your donation.” Is that the “real change” Justin Trudeau said he’d give Canadians in 2015? Is that his promised reconciliation with indigenous people? Is that in any way just, or justice?

You know the answer already.

And you also know that Justin Trudeau wouldn’t know “justice” if it bit him on his privileged white ass","<div class=""articlecontent"">

JWR, and Jane Philpott, appear to have grossly over-estimated the morals of the Liberal Party.

They likely suspected their colleagues would have sided with them in their drive to maintain integrity. Unfortunately, it appears the virtually every MP fell on the wrong side of the ethical line. I suspect they know that an apathetic public is likely to forgive Trudeau, because his qualities are little changed from what they were 4 years ago – namely that he has nice hair.

I just listened to CTV talking about the notes Gerry Butts released.

I find it odd that he suddenly comes up with “relevant” notes only after JWR releases notes etc. It begs the question, why not just open everything up to a public inquiry then? Clear the air, so to speak.

Is there something else we don’t know about they don’t want to see the light of day?

I don’t know Gerry, or that much about him. My impressions so far, after watching him testify to the JC and now this, is that he is a somewhat slippery fellow.

But that’s just me..

Lately I’ve been wondering what PET would think of his eldest son in all of this. I’ve read that PET was somewhat disappointed that JT hadn’t inherited his intellect – apparently he wanted his teenage son to read literature and philosophy as a teenager, as he had done, but JT only read comic books.

Once bit, twice shy goes the old adage. And the imposter has bit us countless times. So what’s changed?

For two years a proponderance of pundits looked the other way and only a few were strong enough and ethical enough to swim against the tide. But now things have reversed and the imposter’s mask has been ripped off his face for the entire nation to see. And this is what your excellent article has done-ripped the imposter’s mask off and exposed a personality that manipulates, cons, and deceives.

Well done, Mr. Kinsella.

That’s the thing. None of these people had any more right to be calling her and telling her what to do than you or I.

It was clear from the call that Wernick didn’t understand what she was saying. He didn’t understand that JWR was accusing him and the PMO of interfering with the course of justice. Wernick kept bringing it back to the fact that she wouldn’t be interfering or obstructing justice if she just did what they wanted. And that was obviously the message coming from the PMO. These people seem to be a level below in understanding of where I would have thought they would be.

I don’t think it’s that Wernick and the PMO didn’t understand.

It’s that they just didn’t care.

They (still) haven’t bothered to read their own Legislation that they sneakily passed in the 2018 Budget Implementation Omnibus Bill. I guess that’s what happens when the “Justice” Committee can’t even be bothered to study Justice legislation.

I am thinking that JT and the PMO were setting up JWR.
If for some reason the DPA blew up and embarrassed the Liberals, then JT would say it was all JWRs decision.

So let me get this straight?
If a caucus member makes an ethical violation they should be kicked out of the liberal caucus.
What happens after the fifth ethical violation?

3 points about Butts’ “notes”:1. It confirms everything ⁦@Puglaas⁩ has said.
2. PMO having verbatim transcripts of her is OK, but not the reverse? Why?

Butts’ disclosure of detailed notes taken without @Puglaas’ consent has torpedoed the “we don’t take notes” claim PMO/PCO had taken in the Vice-Admiral Norman case. Blew it to smithereens. @jdsnowdy @HeneinHutchison #LavScam #cdnpoli

Some members decided to call an emergency meeting, because they didn’t want to have JWR and JP in the meeting on Wednesday.

Also, throwing them out on Wednesday would have been bad optics, since it’s would conflict with the message of the “Daughters Of The Vote” event that is happening then (https://www.daughtersofthevote.ca/). Of course, this has only ensured that the ejections will be featured in all of tomorrow’s headlines. Idiots.

That said, they *should* have been voted out formally. See this thread from Michael Chong…

As much as we are all aghast at the LPC, is voting Green really a good idea? Elizabeth May has enjoyed the luxury of being a sideshow single-issue candidate for her entire career. She may be charismatic, but would you trust her and the Greens as the economic stewards of the country? As the country’s representative on the global stage?

I suppose voting Green as a protest vote is one approach, but that’s going to deliver the seat to another party in each riding (except perhaps a select few in BC).

Agreed. Those thinking about voting Green might get what we have here in BC. Greens propping up a NDP gov’t which is in bed with the taxi vote meaning no Uber in BC despite that the majority of BCers WANT ride sharing!
Also, Greens causing NDP to shut down Transmountain pipe with BC having the highest gas prices in Canada and North America!

Experience or lack thereof is not necessarily the problem. Some people can have outstanding political instincts with little experience, and in reality, having some people coming from outside the hyperpartisan bubble can be helpful to the whole team in bringing in more perspectives to the table.

With respect to George Conway in the good ol’ USA, it looks like Canada has her own shit show in a dumpster fire going on in Ottawa!

I would literally do anything humanly and legally possible to sink Justin Trudeau and the incompetent LPC MPs who are supporting the removal of ethical and honest MP’s to protect a corrupt PM and PMO and an even more corrupt Quebec corporation. Anything that is except vote for that right wing fundie, Andrew Scheer. Looks like its vote NDP for me, federally. And I am a card carrying Liberal.

Now that our PM has done everything in his power to ensure that he, the PMO, the Liberal Party, and indeed Canada have international reputations even dirtier than the corrupt SNC Lavalin (and that’s saying something!!), how in hell can you blame the Chinese for using billions of dollars of Canadian canola imports to extort the political interference they require to resolve their own Chinese national’s legal problems on Canadian soil? Now that the Chinese canola market has been shit-canned, I suspect Western Canadian farmers’ aren’t impressed with having their international commodities foot the bill for the PM’s domestic corruption here at home in the service of SNCLavalin.

Time for the PM to resign along with his coterie of corrupt supporters. It”ll take a lot of bleach to get the stench out of the PMO after his tenure.

And JWR, and Jane Philpott, YOU ROCK!! Don’t let the corrupt bastards get you down. I feel that I along with millions of other Canadians owe you both a debt we can never repay. Thanks for your integrity and honesty. Thanks for caring enough to expose the depths of the corruption in this particular PMO. Your light will always shine. A truthtelling politician seems like a complete oxymoron, especially in these times, so it makes perfect sense that the exposed, corrupt politicians in the PMO and Liberal Caucus shit their pants and banished the truthtellers.

As a conservative, I am delighted by the whole chain of events so far. If Justin had any decency he would lawyer up and resign. Kicking JWR and Dr. Philpott from caucus, actually signals he wants to run as PM in the upcoming election! That’s hilarious.
The only hope the Liberals had was Justin resigning and one of those women assuming leadership f the Liberal party of Canada, and they would have won in a landslide. Ironically, a lot of Canada would be behind them, except a lot of Liberals, who burnt that bridge down.

I guess we’ll never know because Harper didn’t obstruct justice. In fact, his biggest scandal was his chief of staff paying back taxpayers money for a senator that Harper wanted abolished in the first place. In the end the senator was laughably cleared of wrongdoing.

And what did his chief of staff say about it:“My actions were intended solely to secure the repayment of funds, which I considered to be in the public interest, and I accept sole responsibility.”

Let’s contrast that with what the Liberals are doing… I guess they weren’t lying when they said they would do things differently than Harper…

Has there been a lower point in Canadian politics?

One party led by a fatuous, vacuous, former drama teacher without any accomplishment of note to his career before his being elected, other than being the (rich & privileged) son of a (rich & privileged) former Prime Minister.

Another party led by a former insurance salesman without any accomplishment of note to his career before being elected, and backed by a caucus of similarly unaccomplished simpletons who wouldn’t be able to last 10 minutes in the private sector… despite being the so-called champions of the private sector.

A third party led by “socialist” who was raised in a bubble as the rich and privileged kid of a psychiatrist, sent to private schools in the US, drives sports cars, wears Rolexes and designer suits and has no experience of the work your average union worker even does.

A fourth party led by a woman, another “socialist”, without any accomplishment of note in her career, except managing to get herself elected at the great expense of efforts to get other members of her party elected, of whom the grassroots of her own party have a strong dislike.

And a fifth party, a one-man vanity project, led by a “libertarian” who embraces the very un-libertarian ideas of tightly restricted immigration and plays footsies with racists and their discussions about “cultural values”.

It’s a disaster. We are headed for break-up. Trudeau can do this because he knows he’ll get re-elected, because the majority of the electorate are complacent. Once he gets back in, expect Western separatism to surge, expect even pockets of rural Ontario to explode. This experiment is not working because we, as a country, are content to tolerate morons and undistinguished persons populating our political class.

May be time to turn the heat up on members of the Liberal caucus to get them to wake up. From what I could tell a number of them were panic stricken and certainly down trodden after JWR and JP were ejected last night. The inner conflict some must be feeling must be intense wondering who is next now that they realize the consequences of any dissent. Wondering what JT has on them that’s preventing them from standing for the truth? And, what if anything SNC-Lavalin may have on him?

I doubt JT has anything on the Liberal MPs – I think they’re supporting him because they know he got them elected and they want to get re-elected really badly. Lose the next election, and they’ll have to say good-bye to all the lovely perks of being an MP, including the pension plan. Now I think it’s more than probable that SNC has something on JT – why else would he go to so much trouble for the company?

And what of the dishonourable Sheila Copps? She has the same mentality as many despots. In Cuba one can’t criticize the regime without being visited by the rapid response brigade and perhaps tossed into a political prison. Stalin sent critics to a gulag. Pol Pot executed them. These are the boil lancers whom Copps shares company.

It’s somewhat gratifying to see her disgracing herself so thoroughly – she’s been making comments that she would have condemned as viciously sexist and racist if they’d come from Reformers back in the 90s – but she’s a has been. She is irrelevant.

Only speaking truth wielding more power can win, but unfortunately after winning, that power can corrupt. A rare human can handle both. We need such a leader please.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you,” Jody Wilson-Raybould pleaded with her caucus colleagues, in a letter written hours before they were to pass sentence on her, “is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.”

But they made that choice long ago. They knew what kind of party they wanted to be a part of from the moment they accepted their nominations; indeed, were they not the type of person that party attracts they would not have been recruited for it. It is the kind of party, and person, that unquestioningly puts loyalty to party before principle — and mercilessly punishes those who do not.

So on the question of whether to expel the former minister of justice and attorney general — along with the former Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott — for the crime of denouncing the attempt, by the prime minister and senior government officials, to interfere with a criminal prosecution, there could have been little doubt how they would vote.

Whether they chose to shoot the messengers so spontaneously, over Justin Trudeau’s objections, as some reports have claimed — they were “determined to take the matter into their own hands,” according to a Canadian Press story, as if MPs were so eager to prove their obedience to the leader as to be willing to defy him — or whether they did so under orders doesn’t much matter. The rotting of the soul is the same either way.

We can now see, if it were not already apparent, the moral compass by which the prime minister and his caucus steer. The scandal in the SNC-Lavalin affair is, by this reckoning, not the months-long campaign to subvert the independence of the attorney general and, through her, to force the independent director of public prosecutions to drop charges of fraud and corruption against a long-time Liberal party contributor, but the opposition to it.

Traditional political theory teaches that the executive branch of government is responsible to the legislative. It is now clearer than ever that the reverse more nearly applies: members of the Liberal caucus plainly see it as their role, not to hold the government to account, but rather their fellow MPs — on behalf of the government. When wrongdoing by those high in government is alleged by a pair of whistleblowers, their first thought is to root out the whistleblowers.

Even when presented with incontrovertible evidence, in the form of an audio recording, that the clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, threatened the former attorney general with dismissal if she did not bend to the PM’s will, and that she repeatedly and explicitly protested against this “political interference” — on both points contrary to his testimony before a parliamentary committee — the prime minister and his camp followers profess themselves outraged, not at what the tape reveals, but that it exists.

No such outrage attended the release of a near-verbatim transcript of a later conversation between the former attorney general and the prime minister, based on notes taken by a person who was not even (so far as she was aware) privy to the call: the prime minister’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts. Why is a surreptitiously obtained transcript (which confirms, not confounds, her testimony) acceptable, while a surreptitiously obtained tape is not? The objection would appear to be that the latter is more accurate.

So the charge is a pretext. What has agitated Liberal MPs is not the former attorney general’s recording of a conversation she correctly anticipated would be improper and could have guessed would be denied, or her failure to alert the prime minister at whose behest it had taken place (and who could not fail to have been informed of its contents), but rather that she has contradicted and embarrassed the leader.

Or rather no: I suspect what truly outrages them is the sight of a person of conscience, unwilling to sacrifice her principles so readily on the altar of partisanship. For those who can still remember what that was like, it must be deeply shaming. For the rest, there is only one principle — blind loyalty to the leader — in which cause they are prepared to sacrifice any number of colleagues.

We should understand, not only how noxious this is, but how unusual. Only in Canada can you be kicked out of the party for disobeying the leader — because only in Canada has the party been so wholly subsumed by the leader, to the point that it exists more or less as an extension of his persona. The prime minister of Great Britain has suffered multiple coup attempts, without any such purges. Because in Britain it is understood that the leader serves the party, rather than the other way around.

Yet it is exactly that sort of leader-dominated, centralized politics that created this mess. Only a leader who was effectively accountable to no one could have so lost sight of the relevant ethical boundaries as to attempt to shut down a prosecution — for any reason, let alone the nakedly partisan purposes alleged. Only a leader surrounded by sycophants could have imagined that the past seven weeks of denial, deflection and smears could succeed in rescuing his reputation.

Or perhaps that is not the point. It is often said that the coverup is worse than the crime. Worse than a coverup, however, is the kind of open attempt to confuse the issue we have been witnessing. Since his initial, lawyerly non-denial, the prime minister has not much bothered to pretend he did not do what he is accused of — he merely insists there was nothing wrong with it. The object: to corrupt, not just the administration of justice, but our collective sense of right and wrong.

Still, it’s hard to see what is accomplished by this latest bout of thuggery — not only expelling Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, but revoking their nominations. It seems to be motivated by little more than sheer delight in retribution: vindictiveness for vindictiveness’s sake.

Sadly it is our very (supposedly ‘democratic ‘) system of government based on power centred at the top that inherently breeds the corruption we repeatedly witness. The system itself is broken! The entire system of governance needs to be re-thought. We need a totally transparent non-hierarchical system where every individual takes personal responsibility and the outcomes meet the highest and best good of all.

Ms. Wilson-Reybould and Dr. Philpott had to be removed from the Liberal caucus. They had demonstrated, through their actions, that their standards were too high. If they weren’t, then every time a member of the Liberal caucus walked into a caucus meeting, they would be reminded of how low their own standards are. That could “trigger” questions about their self-esteem, and that could lead to allegations of bullying … and bullies are not acceptable in the Liberal caucus.

So looking forward to the election campaign, JT’s inevitable speech with a tear in his eye and that infuriating cadence, how sometimes things get messy, good people get hurt, and though we regret it, we always had to keep in mind the best interests of the country. Which is to say, only us Liberals and me in particular, can prevent the return of the evil Harper-ites, who would do so much worse than we ever did. You have to excuse our actions because they were done only to keep something even worse from happening. Canada cannot stand for the Conservatives holding complete control… blah blah blah blah.

Changing the rules of the game to discourage the rabid partisanship and prevent any of these clowns from having complete control is the only way these situations will be avoided. Oh right, that electoral reform thing that was jettisoned the moment they realized they could keep complete control…

I wonder if the Liberal PM was a Justine and not a Justin if this whole SNC-Lavalin debacle (left over with multiple flaws, nasty secret deals etc from the former PMO of the horrific Harper years of power) would have been handled very differently. Yes, I am referring to the Canadian political ‘Old Boys Club’ of mean spirited, insular & misogynistic attitudes which are still entrenched in our Houses of Parliament and Senate chamber. Even our so called ‘feminist’ PM Trudeau is still very much part of the OB Club even though he proclaims to be extremely progressive when it comes to moving towards an equal or 50/50 split in male and female cabinet members. Clearly we can see from the undisclosed taping incident that the women in this cabinet can make bad decisions just as well as their male counterparts. But I question if these had been two males, acting as outspoken ‘rebels’, whether they would have been treated like evil pariahs of the Liberal party and ousted. The picture in my head, regarding two male Liberal members in the dog house, is one of being chewed out for 20 minutes in the PMO where they would swear never to do anything like that ever again – cross their precious hearts! I can even hear the clinking of the ice in those whiskey glasses and the hearty slaps on the backs!

As Coyne points out, this dictatorship-masking-as-democracy is unique to Canada. Yet it is not unique to the current administration.

Unlike the U.S. or the UK, most of our elected MPs (and provincial MLAs) might as well be trained monkeys. They always vote the party line. They always speak the party talking points in the media. JWR and JP are notable in part because they are so different than every other MP, from every party.

As much as there is a lot to critique about the U.S. system, at least Senators and members of Congress can openly debate the policies of the President, without getting kicked out of the party. That is healthy democracy. Not the cult of personality that has embodied all Canadian administrations for decades.

This also demonstrates what I and a lot of others find so disgusting about the party system: the fact that it leads to this “party over country” mentality (but of course party partisans don’t see this). Note all the times these douchebags mentioned “the team” yesterday, like being a “team player” is the most important thing in the world.

I note that that was also the mantra of the Nixon White House. ’nuff said.

There is likely no precedence for this, but might Andrew Scheer be willing to entertain the notion of offering both JWR and JP some temporary accommodation on his front bench for say 10 days or so? Given what has transpired, could there conceivably be a more intriguing possibility than watching these two competent, confident and capable communicators being provided with the opportunity to pose some poignant and topical questions directly across the floor to Mr. Trudeau during Question Period!?!

I think that would taint them both in the eyes of the electorate – it would lend strength to the absurd notion that they were secret Conservative agents all along. (Insane, I know; but there’s no shortage of Trudeau cultists who are pushing it.)

If all three opposition parties agreed to let them have time, maybe it would be different.

Question Period is a circus anyway, though. I’m not sure it’s worth pursuing there. Better to keep the issue alive in the media.

It took a while but here goes: the problem with Coyne, Kinsella, yours truly and countless others is that we look at this from a rule of law perspective and whether illegal or improper conduct has been committed.

But that’s not now, nor has it ever been the name of this game. To wit: that meeting of the Ontario caucus tells you all you need to know about caucus and their glorified perspective. They bombarded JP with you are going to make me lose my job! But that was nothing but self-serving code. This is what ALL OF THEM IN CAUCUS think who voted to oust JWR and JP: nothing, positively nothing, is more important to me on God’s green earth than to maintain pension access. I don’t give a shit about the job. Not really. All I live for is my entitled access to a golden parachute. That is now and will always remain my only consideration. I don’t care if the devil himself was leader — just don’t monkey with my sense of entitlement and my well-deserved pension! Nothing but nothing comes between me and my cash.

That’s their mentality. And nothing else. Pure, naked self-interest, greed and self-centered pre-occupation.

Solid and well written. As good an argument as there is for an end to political parties in the parliamentary system as there is (either by getting rid of the FPTP electoral system or just outright banning parties). I wouldn’t, however, be holding the current UK parliament as an paragon of democracy tho. May has lost how many ‘meaningful votes’ now? Endured how many ministerial resignations? In earlier times an honourable government would have resigned. Yet there she is. I guess there is no honour anywhere anymore (also on that note shouldn’t the Queen be summoning the PM and requesting her resignation at this point?). Parliament can’t even force her out on a non-confidence vote because the self-serving extreme portions of the Tory party want to keep her there to endure more Brexit punishment. Governance everywhere is a complete shambles. Reduced to ruin by self-serving, sniveling non-entities and clapping seals. New Zealand may be the only exception.

He’s a liar with a highly seductive persona. Like a vampire, whom you’re not suppose to look into it’s eyes, the Imposter has a similar effect. Try looking away from the visual and just listen to him. With hearing more in tune, you begin to notice things. Most good liars try to follow a narrative that boarders on something truthful. Trudeau attempts this, but his comments betray him. Listen to his” um, um, um ” a tell tale sign that he’s creating something in order to escape.

The pressure won’t end because too many influential people are on to him and are kicking his ass.

462,Warren Kinsella,My latest in the Sun: the Trudeau cult,2019-04-03 13:15:00,Warren,,"Dear Liberals:
This is an open letter to all of you. I want to start it by telling you why I became a lawyer.

It was a movie, called The Oxbow Incident. It was a Western, released some 75 years ago, and it starred Henry Fonda. It was about how a mob hanged a man. The wrong man.

At the end, the lynch mob all gather in a bar, and Henry Fonda reads a letter the dead man wrote to his wife. Here is some of it.

“Law is a lot more than words you put in a book, or judges or lawyers or sheriffs you hire to carry it out. It’s everything people ever have found out about justice and what’s right and wrong,” Fonda says, reading the dead man’s letter. “It’s the very conscience of humanity. There can’t be any such thing as civilization unless people have a conscience, because if people touch God anywhere, where is it except through their conscience? And what is anybody’s conscience, except a little piece of the conscience of all men that ever lived?”

That speech is why I became a lawyer. What Henry Fonda said, in a long-ago Western. What he said about justice, and how it is the thing that makes us human.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who I have never met – and Jane Philpott, who I have – remind me a little bit of Henry Fonda, reading that dead man’s letter. They seem to believe, as I do, that if we do not have justice, we have not much left. They proudly gave up everything for it, after all.

After what you Liberals did, I suppose you are expecting me to liken you to a lynch mob. And, it is true: you were a bit like that.

Hell, you expelled Jody Wilson-Raybould on the pretext of a making a tape on which a powerful man threatens her. When, a few days later, the Prime Minister of Canada spoke to Wilson-Raybould about why she’d been demoted – and he didn’t bother to tell her his Principal Secretary was secretly listening in. Keeping a record of what was said.

To use against her.

But, still, I will not call you a lynch mob. What you are, more accurately, is a group of people who belong to a cult. It is not a political party anymore. It is a cult.

It’s kind of understandable, although not ever forgivable. Justin Trudeau, to most of you, is the Liberal Party. He lifted the party from third place to first, and he propelled most of you into power. He made three big promises.

He said he’d be a feminist. He said he’d reconcile with indigenous people. And he said he’d bring back ethical government.

Well, he lied. His willingness to brutalize Wilson-Raybould, Philpott and Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes – and to cut a sweetheart deal for a sleazy donor – showed him to be none of those things. It showed him to be what this newspaper memorably called him this week: the fake feminist.

But still you follow him. Still you belong to his cult. Even when you know he has done wrong.

And so, you will end like all cults do: you will go down with your leader. You will perish with him, and you all richly deserve it.

Because voters understand – as they did at the end of The Oxbow Incident – that justice is all that keeps us from devolving into a lynch mob.

Which, as I say, you all resemble quite a bit.

And for which you will all pay.

Sincerely,

Warren","<div class=""articlecontent"">

I have a friend. His kid was a drug addict. Kid was clean for a while – turned up one day a bit the worse for wear. Dad said “You’re on the drugs again aren’t you”. The kid said “Well you know how it is dad, I have these friends.” The old man, my friend, got emotional. did the never-darken-my-door routine. So the kid went off and killed himself. Heavy.

I sent a note to my MP, about a month ago, to think about stepping away from her party to become an independent. I told her I would like to show support for the two women that were standing up for justice and she could too. I added that I thought what the PM and PMO had done was disgusting.
I did this after listening to a CBC (Ottawa) interview with an Nova Scotia Liberal MP who claimed her constituents had voiced no concern over the SNC-Lav scandal. I’ve never tried to ask anything of an MP but thought this is important enough to say something about it and do my bit to ensure my member could not (honestly) say the same. We all should, I think.

It’s a good point actually. If you ever watched the TV show about what Scientologists do to people who leave the faith you’d be reminded of what just happened to Philpott and W-R.

Narcissist leaders can have that effect. His speech to caucus reminded me of a parent telling a story to a bunch of 5 year olds about the scary wolf.

Kicking them out is the best thing for Trudeau to be honest, it keeps people in line because they don’t want to be next. But this is a distraction from the true issue, the rule of law. We can’t let this slide. Even if you think carbon taxes will save the planet, or Scheer has a hidden agenda. Let this go unpunished and we will never be the same.

It’s not a “Cult” and not comparable to Scientology which is a “Destructive Cult”. The Liberals are an “Abusive Organization”. I suppose however, Warren is technically correct in labeling the Liberals as a “Cult” because it has its own “culture”, but I think he meant much more than that………………….

April 2013, Reader’s Digest cover: “Justin: The Second Coming of Trudeau”.

From the beginning, Liberal Party of Canada consciously and deliberately set out to establish a cult of personality. 6,930,136 voters were sufficiently brainwashed to propel the regime to power. And now you find Trudeau is not Christ but Satan. It all suggests Canada is a deeply backward, strange country.

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you’d seen
You said you didn’t care
Sound formed in a vacuum
May seem a waste of time
It’s always been just the same

The path we can not take
You’ve caught me at a bad time

I say to the PM: I, and many other Canadians, no longer have trust in him and his corrupt Liberal government.

I say to Philpott and Wilson-Reybould: Thank you for holding up a mirror to the PM and reflecting his & his corruption right back at him. Not surprising “the feminist” shattered when he saw his image was not what he glibly espouses.

When push comes to shove, and the chips are down, Trudeau wasted no time proving himself the colonial epitome of the patriarchal entitled white male of privilege.

Pretty difficult to un-ring that bell in pursuit of more electoral riches.

Justin is ‘Dead Man Walking’. And true to Cult form, the female zombies are drawn to the camera and microphone and, from behind dead eyes, robotically attack the best among THEIR ranks who happen to be W O M E N. Just like them. Ironic, eh? Justin never fails to find an opportunity to use women. Even turning to the weakest women in The Cult to attack the strongest women – Jody and Jane. The Liberal Female Zombies are trotted out while L’il Billy Morneau, Shameless O’ Reagan, Spaceman Garneau and Angry Wayne Easter peek from behind the curtain. To paraphrase Hockey guy Brian Burke, watching the Liberal Party under Justin is “like watching an 18-wheeler going over a cliff.”

Yep, definitely a cult…

How else to explain the willingness of Liberal insiders to leak various rumors as to why Wilson-Raybould was actually removed as AG (Difficult to work with, negligent concerning a wrongful conviction appeal, at odds with Trudeau over a Supreme Court nominee, in conflict with the government over aboriginal policy, etc…), when they KNOW that each leak paints Trudeau as a liar, because his explanation for her removal denies all of the above.

They KNOW he’s not telling the truth about why she was removed, because they BELIEVE she was removed to unblock a path for a DPA for Lavalin. They KNOW he’s in grave danger of being investigated for an attempt to obstruct justice if they can’t make her removal be out something other than Lavalin.

So they cover for him, by throwing out all these phony stories, even if it makes Trudeau appear to be lying. They do it because they KNOW he’s lying, and they’re rallying around him to protect him.

When you KNOW your leader is lying about something that poses a fundamental threat to the rule of law, and all you care about is finding a way to help him get away with it, you’re a charter member of the cult…

Question. If “Diversity” seems to be the Cult talking point, why is it that only Female Liberal MPs are paraded out?

And did Justin prove his “fake Feminist’ bonafides by firing Jane and Jody but not Wayne Long? Does Justin trust the man but not the women. I’m confused trying to follow Justin’s thought processes. And hey, whatever happened to Katie T?

These LPC pols who have closed ranks…

If it proves out the JT and Butts and the rest have been lying. That there was inappropriate favourable treatment of SNC-LAVALIN (and others)…

They will have a political stink on them that will never leave for the rest of their lives…

I doubt any of these venal creatures has thought about that.

I guess my thoughts are cynical at best. I see this as politics being politics. Neither player, Justin or Jodi is clean in this. I see this a clash of controlling personalities. With everyone polerized on one side or the side other.

My bet is this will fade as we get closer to the election. Drawing focus to the issue that actually effects the majority of voters, The fact their gas just went up. (Carbon tax)

I doubt Trudeau is done, nor have we heard the last of Jodi. I suspect after October, neither will have the power they had only a few weeks ago.

457,Warren Kinsella,Bill Carroll had me read every word of this on-air this morning,2019-04-05 06:34:00,Warren,,"He tells me he has never done that before. CFRA Ottawa.


Dear Liberals:
This is an open letter to all of you. I want to start it by telling you why I became a lawyer.

It was a movie, called The Oxbow Incident. It was a Western, released some 75 years ago, and it starred Henry Fonda. It was about how a mob hanged a man. The wrong man.

At the end, the lynch mob all gather in a bar, and Fonda reads a letter the dead man wrote to his wife. Here is some of it:
“Law is a lot more than words you put in a book, or judges or lawyers or sheriffs you hire to carry it out. It’s everything people ever have found out about justice and what’s right and wrong,” Fonda says, reading the dead man’s letter. “It’s the very conscience of humanity. There can’t be any such thing as civilization unless people have a conscience, because if people touch God anywhere, where is it except through their conscience? And what is anybody’s conscience, except a little piece of the conscience of all men that ever lived?”

That speech is why I became a lawyer. What Fonda said, in a long-ago Western. What he said about justice, and how it is the thing that makes us human.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who I have never met, and Jane Philpott, who I have, remind me a little bit of Fonda, reading that dead man’s letter. They seem to believe, as I do, that if we do not have justice, we have not much left. They proudly gave up everything for it, after all.

After what you Liberals did, I suppose you are expecting me to liken you to a lynch mob. And, it is true: You were a bit like that.

Hell, you expelled Wilson-Raybould on the pretext of her making a tape on which a powerful man threatens her. When, a few days later, the prime minister of Canada spoke to Wilson-Raybould about why she’d been demoted — and he didn’t bother to tell her his principal secretary was secretly listening in. Keeping a record of what was said.

To use against her.

But, still, I will not call you a lynch mob. What you are, more accurately, is a group of people who belong to a cult. It is not a political party anymore. It is a cult.

It’s kind of understandable, although not ever forgivable. Justin Trudeau, to most of you, is the Liberal Party. He lifted the party from third place to first, and he propelled most of you into power. He made three big promises.

He said he’d be a feminist. He said he’d reconcile with indigenous people. And he said he’d bring back ethical government.

Well, he lied. His willingness to brutalize Wilson-Raybould, Philpott and Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes — and to cut a sweetheart deal for a sleazy donor — showed him to be none of those things. It showed him to be what this newspaper memorably called him this week: The fake feminist.

But still you follow him. Still you belong to his cult. Even when you know he has done wrong.

And so, you will end like all cults do: You will go down with your leader. You will perish with him, and you all richly deserve it.

Because voters understand — as they did at the end of The Oxbow Incident — that justice is all that keeps us from devolving into a lynch mob.

Which, as I say, you all resemble quite a bit.

And for which you will all pay.

Sincerely,

Warren","<div class=""articlecontent"">

As a lifelong Conservative activist, I appreciate your candor. The ‘cult’ designation is not confined to the Liberal Party. It is true that power corrupts and no one is immune. In my opinion, political parties have undermined our confidence and trust in our governance institutions. Their focus on acquiring and holding power has left the corpse of representative government rotting in a ditch. This and other commentary you have made is well worth pondering. Thank you for your contributions to reason and sanity.

JWR says imprecisely by “you speak truth”. It’s actually as Freeland said “your truth”. JWR’s “truth” isn’t everyone’s “truth”. And that’s the issue. Your “truth” can’t be a bludgeon nor an axiom to push upon anyone. And when others disagree you become an outlier and in potentially messy situation.
JWR realizes that now when she says she doesn’t understand the Liberal Party. But she does. It isn’t the party of principle, justice, or equality as she thought. She’s in the wrong party.

Counterpoint: I think the whole bad stuff was happening but the people who were doing it are not bad guys is kind of hurting her credibility.

This has to be the worst own goal in federal politics since the repeal of prohibition.

I hope Trudeau makes that other guy give them a DPA. And then watch as the prosecutors resign. And then when they find one willing to negotiate, let SNC know that a $2 billion file is the starting point for discussions.

It’s a rhetorical query. Are the Conservatives that much worse?

Given the same circumstances, there isn’t much reason to belief the Conservatives would do any better, plus, unlike the Liberals, they don’t hesitate to punish the disadvantaged and reward the wealthy.

So, whose left Darwin? Support the Liberals and hold your nose to vote for these idiots?
Not, the NDP. They have destroyed Alberta and BC by punishing investment and rewarding their unions!
The Greens? Go and read May’s platform; it’s full of blame Harper ad nauseaum. She won’t blame Trudeau, no. Doesn’t want to irritate Liberal voters who might move to the Greens.
Me, I’m waiting for the party to guarantee a reasonable prop. rep. and it won’t be the Liberals, no.

Having growing unionize middle class means there a lots of customers, which is what investors in the real economy actually need.

That’s how the economy grew so well in the 1940s to the 1960s. A(Plus the very high taxes on the rich.)

Maybe none of the above. You can bring someone down without choosing a side in who rises up in their place.

For those who have not done so already, I highly recommend reading JWR’s interview hand-in-hand with Dr Philpott’s interview. I can see why these two ladies are attracted to each other as women of principle.

Some of the more thought-provoking quotes from Dr Philpott:
“Politics has a profound effect on real people’s lives and it makes a difference as to whether people live or die, in many cases. So, this is not a game.”

“I would also say that there are lots of people out there that are saying I don’t understand the way things are done. Well, if this is the way things are done, then that’s why people want politics to change.”

My one disappointment from her Maclean’s interview is that Dr Philpott is giving serious consideration to moving on from politics. While I would not blame her for doing so, this would be an unfortunate loss for our country.

The interview is here:https://www.macleans.ca/politics/jane-philpott-we-cannot-ever-be-afraid-of-the-truth/

453,Warren Kinsella,"Your #LavScam weekly roundup (and this is just a sample of a few papers, folks",2019-04-06 08:51:00,Warren,,"Rosie DiManno, Toronto Star: “THE LIBERALS HAVE ABANDONED THEIR MORAL PRINCIPLES…and it’s Justin Trudeau’s fault…It is dismaying to me, a political agnostic, that thuggery is now attached to the federal Liberal party. It is appalling to me, a feminist, that so many who claim to respect women, who call themselves feminists — most especially the piously feminist prime minister but all his acolytes in the partisan media — have turned themselves inside-out to rationalize the bullying of female Liberal ministers. Because, readily admitted even, the existential threat of Andrew Scheer at 24 Sussex Drive looms as such a calamity, come the October election, that anything, anything, would be preferable, up to and including the abandonment of all moral principles.”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “It’s hard to see what is accomplished by this latest bout of thuggery — not only expelling Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, but revoking their nominations. It seems to be motivated by little more than sheer delight in retribution: vindictiveness for vindictiveness’s sake. And yet they are not one whit diminished by it; only the prime minister is. “
Christie Blatchford, National Post: “They’re thugs — the senior people in the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the clerk of the privy council and the nation’s top bureaucrat, the people in the office of Finance Minister Bill Morneau — or so close as to be indistinguishable from them. I refer to their collective behaviour around the SNC-Lavalin imbroglio, in particular their relentless effort to strong-arm the deposed attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould…The day after Justin Trudeau pointed to her ongoing presence in cabinet as evidence that should allay any concerns about the propriety of government conduct in relation to SNC and said her presence “spoke for itself,” she quit. “I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” she said. What a pistol she is.”
Andrew Coyne, National Post: “[Liberal MPs] knew what kind of party they wanted to be a part of from the moment they accepted their nominations; indeed, were they not the type of person that party attracts they would not have been recruited for it. It is the kind of party, and person, that unquestioningly puts loyalty to party before principle — and mercilessly punishes those who do not…What has agitated Liberal MPs is not the former attorney general’s recording of a conversation she correctly anticipated would be improper and could have guessed would be denied, or her failure to alert the prime minister at whose behest it had taken place (and who could not fail to have been informed of its contents), but rather that she has contradicted and embarrassed the leader. Or rather no: I suspect what truly outrages them is the sight of a person of conscience, unwilling to sacrifice her principles so readily on the altar of partisanship. For those who can still remember what that was like, it must be deeply shaming. For the rest, there is only one principle — blind loyalty to the leader — in which cause they are prepared to sacrifice any number of colleagues.”
Konrad Yakabuski, Globe and Mail: “Mr. Trudeau, owing to his own inattention to details and sheer arrogance, has created a royal mess. By ousting Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, he looks more interested in preserving power than upholding the principles he was elected on. It’s not “because it’s 2015” any more: Instead, it’s because it’s 2019, and there’s an election, the Liberals were born to win. Trying, however, to paint Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott as the villains of this story just doesn’t wash. Canadians are smarter, and more principled, than that.”
Rosie DiManno, Toronto Star: “It is grotesque, to me, how small and vindictive Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had become — lifted on the shoulders of his party disciples — trying to make a virtue out of the jettisoning of two women who dared to vouchsafe integrity, falling afoul of the caucus cabal…There was nothing remotely illegal about Wilson-Raybould “covertly” recording her telephone conversation with Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick — what Trudeau classified as “unconscionable.” It’s perfectly licit to record an exchange as long as one person knows it’s happening. Journalists do it all the time, to back up their notes, particularly when the other person on the line might later challenge the veracity of the content.”
Campbell Clark, Globe and Mail: “It’s not hard to see why most Liberal MPs felt Jody Wilson-Raybould should be booted out of the caucus. There’s no “I” in “team,” but in the Liberal team, there’s a capital “T” for Justin Trudeau. There really wasn’t much more of an explanation than that from Mr. Trudeau, when you get right down to it, for why Ms. Wilson-Raybould and another former minister, Jane Philpott, were kicked out.”
Tanya Talaga, Toronto Star: “It seems to me that if someone you work with is pressuring you into doing something you don’t want to do —if you think it is potentially illegal or wildly unethical — secretly taping them isn’t “unconscionable.”Especially if you’ve repeatedly said, to a variety of different people, that you did not feel comfortable with what was being asked of you. And when you tried to tell people, nobody seemed to be listening. No, instead they were telling you, explicitly and implicitly, that you were the one with the problem, that you just don’t seem to “get” how the whole system works. That this is how it’s always been done and you are an outsider if you don’t play by our rules.”
Andrew MacDougall, Globe and Mail: “For a prime minister positioned as the leader that the West’s liberal world order needs, doesn’t it feel just a little bit Trump-like? If you find that comparison a little tart, think again. Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal caucus have been channelling Donald Trump and the Republican Party, with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott jointly playing the role of former FBI director James Comey, ejected from the President’s orbit for refusing to play ball on the Russia investigation.”
Rosie DiManno, Toronto Star: “How very patronizing the prime minister was — has been throughout, actually, from his diminishment of Wilson-Raybould as “Jody” to his pained forbearance of this wilful woman — in the House on Tuesday, asserting he’d tried to show “patience and understanding,” as one would with an incorrigible child, but heavens, his sufferance had been wasted on so recalcitrant and defiant a Liberal liege, to the point that banishment was the only option to avoid a “civil war.”
Tanya Talaga, Toronto Star: “Given what was at stake and what Wilson-Raybould has experienced, none of what she asked for was unreasonable. As she has said from day one, she stood up for the truth. So did Philpott, a medical doctor who held the top portfolios in Trudeau’s government. She told CBC Radio’s The Current she had to resign from cabinet because if a member of the media asked her what she thought, she could not lie, she could not forsake the truth and toe the party line. If she did, how could she face her children, her family? “I chose the truth,” Philpott said. “I chose to act on principles that are so important to the future of our country. That is more important than my political career.”
Konrad Yakabuski, Globe and Mail: “When the Prime Minister is nonchalant about intervening in the judicial process because, you know, he’s used to getting what he wants, then someone needs to take him aside and explain the facts of life, not to mention constitutional democracy. He may very well have good reasons to think the DPP made the wrong call on SNC-Lavalin. But tough: There is a greater principle at play – the independence of prosecutors to act free of political interference – that cannot be sacrificed simply because, as PMO aide Mathieu Bouchard reportedly told Ms. Wilson-Raybould, “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to get re-elected.”
Rosie DiManno, Toronto Star: “Politics is a dirty rough-and-tumbled business not intended for the faint of heart. Or, apparently, those in possession of a moral compass. There is no redeeming dimension to Trudeau’s brutality. He has dissembled and shammed his way through nearly two months of tortuous squabble. If the Liberal party is in crisis, the seeds were sown in the PMO and a PM of towering hauteur. A phoney feminist to boot.”
Anthony Furey, Sun: “In recent weeks there have been several stories floated to attempt to smear Wilson-Raybould’s character and suggest she’d made previous errors in judgments. Anyone who has been peddling these smears should now feel deeply ashamed of themselves after this tape has come out.”
Tanya Talaga, Toronto Star: “On Wednesday, the Daughters of the Vote filled each seat in the House of Commons as part of the Equal Voice program that was created to attract more women into politics. Trudeau dumped Philpott and Wilson-Raybould the night before the Daughters’ arrival. But as Trudeau stood to address the Daughters, about 40 women stood up and turned their backs on the prime minister. The silent demonstration spoke volumes. If Trudeau was going to exclude Philpott and Wilson-Raybould, they would not listen to his words. They understood exactly what Trudeau’s actions against Philpott and Wilson-Raybould meant. He shut them out. I’m willing to bet a majority of Canadians understood as well.”
Thomas Walkom, Toronto Star: “For the opposition parties, all of this is a gift. The New Democrats can cite Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as proof that Trudeau is not as progressive as he claims. This should help them in the fall election. By splitting the left-liberal vote, it may in some ridings also inadvertently help Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives. The Conservatives have long made Trudeau himself, as opposed to his often popular policies, the focus of their attack. They must be grabbing themselves with glee. This story will not easily die. It is in the interest of too many to keep it going.”
Mitch Potter, Toronto Star: “Hold it up to the light at a certain angle and the mess our prime minister finds himself in today seems like the most Canadian of scandals — a terrible, perhaps even politically lethal outcome borne of ridiculously benign intentions all around. Justin Trudeau, his handlers will assure you, was thinking only to protect Canadian jobs. And his now ostracized former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was thinking only of prosecutorial independence…And if trust broke down in the admittedly grey area between jobs and justice, well, that’s really just a formatting error, many would argue. Once the dust settles on the slow-motion SNC-Lavalin affair, the lesson here involves fixing the format — break apart the two-hatted position of AG and JM into separate jobs and voila, no more grey area. But that rose-coloured version of the Liberal government’s slow-motion winter of discontent is finding few buyers. Instead, a bigger problem now is taking hold — the weakening of the prime minister’s personal political brand, a fact sealed this week.”
Alicia Elliott, Globe and Mail: “Not long after the SNC-Lavalin scandal broke in February, Mr. Trudeau and much of the Liberal Party, which once held Ms. Wilson-Raybould up as a star MP, turned on her. On Tuesday, she was turfed from the Liberal caucus, along with another former cabinet minister, her friend Jane Philpott, one of the few Liberals willing to back Ms. Wilson-Raybould. If a woman who was considered by many to be a “Good Indian” can be used and disregarded this way, what does it mean for those of us who are considered “Bad Indians”? Those of us who have suffered tremendous trauma and loss, such as Tina Fontaine?”
Amos Barshad, Globe and Mail: “Rasputins [like Gerald Butts] don’t act – they make a powerful few others act. The actions of those powerful few then reverberate. Why don’t they act? Because they lack the abilities to do so. The manipulative pop producer can’t sing or dance. Those grandiose fiction editors can’t write a line of decent stuff themselves. That’s the heartbreak: The dark control always stems from a place of deep and profound longing…The definitive trait of a Rasputin is control over one, or a few, prominent others. And that control must be controversial. Rasputins must have enemies. If their manipulations haven’t won them enemies, well, then their control is not quite untoward enough for the status of true Rasputin.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

We all know Justin Trudeau has lied about this affair. I’d love to see a newspaper list all his lies in on article. With additional paragraphs for lies and falsehoods told by his officials.

On second thought we may need pages not paragraphs.

Excellent suggestion Joe. They do that south of the border with Trump. It would be the worst of the worst if someone compiled that and put it on a public platform. It could be the thing to keep the heat on the Big Phony.

Justin is a “gaffe machine”. The spineless Liberal MPs, especially the women, got elected on the Trudeau brand. And they will be defeated on the now exposed Trudeau Brand. Dead Man Walking. Dead Party Talking.

You have to wonder how long the so-called unbiased media types will tolerate their colleagues, using the euphemism, ‘anonymous sources’, to help Trudeau’s PMO smear JWR & Dr. Philpott. They don’t seem to realize that the likes of most CBC hacks, Canadian Press, Mia Rabson, Joan Bryden, Glen McGregor Chantal Hebert, Susan Delacourt, Althia Raj, CTV News chief Joyce Napier. her hubby Neil MacDonald and a host of others acting as Katie Telford’s gofers have brought them all into disrepute. I find it hard to believe that legit journos/pundits, can stomach this and have failed to call out their colleagues. Anonymous sources indeed!

Why is CBC carrying the water so hard for their anonymous “PMO-approved” smearer, and the ridiculous claim that Wilson-Raybould wanted to interfere with the new AG? Is it to protect their preferential access to the PMO (and PMO leaks)?

The anonymous smearer has contorted the JWR’s statement that she would have to resign on principle if a directive to the DPP was issued by the new AG, to a faux claim that that amounts to a condition and attempted political interference.

The CBC itself reports that once JWR resigned, the “condition” disappeared. It was NOT a condition.

Both CBC and the leaker know that because Trudeau has not waived cabinet confidentiality over the period, that JWR is extremely limited in how she can respond to the absurd accusation.

But there is the CBC, aiding and abetting an anonymous smearer, in another attempted character assassination.

Prominent news organizations in Canada throughout this scandal have granted individuals anonymity for the purpose of character assassination.

Andrew Coyne’s latest column: 

https://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-the-real-scandal-in-the-lavalin-affair-is-trudeaus-attempts-to-pretend-its-not-a-scandal

Its ending is unfortunately weak – I think he would have done better to have put his discussion of the prosecutor’s right to decide on DPAs earlier, perhaps at the same place he says “Prosecutions are not policy choices”, because I find that putting it at the end dilutes his main arguments.

Aside from that, however, I find he summarizes everything perfectly.

Many of us go through this experience where we join a political party because we’re interested in public policy and want to make a positive difference. Then you join and at some point realize just how insular these parties are, more concerned with the inner politics of the party itself than with the party’s presumed raison d’etre (ie the betterment of the country). I had that realization many years ago and I know many others have. It’s just depressing, I don’t know what else to say. It’s no wonder that so many talented, amazing people in the world of business refuse to get involved in party politics.

First of all, Chretien would never have let this happen.

He would have pragmatically kept JWR in Justice. This was always about JWR losing her dream job. Period. SNC never had the LPC over a barrel.

But if he had shuffled her, he would have said, “I ‘ad to move ‘er to veterans to strengthen ‘er weaknesses on military. Because [a] good future priiiiime minisster must take dat less glam’ours files. Like I did with Indian affairs.” (a perfect deflective gaffe, that stokes JWR’s considerable ego).

And then if she still resigned after the Feb article, he would have said “I talk’ to my people, there is always pressure and I t’ink we need to change the Attorney General role. For dis mistake I am sorry. I didn’t know that Mrs Wilson Raybould could not take dat pressure. And dis was my mistake to put ‘er in a role she could not take. Won’t ‘appen again.”

Then when JWR released the Wernick tape, Chretien would have said: “Well you know, no one will ever be frank wit’ Mrs Wilson Rayboald ever again. So she has to leave the party or not have ‘er phone on.”

Lawyer Julian Porter, who sent the libel letter to Andrew Scheer, donated $1,000 to the Conservative Party, on December 28, 2017, according to Election Canada records, with Andrew Scheer as leader. Before Andrew Scheer was leader, Mr. Porter donated large sums to the Conservatives, and before 2010 he gave large sums to the federal Liberals.

Julian Porter has a noted expertise in libel law, granted. But why would Trudeau choose a lawyer who donates to the Conservatives? A puzzle that. — David Murrell in Fredericton.

Brutalized
verb
attack (someone) in a savage and violent way.
“they brutalize and torture persons in their custody”
synonyms: attack, abuse, assault, beat, thrash, thump, pummel, pound, batter
“they were brutalized by their captors

I’m a gay guy. And I have a job. The two are unrelated.
If I was treated inappropriately and fired for shady reasons – yes – that’s a serious issue. And I’ll fight it.
But if I chose to word it as: “As a gay man – I was brutalized by my employer”?
No – that would be my drama queen card. That would be “playing the gay card”. That would be blowing something out of proportion through use of a fucking thesaurus. That would be unfair to people who are fired for being gay.

He couldn’t possibly dream of a more hopeless opponent than PM Zoolander, who insists on overstaying his welcome and overplays a bad hand at every turn.

Doesn’t sound very astounding to me. One opinion would be that if nothing illegal happened, it was because JWR didn’t allow it to happen; another would be that the continued pressure to change her mind was itself illegal, even if she didn’t cave to it. That’s for lawyers to decide, right?

If Trudeau withdraws his letter it does look like an admission, but it seems to me that in legal terms that would end it. I doubt that Scheer can use that to sue for defamation himself, and HE would look bad if he tried. He’d be effectively reversing the optics -why should he do that, when they’re so favourable to him?

I think he’d just use it as a talking point in the upcoming election: see, Trudeau is a corrupt bully who’s afraid to follow through on his threat, because he knows what I said about him being a corrupt tool of this large corporation is absolutely true.

If JT “had engaged in dishonest and corrupt conduct that would contravene the Criminal Code,” then would not this be a criminal case? There would have to be evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict Mr. Trudeau. Is there such hard evidence? JWR doesn’t think so. Why not??

Scheer looks even less prime ministerial than Harper did in 2004 — and that’s saying something. But it won’t stop the CPC from getting in.

Trudeau already knows that. This libel threat is but another symptom of panic and desperation finally dawning on them in this PMO. The only good thing: THOSE people will never, ever, work again for a party leader going forward.

Couldn’t agree more. If Scheer is looking Prime Ministerial to you, it’s time for an eye exam! IMHO Scheer reminds me of an addled middle aged Opie, from a biblical Mayberry, shellacked to a Christian sheen, impervious to the realities of 2019, and earnestly presenting himself as the fundamentalist solution to all that he has determined ails us. 1959 is calling Mr. Scheer! It’s almost 2020, Father decidedly Does Not Know Best.

Trudeau and the LPC have demonstrated themselves corrupt to the core, and I cannot vote for them any more, but the Greens and the NDP present attractive alternatives to Mr. Scheer. I believe their time has arrived, albeit with a lot of help from the corrupt federal Liberals.

Canada’s main political leaders refuse to reform a political donations system that disenfranchises lower-income Canadians from making political donations to the party of their choice.

What’s worse, almost half of the existing, non-refundable federal political tax credits go unclaimed, the majority by groups that traditionally earn less, on average, than adult, white males, including many women, minorities, young people and seniors.

The major federal parties tout the generous political tax credits on their main contribution web pages or fundraising materials, but they don’t clearly explain they are non-refundable.

The problem is that, according to federal spending estimates, 47% of people who receive tax receipts for their political donations, either do not claim them or will not qualify for the tax credit.

In a Mar. 15, 2016 letter, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau refused a Nov. 22, 2015, request to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to make political tax credits refundable, stating: “Refundable credits are used in only a limited number of cases in the personal income tax system…where there is a clear policy rationale for doing so.”

Meanwhile, the government is delaying budget implementation of a review aimed at eliminating some tax credits that benefit higher-income Canadians to a much greater degree than others.

That has prompted concerns from the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, who have urged the government to make the details public.

While Trudeau trumpeted his feminism on International Women’s Day, defending his quota-based politics, he refuses to change this fundamentally unfair discretionary program that clearly and ethically should be applied universally, as it is today only in Ontario.

Former Ontario Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris made provincial political tax credits refundable 17 years ago, effective for the 2000 tax year, acknowledging at the time, “the unfair treatment the current system affords lower-income Ontarians — many of whom are women, seniors, disabled, ethnic minorities, farmers and Native Canadians.”

Might have even been on your Twitter feed WK, but I recall reading last week that expulsion from caucus required a majority vote from all members, according to Parliament of Canada Act. Also recall conventional wisdom dictating that CAUCUS should vote to expel JP and JWR to give Junior some breathing room on the issue (“… it was THEIR decision, not mine”). But no, his ego wouldn’t allow it, it had to be HIS decision.

I’m running out of popcorn watching this on-going drama… but I’m sure not complaining!

As I understand it, the parties have the choice of opting out. But they *do* have to go on record about that. So if they want to leave the power to eject caucus members to the leader, they should have held a vote on the first day of Parliament to say so. The point being that in doing so openly, they would be letting the voting public know where the caucus stands on these issues.

In any case, it is the law. If Trudeau wanted to repeal it, he’s had ample time to do so; but he can’t just *ignore* it.

Many people seem to question whether bribing foreign governments is wrong. It is wrong because those countries will never break free of corruption if multinationals keep dangling millions in front of officials who are one step from a mud hut. It is also wrong because regardless of local customs in poor countries, CANADA HAS LAWS THAT PROHIBIT SUCH BRIBES.
Many people seem to question whether it is wrong for the PM and his team to pressure the Justice Minister. It is wrong because everyone is supposed to be equal under the law. It is also wrong because the DP law SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTERESTS.
Many people seem to question whether it is wrong for the PM to unilaterally eject JWR and JP from caucus. It is wrong because he preached respect for the independance of MPs and a move away from PMO dominance. It is also wrong BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS HE CAN’T DO IT.

Furthermore, and related to that, if we ever want certain third-world countries to rise out of poverty, combatting corruption is a necessary part of that process. Look at countries like Nigeria and DRC — ridiculously endowed with natural resources and riches, yet most people are dirt poor. Total kleptocracies. There’s no question that seriously cracking down on corruption and bringing in more transparency and accountability would benefit the people of those countries who don’t happen to be the kleptocrats and their entourages.

Trudeau has the power as PM to direct the affairs of caucus and can also act unilaterally to boot caucus members at his own discretion. No law in the land can stop the Liberal Party caucus from acting on internal party issues as they have autonomy outside of the law as it is applied by the legislature.
RCMP will never look at internal party matters of caucus and hold the PM to account. Most assuredly the PMO made the decision for the PM. Dissension within the ranks of caucus is understandably an issue that the PM had to deal with in a measured response of expulsion due to a lack of allegiance to government over rule of law minutia.

The thing is, political parties receive federal money – maybe most notably in tax credits for donations. Of course if an organization receives money from the government, it is reasonable for the government to have rule that they must follow.
In this case, the rule is to acknowledge the fact that an MP is elected partly as an individual, and partly as a member of the party. In order to prevent authoritarian rule of the party leader, the law requires that most party members agree to kick out an MP.

Trudeau definitely experiences justice differently than the rest of the country.

He came into office promising a new way to do politics. Well he finally kept a promise! It’s just that we didn’t think he meant Soviet style politics and justice.

Her boss, Mr. Mario Dion, was also hired under a cloud.
“The Trudeau Cabinet failed to consult with opposition party leaders, as required by law, before appointing the new Ethics Commissioner, and at the time the commissioner was investigating Trudeau and Finance Minister Morneau so the Cabinet was in a clear conflict of interest when making the appointment of this key democracy watchdog,”

Possible violation of Parliament Act of Canada – Section 81 and Conflict of Interest Act: Section 6.

Back then, media was still in love with Trudeau and ignored Democracy Watch’s warnings.

Its too late for the Liberals who are desperately trying to “change the channel”. The had their chances , yet managed to kill the cat 9 times. My mother used to say that if you always tell the truth, you never have to make anything up, nor try hard to remember your “story” and keep all the facts “straight”. And so when Liberal after Liberal comes before a camera and says “Canadians want to talk about – take your pick – climate change, jobs, the economy, opportunities for the middle class, blah, blah, blah – no, we Canadians DO NOT. Canadians remain very interested in LavSCAM, the Rule of Law, the independence of the prosecutorial system, corruption and political interference, and clandestine lobbying and sweet heart deals. This is what Canadians want to talk about. And Canadians will move on when Canadians want to move on. The arrogant mistake of the Liberal Party is to equate what’s best for the Liberal party with what’s best for Canadians. Canadians now know the last election was a mistake where a phony brand and a fake leader with a thin resume was in the right place at the right time. Canadians won’t re-elect Justin. He’s just not ready. And he lies. And he’s smug. And he’s insincere. And he treats women badly. The only thing Justin has not done is call the news media “FAKE”. At least not yet.

440,Warren Kinsella,LavScam lesson,2019-04-11 06:43:00,Warren,,"I teach crisis communications to lawyers-to-be at the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Law, my alma mater.

My students, as always, are terrific. And, for the whole term, we’ve been focussing on just one topic: LavScam.

It makes sense. LavScam is the perfect fusion of a communications crisis and the law. It has all the requisite elements. Possible obstruction of justice, possible breach of trust – and, indisputably, a raging dumpster fire of a comms crisis.

In every class, we’ve analyzed the latest LavScam controversies. We’ve watched, and re-watched, Justin Trudeau’s now-infamous press conference. “Why didn’t he apologize?” asked several of my students, bewildered. (Good question.)

We analyzed Jody Wilson-Raybould’s evidence as she testified at the clown show that masquerades as a Justice Committee. “She should be Prime Minister,” several of my students said of her, with something approaching reverence. (Agreed.)

We developed communication strategies, early on, to extricate the Liberal Party from the ethical quagmire that – pollsters say – is rendering them a one-term government.

Those strategies, with minor variations, all involved sincere and public apologies to Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott; an admission that SNC-Lavalin is not, and never was, entitled to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA); a dismissal of every staff person who was attempting to pervert the course of justice; and – as Jean Chretien did in the sponsorship scandal – calling in the RCMP to investigate.

Like I say: I have smart students.

Now, Professor Kinsella is writing this before the final class of the term, which was on Friday. At that one, we will almost certainly discuss the big news of the week – which, as the civilized world knows, was Justin Trudeau’s corrupt, cowardly, craven decision to expel Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus. Because, you know, they objected when Trudeau and his senior staff tried to interfere in a criminal case to help out a donor.

Still in Trudeau’s caucus, however, is Kent Hehr – the Calgary Liberal MP who was found guilty of sexually harassing women. I don’t know if one of my students will raise that unequal application of justice, but I wouldn’t be surprised. It’s an interesting legal distinction, after all: two women who gave up everything to uphold the Rule of Law, and who were defamed, demeaned and destroyed for their efforts.

And, a man who sexually harassed two other women, kept in the family. Kept as a Liberal candidate.

“Not the actions of a feminist,” one of my students might say. And they’d be right, of course.

Also newsworthy, at that final class of Law 599: Gerald Butts’ saturnalian decision to submit text messages and emails and notes to the aforementioned clown show.

A January conversation between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, provided by Butts as a verbatim transcript, stood out.

Wilson-Raybould: “I love being Minister of Justice and Attorney General. I’m not going to lie. Indigenous Services is not my dream job. I’m not going to lie about that.”

Trudeau: “I know it is not your dream job, but it is core to this government, to maintain a legacy. And, to be crass about it, our political legacy.”

Wilson-Raybould: “I feel I’m being shifted out of Justice for other reasons.”

Trudeau: “We would not be doing this if it weren’t for Scott [Brison]’s decision.”

Wilson-Raybould: “I don’t agree. This is not how we change peoples lives.”

Trudeau: “After an election, everything is fresh again.”

Now, my students, who are exceptionally bright, will likely know that Gerald Butts and Justin Trudeau made three critical errors in submitting that transcript.

One, it’s a transcript. Unless Gerald Butts has enhanced shorthand skills no one knew about, it is highly likely that someone taped that conversation. Which, as any sharp-eyed law student will know, is the very pretext Trudeau used to expel Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus: a secret taping.

Two, Wilson-Raybould was not aware Butts was listening in. That’s not breaking a law, per se, but it’s certainly not ethical sunny ways, either.

Thirdly – and most ominously, because my students all know who Marie Heinen is – Gerald Butts submitted many notes. When, in the pre-trial manoeuvrings in the trial Heinen’s client, Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, PMO and PCO solemnly swore that those sorts of notes simply don’t exist. Uh-oh.

If Messrs. Trudeau and Butts don’t think Canada’s best criminal lawyer didn’t spot that error, they’re dumber than dirt found at an SNC-Lavalin job site. She did. And she will be cross-examining them about it starting in August, mere weeks before the election is scheduled to kick off.

There’s a lot more of that sort of thing, but you get the point. In the final minutes of my final lecture, I therefore intend to tell my amazing students this: “In your future legal practice, remember what Justin Trudeau’s party did in LavScam in the year 2019,” I’ll say. “And, if you want to win, always just do this:
“The opposite.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

You mean the biggest chunk of the West, a Kenney-sized Alberta. But it’s so nice to see AB with a new blood-enemy to replace the old convenient standby, namely Quebec. Now Albertans can fondly curse out their fellow westerners, British Columbians! So much for a united West wanting in on pipelines…

Elections are part of the rule of law and it wasn’t Martians who put Horgan in, was it? As such his is a legitimate government and they are both western and anti-pipeline. If Joe and Jane British Columbia don’t like what he’s doing, let ’em throw him out on his ass in the next election. But until then, BC remains anti-pipeline, period.

“Elections are part of the rule of law and it wasn’t Martians who put Horgan in, was it?”

No, it was a protest vote…same thing that handed Notley the reins in Alberta and the federal NDP Official Opposition status and many seats in Quebec when the Bloc and Liberal votes collapsed simultaneously. None were sustainable. None are an actual indication of popularity.

Even though I’ll be hurt by it, I would still *love* to see Alberta turn off the oil to BC (briefly), just to see the left-wingers squirm. You don’t want pipelines, you say? Okay, fine…we’ll use RAIL CARS instead…because hey, what could possibly go wrong?

Warren:Any chance they will manage to push that August court proceeding back to after the election?

Assuming it isn’t and assuming there will be even more damning stuff on Trudeau and others made public at those proceedings, by then it will be too late for the LPC to jettison JT and have a leadership contest. (And anyone in caucus will be severely damaged goods as well because they have remained in it) So it is imperative that the LOC rank and file (caucus certainly won’t act) rise up and demand JTs exit immediately or they will be annihilated in the fall.

Did our then membership do that with Harper after he lost big-time in 2004? To ask the question, is to answer it. This Liberal membership won’t be any different.

Based on the stats, gays don’t really believe in gay marriage either. But now that it’s here, can’t we just move on? Live and let live and worry about the economy and corruption. Doug Ford has it right, rules on behaviour like we have with alcohol and gaming need to be removed. Stop trying to regulate behaviour and spend your energy growing the economy.

I disagree:1) That article is from around 2005. Kenney’s statement would not have deviated as far from the views of his constituents as it would 14 years later. Kenney was also an Opposition MP. Part of his job was to oppose the government, although he could have done so in a more tasteful manner. Note: I was one of Kenny’s constituents until 2001. While I would not have agreed with his statement in 2001 or 2005, I would have still voted for him

2)An MP can keep personal views personal without tainting their actions as a legislator. Kenney’s legislative record has not been socially conservative. If an MP were to be up to their eyeballs in personal debt, should that preclude them from legislating economic issues?

3) Same sex marriage, and abortion and many other allegedly important social issues are under federal jurisdiction. In a provincial election, such topics are distractive

4) The debate over GSA’s is a red herring. Kenney says he wants to change parental notification rules back to how they were pre-NDP, which would align with other provinces. Was Kathleen Wynne anti-LBGQ in supporting the same policy as Kenney? Regardless, Kenney won’t act. This is nothing more than a get out the vote measure to SoCons. Notley is the one who politicized GSA’s in the first place

5) The NDP has been a resounding failure. It couldn’t even implement a hiring freeze to contain the deficit. Alberta is on its way to $100B in debt. Some very tough and unpopular decisions need to be made. Kenney may turn out to be a sheep in wolf’s clothing, but Notley absolutely does not have the capability to do what’s necessary

6) Why does Alberta need to fund public services at by far the highest levels in the country? All it need do is bring per capital spending down to near BC levels to avoid financial ruin. Kenney will be unencumbered by public sector union support in making the obvious choice to reduce spending

7)Why need a politician be likeable? No correlation exists between likability and effectiveness, except maybe for actors and strippers. Margaret Thatcher was a transformative leader that turned around the “sick man of Europe”. She was not likeable, although I am mesmerized by footage of her sparring with opponents. She could take on several at a time and leave them trembling in the corners

So if I were still electable to vote in Alberta, it would be for the UCP because economic issues are real while social issues are more symbolic. I don’t care about Kenney’s personality and actually hope he turns out to be as mean and hard nosed as the NDP portrayal as he must make some very unpopular decisions

As downtown a Torontonian now living in Alberta, a former chronic NDP volunteer in Toronto. But now right-of-centre convert after Singh abandoned working families with his anti-pipeline extremist rhetoric, and witnessing indigenous people pull themselves into the middle class because of the free market in Alberta.

I’m having a hard time. Many of us are having a hard choice.

I’ve despised Kenney for 17 years, when he came to speak at my campus on the eve of the Gulf War II.

I’ve despised his knee jerk policy decisions as immigration minister. Like making immigration decisions about “marriage fraud” because the Star printed a news story.

I could on and on.

The hope is, that after we strategically vote out the NDP, that the UCP caucus forces Premier Kenney to resign within one year.

It’s harder choice than you think it is. We are not better off than we were 4 years ago. The status quo is failing us in Alberta. And I now understand what Western Alienation feels like, and it sux.

My values are always about making sure everyone has a fair shake at life.

My Economic politics were shifting when i saw how the free market created opportunities, how a labour shortage with little regulation (besides strict environmental and safety of course) gave people the confidence to start their own business, knowing full well that if their business failed, there was a private sector job still waiting for them. (In my case, my awaiting job was working on a drilling rig.)

My politics began to evolve that free markets best achieves my ideals of getting people out of poverty, and social justice.

My loyalties were always NDP, so I was becoming a Blue NDP.

When Singh pulled a stunt like he did, and was against a pipeline that would provide work for working families… my politics completely flipped.

All I could think, how many families have to declare bankruptcy now because of pipelines delays, that Singh champions. How many children now have a broken home, because of the financial stresses that this anti pipeline movement algae brought onto others.

Hope that answers your question.

It wasn’t wrong at the time. It changed over the years.

If it had been wrong he would not have been elected. And had he professed publically the opinion he has on the issue now back then he would not have been elected PM (or MP) for that matter.

Similar things can be seen throughout history: At the Lincoln Douglas debates Lincoln could not have argued that blacks were equal or that all of the US should be proclaimed Slave-free. He would never have been nominated as the candidate for president nor won the presidency. He changed that position within five years.

And today you can’t argue that Kenney is not the right choice for premier based on a speech he made 15 years ago.

Back when Canada was only the second or third country in the world to recognize ‘gay marriage’ (one was Belarus, I forget the other) a bunch of European nations had already implemented ‘civil unions’. IOW, all the exact same rights and privileges of marriage but *with a different name*. Seemed like a fine idea to me…why antagonize the minority of religious people with strong objections to using the term “marriage” if you don’t have to (unless you’re spoiling for a fight)?

If I recall correctly, the CPC position and the NDP position had some logic. The Liberal one did not.

CPC: Create the term “Civil Union” and treat those as legally equal. The term “Marriage” was borrowed from Religion and couldn’t change.

NDP: Gay Marriage is a human right, and MP’s will be whipped.

Liberal: Gay Marriage is a human right, but we will allow MP’s to vote how they want.

I would expect that all parties would fully support human rights.

As a now unemployed gay man I’ll vote for Kenney.

I find Notley’s new found verbal “support” for the oil industry to be just that, verbal only. In my discussions with members of her party, they are all anti-oil and anti-natural gas, and want to shut it down sooner.

Notley says she will balance the budget by the end of her second term. This assumes royalty revenues of 12 billion a year. They are currently less than 6 billion a year. The budget balance won’t happen. Oh by the way, last campaign in 2015, Notley said she’d balance the budget by 2019. Oops she pulled a Trudeau.

I consider myself socially very liberal and fiscally responsible. At one point the Liberal party seemed to think that way. But now the Liberals, NDP, and Greens of this country all say they will control spending but none do. They all run, or propose, massive deficits which will eventually cause much hardship in terms of cuts to health care, education, public services, pensions, etc. when we have to make interest payments.

100 billion debt in Notley’s last budget forecast with lots of new spending announced by Notley during this campaign. No thanks.

Your clarity and perspective is refreshing Joe.
It’s always about the economy and this Trudeau/Notley alliance to impose a tax in the middle of an Alberta recession is plain dumb and will cost Trudeau the next election. Truly, many middle class folks are hurting and the message is they WILL be hurting if Trudeau is elected again because taxes must go up to pay for the increasing interest on Canada’s debt. Moreover, climate change targets are NOT being met with this intro. of a Carbon tax. No, that tax will have to climb to meet those targets. So Canada get ready!

I don’t where we’re really going but it’s definitely downhill from the Canada-US Acid-Rain Agreement or the spectacular success of the Montreal Protocol on ozone depletion.

Kyoto was mandatory, a mess and a complete failure. Neither the two biggest GHG emitters, US or China were covered. Copenhagen ended in failure while Paris, although voluntary, is uncertain at best.

The world has not met its GHG targets and prospects are dim, even with continuing, steady progress.

And if that wasn’t enough, our precious hydroelectric power here in Quebec leaves a greater carbon-emitter footprint than first thought.

I voted for Wildrose last time and I am voting NDP this time around. I became more progressive on many issues on my own these past few years.

It’s terrible that you have been out of work. I was unemployed and underemployed for many years during this downturn before getting my current job.

We live in oil country and Alberta’s fortunes will always rely on the price of oil. The current economic situation wouldn’t be all that different regardless of who was in power.

The NDP platform is not perfect (I agree with most of it, but I would like the carbon tax to go away—it’s a political loser in Alberta) but I don’t trust Kenney.

But it’s funny how all of the UCP campaign materials de-emphasize any mention of Kenney’s Name while NDP is putting Notley front and center. People who vote UCP are voting for the party in spite of it’s leader.

NDP has a long shot for certain. The polls put their ceiling at around 40%. But if we take the long of view of things, with changing demographics, I think that progressive parties will be able to win elections here once in a while.

Regardless of the result, Rachel Notley is a fantastic leader and she should remain at the helm of her party after the election.

.. the potential political ‘swing’ in Alberta’s upcoming election is fascinating.. but also disturbing. Its also a great impending lesson to the rest of Canada.

Is it possible that ‘politics’ ie elected Public Service is akin to the weather or climate change? Maybe our vaunted mainstream media can explain.. you know – ‘the mood of the people’. It was easy to see how Doug Ford and his party simply washed in to power on a huge wave of disgust – quite similar to how Justin Trudeau did actually.

But how to explain the seeming flip flop of ordinary Albertans ? First they tolerate CP for decades leading up to Alison Redford, then in a real shocker, elect the NDP, and now seemingly are charmed by Jason Kenney et al.. ??

Riddle me this Batman. Rural Albertans will now ‘lock out’ the NDP as will Edmonton and perhaps some part of Calgary will respect the NDP. But it will be a UCP sweep so they say.

Kenney with all his grubby vote gathering, personal chubby charm and glib dogmatic droning & promises of glory plus his equally dubious riding candidates will overwhelm Notely’s government. She and the NDP were granted four years.. presumably to restore ‘the Alberta advantage’ .. huh ??

Was Notely supposed to somehow convert Alberta’s tanking toxic petro ‘economy’ into one rivalling Norway’s ? ? With the bottom fallen out of the Harper/Novak hydrocarbon super power wet dream ? Was she supposed to command the weather and climate change ? Help convert those lawless LGTBQ folks foolishly hoping they too deserved to be treated with dignity?

Again, my question is what information.. from where, from whom.. somehow convinces adult Alberta voters to surrender common sense or cognitive capability.. and rush the voting stations in support of the newly merged new look UCP. Is there some sort of ‘For The People’ or ‘Get Great Again’ or new ‘Alberta Advantage’ Canadians should get stoked about ?

It makes me wonder if Canadians could so blithely forget about hockey & switch to badminton.. it makes about as much sense. Are Albertan’s that keen on a Saskatchewan loutling via Ottawa who wants into the bedrooms of the province? Wants to seperate from Canada.. does not accept climate change.. and truth be told only used Calgary as a fake ‘principal residence’ to collect 10,000 $ monthly while actually his ‘principal residence’ was an Ottawa, Ontario condo, walking distance from Parliament. All Canadians chipped in on his salary and his gold plated pension plan & his expenses. What was ‘great’ about that ? How did that impress rural Albertans ?? Or middle class hard working Edmontonians.. or drill rig roughnecks, or his ‘home’ riding.. riddle me that ?

Considering Alberta’s share of global emissions is .005% and Canada’s contribution is 1.6%, it does make perfect sense to sacrifice 4.5 million Albertans so Canada can reduce its percentage to 1.55%. Actually if you get rid of us, you may reach Harper’s 2030 objectives. It’s a win win and I’m surprised more Canadians are not supporting that initiative. We might find a jurisdiction nearby that is participating in economic development.

Gord,

And they all laughed at me when I suggested it was almost inevitable that Alberta would join the States. That’s the EASY way out — unless they actually have the balls to hold an independence referendum/election. Something tells me they don’t.

At least here in Quebec we had the balls to complain royally but then put it to the test twice. Let them do the same, if they’ve really got the guts. Here’s a hint: Kenney doesn’t.

Ronald
The first stage is to challenge C69, C48 insist that TMX is built promptly and propose revisions to equalization. Canada needs to determine whether it will accept Alberta as a fossil fuel producing province sitting on the worlds 3rd largest reserves which we will develop with or without Canada. It seems inconceivable that we would watch as the world pushes through consuming 100 million barrels per day and leave hundreds of billions in revenue untapped. Alberta will not capitulate this time around. Push back will prompt a referendum on equalization. Of course it won’t produce results. Canada’s negative response will strengthen Albertans resolve for another referendum. Kenny will play a part. Why do you think Harper met with Bolton? In any event, I don’t believe those outside of Alberta understand the level of angst.

Gord,

First off, I get pissed at meaningless separatist rhetoric. But I’m not an idiot. I don’t expect Alberta to freeze in the dark in budgetary terms. Their’s is an oil and gas resource based province. That’s reality. And those resources need to be fully developed and exported. But equally important is the Made-In-Alberta Transition Decision And Plan. That’s another striking reality. Transition to clean energy is inevitable, especially in fossil-fuel jurisdictions. Even Saudi Arabia is working on that. In the meanwhile, find a damned way through elections to get a pipeline solution that both Alberta and BC support, or at least can live with. Asian exports are crucial and must happen in the medium term.

You just hit the nail on the head. Canada’s current “plan” to reduce carbon emissions is to destroy Alberta’s economy and bankrupt its citizens, while the rest of Canada’s “sacrifice” is a 4-cent-per-litre gas tax.

I have a depressing sense that Jason Kenney, a real-life cartoon villain only the creators of South Park could love, will scrape through to slimy victory thanks to the Alberta Uber Alles strain that still courses through significant parts of the province’s bloodstream. However, if the polls are wrong, Mr. Kenney, if that is indeed his name, can always find work as a Commander Waterford understudy in a road company version of The Handmaids Tale – The Musical.

Thankfully you only have one vote and others like you are greatly outnumbered by practical and decent citizens throughout the entire province. Albertans emphatically want to get the province back to work and get the economy back to fiscal sanity.

The situation is so dire that Notley could not campaign on her dismal record, she had to “go low”. Apart from public sector heavy Edmonton, nobody’s buying that this time around.

Let me begin by stating that I have the outmost respect for JWR.

In this context, it’s easy to vilify JWR to central Canada and the Maritimes. I may not agree with her vilification, but politics is not always fair.

On the other hand, Dr Jane Philpott is much more difficult (I would say nearly impossible) to vilify in all this since. First, she is a medical doctor and the general population tends to trust medical doctors a lot more than it does lawyers, politicians, and drama teachers.

Second, she was not under fire when everything was going down to discredit JWR. Rather she stood by JWR out of principle, resigning when there was no external pressure on her to do so. So it’s much harder to ascribe ulterior motives.

Fred from BC says: 

April 15, 2019 at 1:28 am

I know how you feel. JWR is my MP, and I just can’t forgive the bad decisions and poor judgement she showed as AG/Justice Minister (there is a time to just *keep your mouth shut*… “no comment” is sometimes your best option). Much of the legal community agrees: she was out of her depth. I was thinking that it was because she wasn’t very bright, frankly, but then I read that last interview she did and realized that she is actually pretty intelligent (if those were in fact her own words, and I have no reason to suppose otherwise)…which means that she is most likely either a) arrogant or b) immature (or possibly both) rather than unintelligent. Jane Philpott, though, I can’t think of a single bad thing to say about, and for the same reason you mentioned: she has no axe to grind here and no inherent conflict of interest to be influenced by. She’s got my support, for sure…

For Conservatives’ sake, I hope the Liberals are considering such a move. Mark Carney as leader would guarantee a decade of Conservative rule.

They need someone like Warren’s MP, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. I don’t agree with everything he says, but he’s at least genuine, humble, not smarmy (a rarity in Liberal circles), and has ideas that will resonate. Whether he’s a good campaigner though, I wouldn’t know.

It’s not about jobs, for the reasons already discussed in the media, plus I believe the feds have regulatory ways of circumventing a ten year ban on SNC getting federal contracts.

It’s not about SNC moving from Montreal for reasons already discussed.

It seems like some one or some group, wants a trial, or its lead up investigatory work, to cease.

434,Warren Kinsella,LavScam latest: Trudeau wants to give these creeps a sweetheart deal,2019-04-15 09:34:00,Warren,,"An excellent Lavscam investigative report by CBC, no less. And it’s a doozy.

Millions of dollars in a safe to facilitate bribes. Massive fraud. And Justin Trudeau’s favourite engineering firm still up to its ears in slime. The same firm which, also this morning, we are hearing in the indispensable Hill Times that what I reported weeks ago is true: they are going to get the deferred prosecution sweetheart deal that Jody Wilson-Raybould fought, and was martyred over.

Some of the CBC yarn below. Full story here.


If called to testify at an SNC-Lavalin trial, he could expose who else in the senior ranks may have known about $47.7 million in bribes and $130 million in fraud tied to projects in Libya — crimes the RCMP alleges were committed by the company between 2001 and 2011.

SNC-Lavalin has been lobbying hard behind the scenes to secure what’s called a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to avoid going to trial. The company, as well as its supporters in government, argue thousands of jobs are at risk if it is convicted and barred from bidding on federal contracts.

But a CBC News investigation reveals why 12 top directors who left the company years ago also have plenty at stake if the case goes to trial. SNC-Lavalin’s former board is an influential who’s who of the corporate elite that includes former senators, banking executives and members of the Order of Canada. They will all likely face close — and very public — scrutiny if called to testify about whether they knew of any corruption happening on their watch.

By piecing together public records, including past testimony, exhibits, depositions and separate civil suits involving the company, CBC News has uncovered a string of instances where those board members were allegedly told of financial irregularities — including a $10-million stash of cash kept in an office safe in Libya.

…if the claims and allegations are true, it means the company, despite red flags, continued its lavish spending to win contracts from Libya’s Gadhafi regime.

In 2008, SNC-Lavalin played host to Saadi Gadhafi. The playboy son of the Libyan dictator spent three months in Canada, visiting Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in a trip arranged by Ben Aïssa.

Outside auditors raised concerns about the bills totalling $1.9 million.

RCMP forensic accountants have since scoured 44,000 pages of company records. At the 2017 preliminary hearing for bribery charges against an SNC-Lavalin financial controller, Stéphane Roy, investigators testified that they uncovered bills for private security and hospitality that included:

$30,000 for escorts.



$180,000 for a stay at the Hyatt Regency in Toronto.



$193,501.81 for limousine rides.

<p><strong><em>But a CBC News investigation reveals why 12 top directors who left the company years ago also have plenty at stake if the case goes to trial. SNC-Lavalin’s former board is an influential who’s who of the corporate elite&nbsp;that includes former senators, banking executives and members of the Order of Canada. They will all likely face close — and very public — scrutiny if called to testify about whether they knew of any corruption happening on their watch.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>By piecing together public records, including past testimony, exhibits, depositions and separate civil suits involving the company, CBC News has uncovered a string of instances where those board members were allegedly told of financial irregularities — including a $10-million stash of cash kept in an office safe in Libya.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>…if the claims and allegations are true, it means the company, despite red flags, continued its lavish spending to win contracts from Libya’s Gadhafi regime.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In 2008, SNC-Lavalin played host to Saadi Gadhafi. The playboy son of the Libyan dictator spent three months in Canada, visiting Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in a trip arranged by Ben Aïssa.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Outside auditors raised concerns about the bills totalling $1.9 million.</em></strong></p>

The sleaze drips from everyone and everything involved with this whole sordid SNC Lavalin affair. That there can be ANY possibility that a DPA is still in play for these creeps shows that “Sunny Ways”, “Rule of Law” and “Doing Politics Differently” are, to Trudeau and his staff, just random words pulled from a dictionary and strung together because they sounded good. Vile, unprincipled hypocrites, the whole lot of them.

Trudeau MUST win Quebec. And he has a chance at governing again even if he wins fewer seats than the Conservatives. He knows that. He and Horgan are good friends and Trudeau has learned how well that has worked for Mr. Horgan!
Those of you who will vote for the Greens realize that if the Greens pick up a number of seats and they can because Ms. May is becoming popular, then a Trudeau/Green coalition will put Trudeau in power again.
Will that be better than a Conservative win?

How bad is what we don’t know compared to what we do know? The thought process has to be that its better to lose an election and disappear rather then fess up to the entire truth and face the consequences now. So, how bad is it, and, do they really think the media wont follow this scent? The conspiracy theorist in me is thinking that a few insiders know the truth, but, even leaking rumors right now is dangerous.

Hi Warren,

Thanks for keeping this story in the news cycle during the last few weeks, as JT and his gang tried to wait it out…. This whole thing stinks so much even the CBC has finally taken notice… Some of my “progressive” friends still refuse to admit this is more then a minor scandal, and always point to the possible election of Scheer as a reason to hold your nose and re-elect Justin…. It seems to me that at this point, it’s not a matter of left or right anymore, and a government that is ready to overlook or condone this kind of corruption needs to be removed from office….

Quebec Inc. strikes again.

As an Albertan, I vacillate between amusement and anger at Trudeau’s apparently malleable concept of the rule of law: activist judges on the Federal Court scupper the TransMountain expansion = “We must respect the courts, what else can we do?”; independent prosecutors refuse to cut a deal with a Quebec company and major Liberal donor = “Oh no, 9000 jobs are at stake! The national interest demands we override the DPP and ignore the express wording of the statute!”

Check out this CBC story: Justin Trudeau’s annus horribilis continues. I’m almost starting to feel sorry for the guy.

Almost.


Justice Patrick Gleeson ordered Commissioner of Lobbying Nancy Bélanger to reconsider her predecessor Karen Shepherd’s decision not to investigate a complaint about the trip. Trudeau’s January 2017 trip to the island came at a time when the Aga Khan was discussing funding for projects with Trudeau’s government.

Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson found in December 2017 that Trudeau violated ethics rules by accepting the trip to the Aga Khan’s island.

However, Shepherd declined to investigate, saying the Aga Khan was not paid to lobby the government and, as a result, did not fall under the Lobbying Act.

Gleeson ruled that Shepherd’s definition of ‘payment’ was too narrow.

“The Act’s definition of ‘payment’ might reasonably encompass things of value that fall outside the scope of ‘remuneration,'” Gleeson wrote. “For example, and without expressing any view on the question, ‘anything of value’ might reasonably include a directorship within a corporation or organization, even in circumstances where the position is voluntary.”

While the Aga Khan was not paid, he was a member of the Aga Khan Foundation’s board. A foundation employee was registered to lobby on behalf of the organization.

Gleeson said that should have flagged the incident for review.

“I am of the view, in light of the purposes and objectives of the Lobbying Act and the Code and the investigative obligation imposed by section 10.4 of the Act, that the Commissioner was required to take a broad view of the circumstances in addressing the complaint,” Gleeson wrote.

“Instead, the record before the Court reflects a narrow, technical and targeted analysis that is lacking in transparency, justification and intelligibility when considered in the context of the Commissioner’s duties and functions. The decision is unreasonable.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Trudeau kneecapped another female leader. He has the Transmountain approval sitting on his desk for 54 day. He could have issued it and saved Notley and carved out some Liberal seats for the upcoming election. And he didn’t. Her alliance with Trudeau is what cost her because Trudeau is no friend to the west. That much is clear.

Secretly he wants Kenny in there so he can extend his white nationalist Nazi rhetoric to another leader. Most divisive PM in Canadian history.

I suspect Kenney’s first six months will be lower key than expected. He will repeal the provincial carbon tax, which at $30 currently exceeds the $20 federal backstop, and implement a hiring and budget freeze. Like Ford in Ontario, he will mitigate the federal Liberal campaign’s ability to paint Scheer as scary by keeping provincial Conservative policy out of the headlines. After November, look for major budget cuts in the two provinces.

The Ford government has been anything but quiet.

First there was the fight over Toronto city council and using the notwithstanding clause. There was also things like the plan to allow the greenbelt and other environmental laws to be overridden (backed down on), the autism plan (partly backed down on), the university cuts and now the large increase to high school class sizes.

I hope Albertans get what they need – more and better employment opportunities, continued support for education and health, and an economic plan that is genuinely sustainable and diversified (the days when the province’s lumpenbourgeosie could give their kids summer jobs in oil companies named after the family dog died around the time Tom Tompkins was still an MOR rock DJ. Big Oil is only going to look after Big Oil these days…with maybe Saudi Arabia and Russia thrown in for company.) economy. Alas, I have a sneaking suspicion that Jason Kenney will quickly revert to type. Those of us who saw the Alberta Uber Alles id in full swing during the Klein Years will know that the days of Lougheed’s Heritage Fund will seem positively Maoist if Kenney defaults to his social conservative sweet spot. More likely he will just be another GenX nihilist/populist like Boris Johnson, Jason Rees-Mogg or Nigel Farage…men of the people with very big bank accounts and a tad lite on the values front. Time will tell. Oh well, to echo the Spy list, the mitigating factor is that Alberta is far more progressive than it was in the 80s and 90s and progressives play a long game. The fire next time indeed.

While its Alberta, the fact Kenney tried to connect Notley to Trudeau makes a lot of sense as Trudeau is loathed in Alberta. However if Trudeau thinks this is just an Alberta problem, he might like to look at other provincial results. We now have centre-right governments at the provincial level from the Rockies to Bay of Fundy. Likewise the right is not just dominating rural areas, also winning many suburbs too. Its only your downtown cores of large urban centres going progressive so Trudeau needs to get out of that bubble and find a way to broaden his support. Appealing to the latest social justice cause will win you lots of applauses in the downtown cores where people to cycle to work, you have plenty of vegan restaurants, and yoga is popular, but out in the suburbs where you have married families with children who commute an hour to work every day and rural areas where most drive pick up trucks, it is pocket book issues that win in those areas. Chretien understood this, Trudeau much like Wynne does not.

I think Notley would have lost no matter what as Alberta while changing still remains a centre-right province, but I think if we had a Conservative federal government or a better Liberal one, it would have not been as big a blowout as it was.

Former Chretien communications boss Peter Donolo suggested it was “a mistake in a number of ways.” The Post’s Andrew Coyne cheerfully quoted other pundits, who themselves termed it an “unfathomably stupid move” and “the most ill-advised defamation suit since Oscar Wilde sued the Marquess of Queensbury.”

My personal favourite? Former BC Liberal top guy Martyn Brown, who abandoned all subtlety and simply declared it “batshit crazy,” quote unquote.

In fact, when one checks all known media – and this writer did, as a public service, gratis – it is impossible to find a single sane pundit who thinks Justin Trudeau’s libel lawsuit against Andrew Scheer is in any way defensible.

Oh, wait. Sheila Copps – who says Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are pus-filled “boils,” and who said that Wilson-Raybould had an “aboriginal agenda” and cared more about “aboriginal” jobs – loved Trudeau’s lawsuit.

She thought it was a really good idea, and falsely claimed Scheer retreated after being served with the requisite libel notice (the Conservative leader has in fact repeated the alleged libels, word for word, outside the privileged confines of the House of Commons).

Pro tip, Prime Minister Chewbacca Socks: when Sheila Copps is giving you legal advice, you have well and truly reached bottom. Your octopus is cooked.

Now, this writer teaches media law at the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Law, and previously did so at Carleton University’s School of Journalism. This writer has also been involved in winning defamation cases all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada – cf., Macdonald v. CBC and Kinsella. This writer knows a bit about defamation law.

So, trust me when I say: Justin Trudeau has done many, many stupid things during the three months that LavScam has been a raging political dumpster fire. None, however, is as stupid as his decision to sue Andrew Scheer for telling the truth.

Three reasons.

1. Trudeau’s handed control to Scheer. Justin Trudeau’s apparatchiks on the Justice and Ethics committees shut down any further inquiry on LavScam. They showed Canadians, in effect, that there’s no justice to be found at Trudeau’s Ethics Committee, and no ethics on Trudeau’s Justice Committee.

The Ethics Commissioner’s “investigation,” meanwhile, has been buffeted by illness and possible conflicts of interest. Trudeau is leading a Nixonian-style coverup, ruthlessly crushing any possible legal avenue for Jody Wilson-Raybould to talk about the threats Trudeau directed her way.

So what does Trudeau’s oxymoronic brain trust do? They create a forum for Wilson-Raybould to tell her story – one that Trudeau cannot control. Watch for Scheer to push for Wilson-Raybould to become a witness. It’s coming.

2. Trudeau has alienated many, many media people with his ill-advised stunt. Reporters and editors do not like libel actions, at all. Why? Because they are the people who get sued most often. Media organizations, meanwhile, have spent many millions pushing the courts and lawmakers to adopt a more liberalized defamation law – and they’ve succeeded, to some extent, with the historic case of Grant v. Torstar Corp., back in 2009.

That is why not a single media person – save and except Chief Justice Copps – could be found to applaud Trudeau’s idiotic move. Not even Susan Delacourt, Heather Mallick, Chantal Hebert, Althia Raj or Joyce Napier celebrated Trudeau’s ludicrous litigation. Not even them.

The media have a deeply-held antipathy towards defamation actions, and understandably so. By launching this one, Justin Trudeau has alienated many ink-stained scribes. And he’s helped keep the story alive, now into its third consecutive month.

3. Trudeau may be Canada’s chief law-maker, but he clearly doesn’t understand the law. The thin-skinned Liberal leader’s lawsuit is a classic SLAPP action – a strategic lawsuit against public participation. Laws have been passed in various provinces to slap down SLAPP suits – including the one in which Messrs. Trudeau and Scheer reside, Ontario.

There’s another established part of the law Trudeau doesn’t understand: defences to defamation claims. In this case, all of them arguably apply: fair comment, privilege, and justification – or, truth. Because what the Conservative leader said was demonstrably true: Trudeau, his Minister of Finance, his Principal Secretary, his Chief of Staff, and his senior staff did pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould more than 20 times over a four-month period to help a sleazy Quebec-based donor, SNC-Lavalin, avoid a criminal trial. It’s the truth.

When this writer graduated from law school, he didn’t remember very many cases. He did remember what his criminal law professor recommended clients be told in criminal and quasi-criminal situations. You know, like Justin Trudeau’s LavScam scandal.

I suspect he’ll file the Statement of Claim to preserve it, then do nothing else after that.

If he somehow wins re-election, any judge would say he has no damages – he won the election.

If he loses the election, he’ll be out as Liberal leader, and he’ll be on the hook to pay the bill himself. It’ll stop then, with an NDA in place. Likely.

Fortunately, this is just a protest vote (like the NDP’s ‘big wins’ in Quebec and Alberta). Neither the NDP nor the Greens will form a Canadian federal government in our lifetimes. People may hold their noses and use these two parties to send a message to the Liberals and Conservatives, but when push comes to shove the public is just not dumb enough to hand them the keys to our economy (have you ever *read* a Green platform?

“Your first sentence contradicts your premise. Nobody expected the NDP to win in Alberta or Quebec during our lifetimes, yet they did.”

Well, that was my whole point: they didn’t actually *win*, did they? Not as most of us define winning….they ended up in power by accident, really.

They didn’t go out and campaign hard, win debates and sway people over to their side by the strength and promise of their platform, did they? They didn’t nominate candidates with impressive backgrounds and strong ties to the community. In the case of Quebec, they nominated a few 20-something people who didn’t live in their ridings, some who had no political experience, one who left half-way through the campaign to go on vacation, etc etc. In other words, they WEREN’T EXPECTING TO WIN (and why would they?).

Instead, their opposition collapsed, and they were the unexpected beneficiaries. Happy, yes…but completely stunned anyway. That’s what a protest vote does.

“Why can’t there be a similar protest vote at the federal level?”

Too dangerous, is my guess. People have been known to screw around and cast protest votes quite a bit at the municipal level, not so much at the provincial level and rarely at the federal level. Why? In a word: CONSEQUENCES. Put an idiot in charge of your city finances and the provincial government will bail you out if things go really badly (at least that’s the rationale). Put a fool in charge provincially…well, now you’re talking a lot more money, but the federal government is still there to stave off total collapse and keep you afloat until your economy can recover somewhat. But put one in federally? NOW you’re screwed. Now you’ve got no backup, and no one is coming to bail you out (at least not for free).

That’s my theory, for what it’s worth. I hope it is never tested.
A federal NDP government would make Pierre Trudeau look like Ebenezer Scrooge (or Scrooge McDuck, if you like:).

.. something tends to move into most voids ..
Hence Ontario has a Premier named Doug Ford.. the Liberal collapse and Wynne’s white flag left such a void. In the US of A Trump et al oozed into the void of ‘its my turn’ Hillary. Same in sorryassed Alberta. Kenney did the Harper rebrand evangel ‘Advantage’ grift and petro void welcomed his ascension or ooze move

Was there a valid explanation from Nate or not? As you say though.. what are your options? Wh0 has our holy evangel fathers, the Conservatives offered as candidate? The NDP drifting twould seem? Green may be feeling their oats.. hell n damnation but there is a mighty void to step smartly into.

But I think Nate is safe.. he works his riding. The Great Trudeau Lavalin Conundrum will smack many a Liberal we thinks.. thus giving Ottawa boy Scheer a ridiculous opportunity he doesn’t deserve.

An aside.. it seems Albertans have bought into the provincial and federal Harper Rump – Economic Theory.. ejecting Ms Notely & NDP to return the Harper Dogma UCP dregs to power. The economic theory seemingly includes accumulating such a vast and astonishing Sovereign Remediation Debt (260 billion $$) that Alberta tax payers may have to cover it, instead of the polluters! Thus toxin leaching tar sands tailings ponds, leaking orphan & abandoned oil wells, fracking sites, derelict infrastructure, toxic boreal forest dump sites etc will almost certainly be ‘written off’ – never to be remediated. Jason Of Arc Kenney won’t even read the Alberta Energy Regulater report says he.. probably planning to just use retroactive legislation & the Never You Mind NotWithStanding Clause gambit.. to make it all ‘go away’. Seemingly, Trudeau & his Environment Minister etc lean this way as well.. and since most MainstreamMedia prove every day that they believe the myth that diluted bitumin is ‘Alberta oil’.. its best the extraction for export be expanded toute suite.. and so subsidize expansion with tax dollars.. and forget any Remediation. Lavalin has a share in TMX and Site C too.. so its all a big happy political family pre election …. (.. haha.. not !!)

Peter Bevan-Baker deserves this! I knew him as a dentist in small Prescott Ontario in the 80s and 90s. He was a disciple of the green lifestyle when green was just a colour, not a movement. He has put in the work. Walked the walk. He certainly stands out as an example of someone who wants to govern not just be a politician.

One of my biggest beefs these days, especially insofar as the whole FordNation bullshit goes, is that the opponents to local winners of the provincial politics have disappeared. Where is Dave Henderson, former mayor of Brockville who opposed Steve Clark, now the Minister of Municipal Affairs. While FordNation rapes the province and Steve’s shiny bald head appears at every event from envelope opening to maple syrup testing, none of the candidates who would have had us believe they wanted to actually DO something for us has spoken up. They have retreated to oblivion leaving us to fend for ourselves.

I can tell you, Peter Bevan-Baker hasd fought the fight. I know because I didn’t vote for him in a bunch of elections and yet I always knew what he was up to. He never won anything around me but I always knew where he was and what he was thinking. He actually wants to govern. He actually WILL govern. Good on him.

As for the rest of this sorry lot, from Trudeau Liberals to Scheer Conservatives to Doug and the Slugs, I’ve had it. I’m with Warren. He couldn’t have highlighted a better example of someone with class, dignity and our better interests in mind who will, absolutely WILL, make a difference in Canada

PEI shows Canada the way! The “way” to what? Economic ruin for Canada is my prediction if elected federally.
Eliz. May on the Green website says “Canada is teetering on a recession for the second time since Stephen Harper became prime minister. His ill-advised political pledge to eliminate the deficit he created, just in time for this election, is now risking a deepening recession.”
Of course, it’s Harper’s fault. Everything is Harper’s fault. She’s shrewd not to offend JT! She knows the Greens may well hold the balance of power in the next election and a coalition with JT may just be her reality.
Yes, shut down all the oil fields with huge taxation. Drive away the big corps. with big taxes. And spend, spend, spend since neither JT or May believe deficits are problematic there is nirvana on the horizon for Canadians to be bought with their own money. Or rather their children’s money!
Realize, voting for the Greens means voting in JT.

I’m involved with the PEI PC Party and we don’t see the Greens being *that* strong. That being said, the polls could very well be true however n = 400/500 doesn’t have me (personally) convinced. This all being said, I could be very wrong too. There should be many tight races particularly with many incumbent Liberals not re-offering, which, from what I’m hearing, is because the premier is a dictatorial figure and many MLAs were at odds with top staff internally. The only hot take you can get from me is that the Liberal premier Wade MacLaughlin will lose his own seat to PC Bloyce Thompson.

You guys sure vote weird down east. Your MP is a nothing, a nobody just like Trudeau Sr said. They have as much power and influence as your doorstop. Who cares who they are. The PM is the power in this country and he carries the policy. That’s how an event like SNC Lavalin happens without 180 other MPs knowing whats going on. That would never happen in a US Congress. We have a defacto dictatorship.

So the choice is on policy, not people. I choose less govt because govt is ineffective, overreaching and incompetent and we have proof of that right from Trudeaus own cabal. I choose the opposite of that and CPC is the only one that offers that vision. Greens and NDP are just more Marxists Socialist constructs like Trudeau.

That’s not the story as I understand it. The feds played a small in the early days – certainly not the beginning- taking over a refinery that soon failed circa 1943 (during the war oil security was a big deal – one wonders if they did it under Britain’s direction much as Canada did re nuclear)

The Alberta government got pissed at how inept the feds were sometime in the late forties and the feds were never involved to any significant degree thereafter.

By and large the feds have been a massive impediment to oilsands and Permian development- the NEB and pipeline (and now bill 69?) being just two of the bigger examples.

The Republicans never wanted a life-long Democrat to lead their party. Think back to how hard they tried to block his nomination.

Donald Trump is only a Republican because the Democrats, who he supported for 30 years or so (he donated to Hillary, remember?) had a process in place that was able to block him from being chosen as their candidate, while the Republicans, as I understand it, use a different system and were unable to stop him.

Once he won, of course, most of the GOP pretended to embrace him for the sake of staying in power. I suspect that most still don’t like him no matter what they may say in public…and of course there are still those who are openly hostile to him as well.

Will be interesting to see what happens. Due to its small population PEI tends to be underpolled, although I do think Greens are favoured here. Only question mark is it seems in last few years parties on the political right often overperform polls so if the PCs have a similar overperformance to what the CAQ and UCP did, they would win a majority, while if similar to Ontario PCs, it would be a nail biter. Off course all three parties are fairly centrist so not sure that will play out as well as turnout tends to be higher in PEI than other provinces. The main reason I think right outperforms is their voters are more motivated to show up than left, not because pollsters are necessarily getting it wrong, just who shows up.

But Andrew is saying that to “say no” to JT is to vote CONSERVATIVE.
Andrew will have to convince Canadians of that. It doesn’t sound like Warren Kinsella is convinced.
Previous Liberal voters need to do some soul searching and put principle before party loyalty if they aren’t going to like the present Liberal caucus. JT has proven to be without principle. The October election should be about principle.
For me, Andrew’s bench has some decent potential ministers that I can support. JT’s bench has failed to stand for principle except for three women who have left.
Other parties? I will need convincing. But I can’t vote for May… just can’t.

Really? Does he make up funny little cartoon pictures of people and put devil horns and pig ears on them? And insert those cartoon balloons to make them say hurtful, hateful things? Does he call all Canadian news media “the Con Media”? Call everyone who disagrees with him loathsome, despicable, repulsive and evil? Does he call a certain someone “Wornout” or “Kinsellout” and a “Conservative shill” every chance he gets, and participate in discussions with others about how to get that someone *kicked off* the Progressive Bloggers because he dares to entertain criticisms of the sainted Justin Trudeau?

(he failed… Scott Tribe sent him a nice email explaining how someone’s opinion of this current scandal (or “fake scandal”, as it is labelled in every one of Simon’s posts) does not necessarily make that someone a Conservative plant, sorry…)

Does he insist on calling JWR and JP “the two Connies”, and state his firm belief that they are actually working at the direction of the evil Andrew Sheer to undermine JT and bring down the Liberal government? Does he do any of that?

At least Andrew Scheer, like him or not (I don’t) is a grownup. Montreal Simon is a petulant child with delusions of grandeur…

Very good ad. I think the deficit stuff should be moved up first though. The JWR stuff is a bit procedural for a fast moving political ad and I don’t think Joe and Jane front porch really get it. Andrew Scheer is more prepared to become PM than any Conservative Leader in the last 100 years. This is totally his election to lose.

Completely agree. The only people more pathetic than the accusers are those who actually vote based on this sort of stuff.

And before anyone says “oh, that’s not me”, think about the factors that go into your voting decision. If any of that consideration is because you have a negative perception of the party based on these sort of accusations, then yes – you are part of the pathetic parade.

Sadly, from door-knocking for candidates over the years and speaking to voters, I’ve learned that many people vote based on this stuff. Which is why political parties keep doing it.

People will spend hours binge-watching trash television, but they won’t spend an hour watching a proper newscast or reading a newspaper. Instead, they get their political “insight” based on sound bytes, headlines, and conversations with friends.

Canada has been badly served by both major parties these past two decades. and the dumbos they put in charge reflect the fact that power and influence is their priority, and what the public needs can go hang. I neither need a social pariah like harper and his follow-up minions changing Canada for ever, for reasons never explained, or a little blighter who made over 300 promises to get elected then reneged on 99% of them.

“Warren, you rock. I totally agree that Islamophobia is as bad as pedophilia.”

Warren didn’t say that (and, no, it’s not).

“A lot of politicians were too cowardly to condemn Islamophobia during the m103 debate ”

No, they were too principled. “Islamophobia” is a politically-charged, loaded term invented for the sole purpose of telling people to “SHUT UP!” whenever they try to discuss Islam in less than flattering terms. It was invented to intimidate and bully people into silence, and yet supporters turn a blind eye to its unintended effect of downplaying and marginalizing hatred (*real* hatred) directed against other religious groups; why don’t they get their own ‘phobia’? Why only Islam?

To use the word “Islamophobia” is to engage in dog-whistle politics and fearmongering . You yourself are a perfect example: why do you never post on any other subject here?

415,Warren Kinsella,How Trudeau elected Kenney,2019-04-23 06:42:00,Warren,,"Last month, I was back home in Calgary to teach at the law school. So, I got together with a couple high school buddies – one a lawyer, one an engineer – at Michael’s on Tenth Avenue. (Michael’s has the best pizza in Canada, by the way. Hands down.)

We got to talking about the coming Alberta election, and what was going to happen. Some people at neighbouring tables chimed in. (Calgary’s like that.)

Here’s a summary of what I was told:
• they all respected Rachel Notley but disliked her party
• they didn’t really like Jason Kenney but figured they’d vote for his party
• they thought the rest of Canada didn’t give a shit about them
• they deeply hated Justin Trudeau

And when I say “deeply,” I mean deeply. One of my fellow Michael’s fans even suggested that it would be a bad idea for Trudeau to travel to Alberta. Because he might be placed at physical risk.

Seriously.

The conversation continued. My lawyer buddy, who works at a major construction and engineering firm, was unhappy about Trudeau’s slavish devotion to the fortunes of the oily Quebec-based construction and engineering firm, SNC-Lavalin. He looked at me.

“You know, Winkie,” he said, using the nickname my Calgary pals gave to me way back when, “My firm had to lay off more than a thousand guys last year. No one back East noticed. No one. If that had happened to SNC-Lavalin, it would’ve been all you’d hear about.”

He was right, of course. Albertans are right: if something bad happens in the Centre of the Universe, in the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto axis, the whole country hears about it for weeks. But if hundreds of families lose their livelihood in Calgary, nobody in Ontario gives a shit, basically. Certainly not Justin Trudeau, who has repeatedly claimed to support Alberta – and then repeatedly done precisely nothing to help Alberta get oil to market.

I later tweeted what my friend said about those layoffs, and Ontario and Quebec’s total indifference to same. Jason Kenney was one of the many who retweeted what I said. It struck a chord.

And that, really, is mainly why Jason Kenney swept the much-admired Rachel Notley from power. Because Justin Trudeau and his government are now more despised in Alberta than was Trudeau’s father’s government, way back during the nadir of the National Energy Program. And Notley is seen, in Alberta, as having letting Trudeau get away with murder. The murder of Alberta’s economy.

Other factors were at play in last Tuesday’s night vote, of course. In politics, there always are. Jason Kenney brought together the warring factions of the Right, and avoided the vote-splits that helped Notley’s Crüe sweep to power four years ago. And, while the NDP leader was herself admired, her caucus generally was not. Notley had a Safeway employee, a yoga instructor and a bunch of twenty-somethings. Few had real political experience.

In 2015, Notley’s Progressive Conservative opponents also ran one of the worst campaigns in modern Alberta history. Nationally, the NDP was polling respectably in 2014. And Notley’s family was (and is) admired in Alberta. Her Dad was a much-loved former MLA who died tragically in a plane crash in 1984.

But, mostly, Rachel Notley lost because of Justin Trudeau. She trusted him, as did other Albertans. And she shouldn’t have. His early promises to Alberta were deceptions. They were intended to win him seats – but Trudeau clearly never had any intention of helping Alberta families survive.

My engineer buddy, who has had to lay off dozens of engineers, and take whatever work he can get, nods grimly at all this. He was born in Montreal, grew up in Manitoba and Alberta, and was always a Liberal. No more.

“He’s a liar,” my friends says, holding a glass of the best local stuff, Trad. “He’s a goddamn liar. He’s way more hated than his father ever was, in Alberta. And Notley is the one who is going to wear it.”

That was unfortunate, my engineering pal said, because he regarded Rachel Notley as “decent, smart and principled.” Many people in Alberta admired the NDP Premier, he said.

“But she was unlucky. She won when the bottom was falling out,” he said. “That’s not her fault. But her alliance with Trudeau, at the start, is something people will never forgive.”

And they didn’t. Once again, anything with the “Liberal” brand is anathema in Alberta, thanks to Justin Trudeau. On election night, the Alberta Liberal leader – a smart, hard-working constitutional lawyer, David Khan – was creamed, finishing a distant fourth in Calgary MountainView. His party was wiped out across the province, not winning a single seat.

Justin Trudeau may not have been on the ballot in Alberta, but he surely helped determine the result, more than any other Canadian politician. He helped elect Jason Kenney and defeat Rachel Notley. He did that.

My engineering buddy looked at me.

I think it a stretch to say JT is more hated than his father was. The shock that the NEP and shortly after a crash in oil prices caused was far far worse than the current harm caused by JTs failure to perform his constitutional duty on pipelines.

Making it even worse were the very high interest rates – 15+ percent – that caused people and businesses to make drastic cuts to spending far faster than in today’s sub 4% world.

Pile in that the fact that the NEP reduced revenues in AB while providing Ontario and Quebec oil and gas at prices significantly below the world price – over 100 billion in imputed subsidy in 1980s dollars – and the (justifiable) hate on PET was white hot.

JT by comparison is seen as a virtue-signalling doofus who is completely out of his league politically and thus is a threat to Alberta and other provinces that provide oil and gas and coal to the world.

What albertans hate far more today than they did back in the day is the MSM and academia and their commanders the progressive left and their totalitarianism. And if you think things are bad now just wait and see what the response will be if Bill 69 is passed.

That is sort of my read too – in this era of social media, we collectively do hatred a little more readily than back then. But I don’t think this has the same deep, generational roots as the effects of the NEP did. Alberta has had a rough time over the past few years, as oil capital spending and exploration ground to a halt. However, most Albertans now don’t really have a good grasp of just how grim the early 80s were there.

.. let us do a check.. how many barrels of ‘Alberta oil’ or gas and of what grade, actually travel daily from Alberta to Quebec and Ontario. Please differentiate Dilbit or Synbit thanks, versus any ‘conventional’ oil. Ontario buys a hell of a lot of gas BTW from Pennsylvania.. and last i looked it was mainly synbit being piped anywhere east.. The Great Canadian ‘oil’ Grift is fueled by misinformation and lazy conflation of words, terms, phrases. We particularly like the quaint term ‘oil patch’ ..

Which comes first? The chicken or the egg?

In this case it’s the pipeline that comes first.

And yes, there was/is no need for an eastern pipeline if the feds will do their job and get several lines to pacific tidewater where the demand and thus price for oil and gas is far higher than Atlantic tidewater (and pacific rim demand is going to get even stronger while the European market stagnates and maybe even declines)

Energy east at least had provinces that were willing to let a pipeline be built – at least until Quebec got on its high, money grifting horse.

But since the LPC Hasn’t the guts to do its job we have no new Pipe either east or west.

Agree with the article otherwise, but needed to comment on your suggestion that a “Safeway employee” could not do a good job as an MLA.

Recall that one of the most popular and hard working MPs elected during the 2011 NDP “orange wave” was Ruth Ellen Brosseau, who worked previously in a bar and who was famously vacationing in Los Vegas during the campaign.

She was respected by her constituents and was re-elected in 2015 with an increase in the percentage of the vote, even as the rest of the NDP lost many seats in Quebec.

I am sure there are other similar examples.

I don’t know anything about the Safeway MLA in question, but I don’t think that we should malign people based on their previous employment. Not everyone has the opportunity or interest to attend university, but can be quite capable and hard working nevertheless.

I have no problem with someone with no political experience running for office, if they have work experience.

Justin Trudeau had a name, but no political experience. His work experience was essentially non-existent. His ideas of leadership are a joke, and possibly came from a PowerPoint someone gave him.

He wasn’t ready. He still isn’t ready. He’s gone from magazine covers to a dufus on the Simpsons.

I have strong feeling that Trudeau is going to run against Kenney and Alberta in October. If he does he election will be a referendum on Alberta. You may not think so but Albertans will. If Trudeau wins based on that strategy I think you know that the Alberta referendum of Oct 21 may have a different question than equalization.

The true divide and (they think) conquer party is the LPC.

They continue to see the country east and west of the laurentians as hinterland – that centralized markets, banking and governance are the way forward (and guess who’s father championed that back in the day?).

And they are wrong. If a majority of Canadians think that that is the way forward too in time there will be fewer people calling themselves Canadian.

That’s what always royally pissed me off about Trudeau Sr. He was a stinking hypocrite on the issue of national unity. He constantly portrayed himself as the Champion of National Unity while cynically pitting central Canada against the West for political gain. The uber-polarized electoral maps of 1979 and 1980 were the direct result of that strategy.

Jim Coutts and Keith Davey also bear responsibility for that.

The sad fact is that the federal Liberals have never really suffered that much from being politically toxic in Alberta. Look at those results from the Trudeau comeback election of the early 1980s. It looks like we may have a similarly polarized map in the next federal election.

And you know that Trudeau and his advisors are doubling down on sucking up to Quebec and paying lip service at best to Alberta. That’s the most viable road to victory that they see, and that’s been the case for some time now. Trudeau & Co. look at those NDP seats in Quebec and they get a big political woody. They figure they’ll flip those seats and that will offset any possible losses in places like Alberta and BC (where they don’t have all that much to lose anyway).

It’s kind of depressing how little has changed in that regard in some 30-40 years of Canadian federal politics.

The lesson the LPC needs to learn – or rather the thing it needs to decide is: 

Are they the party of the Old Canada or the New Canada?

Several years ago Michael Bliss wrote of the New Canada west of Ontario – how it was the dynamic future of the country – that part that prefers less government and believes in free(r) trade and lower taxes and less interference in their daily lives.

Clearly there are pockets of the Old Canada all across Canada but the political density is far lower in Western Canada.

And I would expand that New Canada to include much of Ontario.

The LPC continues to pander to the Old Canada – that which parochial ethos (that dates back to the disatrous decision to not join in the American Revolution) is inward looking, politically constipated and fearful of the future. They throw money at them, pick winners and generally politicize spending (as do the provinces in the Old Canada). And the Old Canada votes for them.

But the population growth is overwhelmingly in the New Canada – the demographic shifts have been huge – and the LPC panders to the Old Canada and abuses the New Canada at its political peril in the years to come.

That is the Lesson – not just of Kenney, but of Ford, Pallister and Moe. And that block of Conservatives now represents more than 50% of the country’s population.

Will the LPC decide in time to break with the Old Canada or will it do what PMSH failed to do and die except by its own political hand?

If a province wishes to do that is is the federal government’s CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY to facilitate it.

Many years ago one of the founders of OPEC – Sheik Yemeni wisely and famously said “the Stone Age didn’t end because we ran out of stones.”

Canada has centuries worth of oil and millennias worth of coal and natural gas reserves. The world currently wants those resources. It is idiotic and self -destructive (not the first time I admit) for Canadian and provincial governments to prevent us from getting them to market.

We are making generations upon generations of future Canadians poorer by doing so.

And that is to say nothing of the fact that the confederation itself is at risk if it isn’t done.

The globe consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day and is based on OPEC calculations (they like to model these things) indicate we will be consuming 110 million barrels in 2040. Now Canadians may decide as you suggest to only be consumers rather than producers. However that will not be Alberta’s perspective and we will not be capitulating. Should Canadians decide in Oct that they support C69, C48, a cap on oil production, no pipelines in any direction we, meaning Albertans, may find a jurisdiction nearby with lower taxes, less regulation and support for oil and gas production. They might actually appreciate the worlds 3rd greatest oil reserves. You can decide when you vote

I am an old Torontian who moved to Alberta 10 years ago before turning 30.

I’ve learned to love Western Canada values, because out here you are only as good as your word.

I was a lefty in Ontario, who believed that government and Unions are required to help people enter middle class.

Alberta has made me realize how free markets is the best path forward. Best path for prosperity, and most importantly workplace safety. (Yes it sounds cheesy.)

I love Warrens Article here, because he is talking about people like me, and is giving people like me a voice. As the megaphone is usually dominated by zealots who want the pipeline to die.

I am enjoying the thoughtful comments being written here, I particularly like your comment about Old and New Canada.

(I don’t think Ontario is at all related to the new Canada. Though)

I would like to mention that New Canada is where LavScam has taken Trudeau polling numbers down the most. Particularly in BC, as his number where already very low in the Prairies. That is what is being ignored in my eyes, is that New Canada is way more fed up about LavScam than the East.

As well, JWR stance represented New Canada values that conflicted with Old Canada old boys club.

And I feel that all along Trudeau’s mandate is to try and return Quebec to being economically powerful within Canada. Which won’t happen, but he continues to hurt New Canada thinking he can achieve this goal.

So, it’s not going to be good and nothing he can do between now and October can change that one whit.

I think Notley was in trouble the moment the right united, nonetheless Trudeau made the loss worse. The ridings the NDP won on perfect three way splits, they were going to lose no matter what, but if Trudeau wasn’t so unpopular in Alberta, I think the NDP could have held onto the 41% they got in 2015 and the UCP probably would have fallen short of the combined 52% the Wildrose + PCs got rather than exceeding it. PCs and Wildrose have strong differences but they are united in their hatred of Trudeau. So Trudeau may be didn’t cost her the election per se, but made the loss worse and also put the NDP in a very difficult position to come back in 2023.

Can’t tell if you are being serious.

The Gap between The price AB gets for its oil and what it would be getting if there was sufficient pipeline capacity has ranged as high as 40$/BBL. At 3.6 MM per day of production that’s $144 million in lost revenues EVERY DAY because of political cowardice on the part of the LPC (and the AB NDP).

Yes.

It won’t address the long term issues of a broken equalization formula which incentivizes cheating (Quebec And MB) and discourages resource development producing revenues but rather government bloat (NL) and EI and Senate reform. But essentially it is the lack of pipeline capacity that is constricting prices and postponing further production growth

Depending on who you talk to that’s Adding 150K BBL / day of new supply every year and between 250 and500 billion in direct capital expenditures over the next decade and over a trillion in indirect cap spending on housing etc.

And that doesn’t include the huge NG potential. The first phase of kitimat lng is $40 billion in capex and they just formally applied to build a second phase that is of similar scale.

So Yes. The answer is emphatically “yes”.

Thank you for this post.

A big factor come next election is that a lot of young Canadians migrated to Alberta. And have been indoctrinated by Trudeau into resenting Western Alienation, the same Western Alienation being championed by Trudeau.

The under forty crowd are sending this message to their parents and friends back home, that Western Alienation is real and rightly pin it on Trudeau. (Note the polls dropped directly after Christmas.)

So unlike the NEP in the 80’s, Western Canada now holds much more of the population, and has stronger l relations to family and friends out east.

This under 40 age group of Canadians might influence the vote out east just enough come election time with their evidence of Western Alienation.

The West is King in this country. The economic might of Canada has and will increasingly shift westward. The West is also the demographics King: with every federal election, the West gains additional seats and that will continue for many, many, future election cycles.

So, Alberta is hurting terribly but to butcher Laurier: the 21st Century belongs to the West. That’s the Canadian reality going forward.

Put another way: it’s their turn to run this nation. And that can only favour the Conservatives, regardless of who sits in the leader’s chair.

It does not need to be that way. NL has over 40 billion Bbls of oil and quads of NG. NS has loads of potential as well. Quebec squanders opportunity in so many ways. These provinces all dramatically underperform because of left-wing, entitlement politics. Changes to equalization and EI would go a long way to changing that. Stay tuned…

Notley is perhaps one of the smartest politicians in the country, but she comes with an excess of baggage. Once elected she had to represent all Albertans. Her baggage didn’t allow for that to happen.

The internet is full of Notley pictures of her protesting at pipeline rallies and making speeches vilifying the O&G industry. As premier she couldn’t shake her past. She tried but it was just too much to overcome. Albertan’s weren’t taken in by her and doubted her sincerity.

As for experience, Trudeau himself is the best example of who not to elect. He brought nothing to the table by way of experience in either a career or life itself. His cabinet is much a refection of himself. Have we ever had such a mess in foreign affairs? Our stellar reputation has been sullied perhaps beyond repair. It is a tragedy.

I was around during T1’s reign of terror in AB. As Gord Tulk points out above this time it’s not as severe….yet. T2 had instant name recognition in AB but not instant dislike. Albertan’s were willing to give him a chance, hell they elected 4 liberals. He never attempted to curry favour with the Province and his distain for us quickly became evident.

Kenney who is also one of the smartest politicians the country has produced easily tied Notely to Trudeau. The connection was obvious to the electorate.

Notley had her chance. Her past and ideology couldn’t free her to do the right thing. I think Albertan’s would have embraced another term but she herself couldn’t embrace Alberta.

abtrapper. I had just arrived in AB from Toronto in 1980, was a Liberal and “rightly” presumed the oil belonged to Canada. I was a Conservative by 1982. The difference between T1 and T2 is the AB government of the times. Obviously Lougheed supported Albertans and the O&G Industry. Between T1 and T2 we had many downturns in the price of oil. I certainly recall $11.00. However we never had an Alberta government that wanted to destroy the industry while it was down. Notley used the opportunity of lower prices to increase corporate taxes by 20% (10 to 12), implement a greater carbon tax and never fight for the interests of non union workers. Consider the recent election results. I would suggest that 80% of those who voted for the NDP were private and public union members or their partners. 80% of those who voted for the UCP were non union members. We can’t let the unions take over the province again. I understand Rachel has retrieved her Che Guevara watch from her dresser drawer. She is a Marxist not a socialist.

There is a common belief that the Canadian system of determining judges is superior to the U.S. version. This latest revelation is further proof of how wrong that belief is.

In the U.S., it is unabashedly political – but at least you know exactly who you’re getting. Each candidate’s views are aired for all to see. In Canada, it is equally political, but much less is subject to public scrutiny. In Canada we have this (incorrect) view that judges are appointed based on their merits, whereas in reality it is who they know and whose palms they grease. I know a number of lawyers who have, for years, decried the back-door aspect of the Canadian judicial appointment system.

In their heart of hearts, they all know it and are basically simply going through the motions. It dawned on most, if not all of them, after JWR and JP were unceremoniously given the caucus boot.

Something doesn’t add up about this story. All you need to do is go to the Elections Canada website and you can do a name search of the donation history of anyone who has donated more than $200 in the last 15 years. Why do you need a “Liberalist” data base for something publicly available?

Because when you do a search on the Elections Canada website the government, and leaky officials in government, have a record of what you were searching for. And we can’t have people knowing what the Liberals are up to!

Gee, I wonder why Canadian conservatives (small-c and big-C) don’t trust judges?

I’m surprised that nobody has really run with the fact that Butts apparently suggested that JWR get an ‘outside’ opinion from retired CJC Beverly McLachlin about the decision to refuse a DPA for SNC-Lava, and when JWR’s chief of staff asked him what would happen if the opinion said the AG couldn’t review the decision, Butts apparently told her “It wouldn’t say that.”

Sure sounds to me like the fix was in.

I know someone who became a judge back in the 90s. He was very open about how it worked. He volunteered for the CPs, went door to door during elections, attended events, donated, did whatever the party wanted, and in return expected a judgeship. He was very angry when there was a delay and it looked like he might not get it before the CPs lost power, and then he would have to wait a decade or more until they got back in. Luckily for him, they did manage to get him that judgeship before they were voted out.

The Liberals are now the third party in three provinces – PEI, Ontario and Manitoba and have no seats in Sask or Alberta and don’t really exist in either province. Their provincial weakness is a very bad sign for them.

The Liberals were the Official Opposition in Alberta until 2012. Last week they got 0.98% of the vote. That’s 18,000 votes. Total. In the entire province. Just barely ahead of the Alberta Independence Party at 13,500. The leader, running in the only seat they held going into the election, finished fourth with 7% of the vote.

To put this in historical context, their previous low-water mark was in 1982, when the Grits were running against Peter Lougheed (who was more popular than God) with the albatross of PET and the NEP. Even then they managed nearly double the vote percentage they did last week.

Two observations:
1) Is the Liberal decline a symptom of the political polarization happening in most developed countries? Canada seems to be following the path towards well differentiated parties to the left and right of centre

2) Is the Green vote a protest against phenomenon 1? I have yet to uncover convincing reasons to vote Green even though I really want to find some

Frankly, this is no surprise for me. PEI was always in our minds Fortress Liberal — but when this PM went there and got booed, that was a flashing RED LED-sign.

When you get booed by the public, you are in very serious political trouble. When some of your own supporters chime in, at the margins, you’re finished.

Keep an eye out for this in the federal campaign.

I think on polls underestimating conservative vote, I actually think polls are right, where they are wrong is its not what the public as a whole thinks that matters, its what those who show up to vote on election day think. And here is something some are missing, conservatives are very angry and motivated. Otherwise no matter how inconvenient they will show up on election day and often elections are won and lost by which side is more motivated to show up. Right now unlike in 2015, conservatives are a lot more fired up than progressives are.

Another thing that the polls don’t reflect is a party’s ground game. The PC’s on the Island have been in a bit of a political wilderness for a time, but they still have an established, widespread party infrastructure, while the Greens haven’t developed a comparable one yet. They were also able to pull in help from the other PC parties in ND and NB.
In the end, they were more efficient at getting out the vote.

What is fascinating about the PEI election is that the PCs got a slightly lower percentage of the votes than in 2015 but still won a majority. Four years ago they won 37.39%, while in 2019 they got 36.52%. A vote split between the Greens and the Liberals, however, let the Tories win a majority. This tells me Scheer has a good chance of winning in October.

Actually there are 3 Liberal governments as Yukon has one, but that could fall to two next May if Liberals lose Newfoundland. Interesting tidbit is in December 2015, 7 out of 10 provinces with over 80% of the population had provincial governments with Liberal monikers and 6 out of 10 representing 2/3 of the population had small l liberal (BC Liberals are more conservative than liberal) ones and then two NDP ones. Today 7 out of 10 representing over 80% of Canadians are small c conservative while only 2 provinces with Liberals and less than 5%. Usually when governments change federally, provincial go the other way to balance things out, but not usually this dramatically and this quickly. It wasn’t until the final year of Harper being in office that it even came close to that. Likewise it was in the final two years for Trudeau sr., and Mulroney faced similar situations. One exception is Chretien going into 2000 only had one provincial Liberal government (Newfoundland) bucked the trend.

What should be more worrisome to Trudeau is Nanos asks each week on each leader do they have good qualities to be a leader. It is 44% yes for Trudeau, 40% No. For comparison Harper never fell below 50% yes and never above 40% no, so on this matrix Trudeau is doing worse than Harper and after 4 years only, not a decade.

410,Warren Kinsella,100 days of #LavScam: Trudeau has defeated himself,2019-04-29 06:36:00,Warren,,"One hundred days.



A lot can happen in 100 days. Because, per the saying, a week can be a lifetime in politics.



One hundred or so days ago, Justin Trudeau fired Jody Wilson-Raybould. One hundred days ago, the Liberal leader – the one who claimed to be feminist, the one who declared himself the champion of indigenous causes, and the ethical epitome – terminated Wilson-Raybould because she refused to do what he wanted her to.



Because she – a proud, smart, courageous indigenous woman – refused to interfere in the criminal prosecution of a sleazy Quebec company facing innumerable corruption charges. Because she had the guts and the principles to say “no” to a bunch of men who wouldn’t take no for an answer.



In the 100 days that have gone by since January 14, 2019, everything has changed. The guaranteed second Trudeau majority? Gone. Polls now say Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are ahead – or way ahead. Trudeau, meanwhile, is viscerally disliked pretty much everywhere outside of Quebec.



Hell, in Prince Edward Island’s just-finished election, Liberals told Trudeau to stay away, because his very name was dragging them down. The PEI Grits still finished a distant third, a rump, behind the Tories – and the Greens!



Out in Alberta, most observers agree that Jason Kenney won a majority – and Rachel Notley lost a majority – because the latter leader had gotten too close to Trudeau. And because the former leader had done all he could to associate Notley with Trudeau. (It worked.)



In the hundred days since Justin Trudeau politically lynched Jody Wilson-Raybould, plenty of other things have happened, too.


The Globe and Mail published a series of stories detailing Trudeau’s apparent efforts to obstruct justice to help out SBC-Lavalin. Trudeau called the stories fake. But all of the Globe’s stories turned out to be true. Every word.
Trudeau insisted he didn’t fire Wilson-Raybould from the job she loved – from the job she was great at. He said her continued presence in cabinet was proof. A day later, Wilson-Raybould quit his cabinet.
The clowns on the Justice Committee refused to let Wilson-Raybould testify about LavScam. After a tsunami of political blowback, they reversed themselves.
But the committee’s Liberal trained seals – and Trudeau – refused to let Wilson-Raybould testify about what Trudeau said and did after that fateful cabinet shuffle. When, sources tell me, Trudeau threatened recriminations, and promised rewards, when he spoke to his former Minister of Justice.
Trudeau’s best friend and principal secretary – and the Clerk of his Privy Council – are both implicated in the metastasizing LavScam scandal. Both insisted they did nothing wrong. But both abruptly resigned.
The Liberals defeated each and every Opposition attempt to get the truth. At the Ethics Committee, in the Justice Committee, in the House of Commons: in vote after vote, the panicked Grits continued to coverup. They continued to stonewall.
PMO trotted out obscure Liberal backbenchers and banshees to defame and demean Jody Wilson-Raybould and her ally, Jane Philpott – who had resigned cabinet because she could no longer go along with the Trudeaupian sleaze. One PMO attack poodle, Sheila Copps, actually calls Wilson-Raybould and Philpott pus-filled “boils.”



And on, and on. A hundred days later – a hundred days after he made the insane decision to martyr Jody Wilson-Raybould – pollsters say Justin Trudeau is heading towards inevitable defeat.



Of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott? The other parties are trying convince the pair to run for them.



Jody, polls say, is believed and supported by the vast majority of Canadians.



And, one hundred fateful days later, Justin just isn’t","<div class=""articlecontent"">

60 days at least which should have been spent on setting leadership convention timelines, electing delegates, launching campaigns, re-energizing the base, giving people hope and inspiration. All wasted because PM Zoolander and his gang of incompetent scumbags refuse to accept reality.

That’s approximately where I stand. From what I’m to understand, my Liberal MP is actually pretty good and useful, but he stood by caucus through all this so I can’t vote for him. Had Trudeau stepped aside, LPC could have possibly rescued this one vote anyway. Alas, I see no pathway to me voting red.

Ditto. Nate Erskine Smith raised my hopes – then dashed them. He went along with the biggest coverup in recent Canadian history.

Wherever JWR and JP go, that’s where my vote will go.

When they turfed those MPs, that killed the possibility of me voting Liberal. They knew yours truly and countless others would react that way — and they did it anyway because of a bunch of entitled maximum pension seekers. All caucus cares about is the $$$.

Chretien during flooding in 97 didn’t really rub the west the wrong way from my recollection. So he threw a sandbag and took off. I don’t remember him shilling for a photo op, stopping work and ordering military to stand for a picture.

My trouble with Chretien was never economics or the way he ran the country. He signed Kyoto but I dont remember him saying the oil industry had to be sacrificed. When he used stimulus to get the economy going many small town projects got built in Canada. You could see the money put to work, then he went after the deficit which I always loved. But I always had a problem with the professionalism of his communication which was severely lacking due to his accent and other language issues. I felt that made Canada look bad, but nothing compared to the destructive swath that Trudeau and his bandits have unleashed.

“He signed Kyoto but I dont remember him saying the oil industry had to be sacrificed.”

That’s because he didn’t actually do much to reduce emissions.

That “doing worse” number is brutal.

This:
A new poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press suggests the governing federal Liberals have lost ground to the Conservatives over the past month.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 12 per cent said they would vote NDP and eight per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As for the budget, which the Liberals are hoping will help turn the page on SNC-Lavalin, 12 per cent of respondents said it was good and 19 per cent that it was bad, but 39 per cent said they didn’t really know about it.

And this:
OTTAWA — A new online poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press suggests the Trudeau Liberals haven’t convinced Canadians the country is doing better under their stewardship.

In all 46 per cent of respondents said Canada is doing worse since Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government was elected in 2015, while only 22 per cent believed the country is doing better and 27 per cent said things are the same.

Leger’s executive vice-president Christian Bourque said these numbers come despite economic indicators showing the country’s economy is performing better than in 2015.

Regional concerns particularly in Western Canada over the state of the oil and gas industry, are affecting the way voters are viewing the overall state of the country, Bourque said.

“In Alberta, for example, we see that 59 per cent of people believe Canada is doing worse, so there are regional issues affecting that overall number, but it is quite staggering,” Leger said.

Leger’s internet-based survey was conducted using computer-assisted web interviewing technology from Feb. 15 to 19. It heard from 1,529 Canadians, 18 years of age or older, who have the right to vote in Canada and were randomly recruited from the firm’s online panel","<div class=""articlecontent"">

<p><strong><em>OTTAWA — A new online poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press suggests the Trudeau Liberals haven’t convinced Canadians the country is doing better under their stewardship.</em></strong></p>

The problem that it is very unlikely Sheer will pull a majority. And defeated by a minority Conservative, Trudeau will form a coalition with NDP to hang in power. We saw it B.C. were defeated Liberals refused to leave. Besides, such an entitled narcissic elite as Trudeau believe he was sent with a heavenly right to “save” his subjects (us) and the planet with his social engineering agenda.

I believe we will be stuck with at least another 2 years of this government. This will give enough time for Trudeau to finish his corruption implementation legacy in all states affairs: judicial, legislature and polotical. Afterward, it will be too late to undo, if Canada survives.

None of them will support a Con minority if a Liberal/NDP/Green gov’t can form!
Scheer has no chance with those polling numbers.
Scheer needs to find a reason for Canadians to choose him over them all. One ring to rule them all!

Being the junior partner in a coalition is usually a losing proposition. Either you get punished by your own base as a “sellout” (eg the Liberal Democrats in Britain), or if the government is unpopular you get dragged down along with the main party (eg Irish Labour), or if the government is popular, the larger party gets all the credit and you get squeezed out (eg the FDP in Germany, the Ontario NDP after propping up Peterson).

If I were the NDP, I’d be very leery of a coalition. Confidence and supply in exchange for some key concessions might make more sense.

While one poll, some interesting regionals and looking at others I think Trudeau should be very worried.

1. Doing horrible in the Prairies as one might expect but when you have an area with 2o% of the population that hates your guts that makes the math a bit more difficult

2. Ontario usually votes opposites and Doug Ford is not very popular yet despite this still tied or trailing in Ontario and if you cannot win Ontario tough to win nationally.

3. BC is all over the map, but hardly numbers to be optimistic about, but not as bad as elsewhere.

4. Lead in Quebec is dwindling and the whole plan was to gain seats in Quebec to offset losses elsewhere. More likely hold seats in Quebec, lose elsewhere if things don’t change.

5. Trailing in Atlantic Canada. That’s right, trailing the Tories in a region that they won by a whopping 40 points 4 years ago. Even if polls are wrong in Atlantic Canada, the Liberals in 2015 won by similar to margins to what Tories won Alberta by, this would be like the Tories tied or trailing in Alberta. Sure things were going to tighten up here and it was unlikely to be a repeat of 2015, but not this big a drop.

I’m sure Warren remembers, in the run up to the 1993 campaign, Campbell started polling competitively and Chretien made the famous Nervous Nellies comment.

Scheer hasn’t made the sale yet, just like Chretien hadn’t before the ’93 campaign started. It was the missteps by Campbell/Tory/Gregg during the campaign that turned the ’93 election into an extinction level even for the Progressive Conservatives.

Let’s see if the 2019 Liberals can match or exceed the campaign “mastery” of Campbell/Tory/Gregg ’93.

Based on the last few months, I’d say it is possible.

Bingo. Chretien was dismissed as “yesterday’s man” going into 1993, as I recall. Campbell was riding high just off the summer barbecue circuit.

Realistically, the Tories were going to lose that election – too much Mulroney baggage. But they could, and should, have salvaged enough seats (50-60) for a credible Official Opposition. It was the combination of an inept Tory campaign (“Is this a Prime Minister?”, “Elections are no time to talk about serious issues”), a masterful Liberal campaign (the Red Book, the War Room), and two convenient alternatives for alienated PC voters (Reform and the Bloc) that turned 1993 into an “extinction level event” (good choice of phrase).

The Liberals have had some horrible campaigns in their day as well – 1984 and 2006 spring to mind (I’m still shocked that Martin managed over 100 seats despite that trainwreck of a campaign) so it’s definitely not out of the realm of possibility.

If the Tories frame the ballot question as trust and leadership, they could win, but Scheer is still a blank slate to many Canadians. Having closed-door meetings with oil execs isn’t helping.

406,Warren Kinsella,"Joe and Justin: one’s a winner, one isn’t",2019-04-30 06:34:00,Warren,,"Joe and Justin?

There’s a connection. Stay with me, here.

In 2015 and 2016, I proudly volunteered for Hillary Clinton in two states, and at her Brooklyn headquarters. I’m going to be proudly volunteering for Joe Biden in 2019 and (if he’s the nominee) in 2020.

The reasons are threefold, and all of them – coincidentally – are quite relevant to Justin Trudeau’s political predicament in 2019.

One, we know why Joe Biden is running again. With Justin Trudeau, we don’t.

Joe commenced his campaign in a comparatively low-key way: he released a video on YouTube. He said he’s running to beat Donald Trump, because he’s the only candidate who can. Successive polls have shown that Americans know who Joe is, they like who he is, and they like him way more than Trump. He’s competitive with multiple demographics: African-Americans, older Democrats, Independents, the true working class.

Biden has what the advertising guys call a USP – a Unique Selling Proposition. That is, he can say things that his 19 Democratic competitors can’t. Experienced, likeable, scandal-free, Hell Of A Guy.

Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, no longer has a USP. In 2015, he was the self-proclaimed feminist. He isn’t any more. Gropegate – and his expulsion of Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes, coupled with his nauseating decision to keep a sexual harasser like Kent Hehr in his caucus – have obliterated his “feminist” credentials.

In 2015, he was the Indigenous reconciliation guy. No longer. He demeaned and defamed Wilson-Raybould, the most prominent Indigenous leader in our collective lifetimes. And, as the former Attorney-General pointed out in a widely-reported speech last week, Trudeau’s government “has fallen back into a pattern of trying to manage the problem.” And the problem is colonialism.

And Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau was the guy who promised to bring back ethics to government. He said he’d be open and transparent and not at all like the secretive and autocratic Stephen Harper. But the seamy, sordid LavScam scandal – which saw Trudeau and his minions pressuring Wilson-Raybould dozens of times to give help a corrupt Quebec company avoid a richly-deserved prosecution – has laid waste to the Liberal leader’s claim to the moral high ground.

What, now, is Justin Trudeau’s USP? Unlike Joe Biden, Trudeau has lost the narrative. He is unlikely to acquire a new one in the dwindling number of weeks that remain between now and the election.

Two: Joe Biden has what it takes to win, because he never forgot his roots. He never stopped boasting about his hardscrabble Scranton, Pa. youth. He grew up in a big Irish Catholic family in Scranton – in a crowded apartment – and the Bidens were forced to move to Delaware when Joe was ten, where his father secured a job as a used car salesman. He got into law school only because he got a scholarship. He participated in anti-segregation sit-ins. He struggled for everything he got.

Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, is the guy who likes to talk a lot about the middle class – but has never, ever experienced the middle class. Trudeau has never had to worry about paying the rent, or the next mortgage statement. He has never wondered where he’ll get the money to pay a hydro bill. He has never wanted for anything. His life has been one of mansions, private jets, and hanging out with celebrities.

Against Andrew Scheer – who, like Biden, grew up in a big immigrant Catholic family, and whose family didn’t have any wealth – Trudeau will likely appear privileged and out-of-touch. Scheer worked as a waiter and a salesman. Trudeau, meanwhile, wears a $15,000 IWC Portuguese Regulateur watch and drives a Mercedes-Benz 300SL. (Which, apparently, can sell for as much as $5 million.)

Third and final reason: traditional assumptions about politics are long gone.

You’re not guaranteed a second term anymore. You’re not going to win simply because your candidate is more charismatic and more photogenic. You don’t win if you have the slickest social media.

If the 2016 presidential race taught me anything else, it’s this: everything in politics is different, now. Hillary had the best-organized, best-funded, best-staffed, best-led campaign I have ever been part of. But it didn’t matter: we still lost.

Politics has been upended, everywhere. So, traditional assumptions about campaigns – whether Joe is too old, too politically-incorrect, too centrist – are kind of irrelevant, now. Trump showed that.

Running the 2016 campaign again will get Democrats another 2016 result, and Biden knows it. He will therefore be at the centre of a decidedly un-Hillary-like campaign.

Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, is still fighting the last war. He’s using against Andrew Scheer the same stuff he used against Stephen Harper: that Scheer is mean and a neo-Nazi and has a hidden agenda. While he’s the middle class, feminist, ethical paragon. Blah blah blah.

As the Canadian and American national races edge ever-closer, we all know who Joe Biden is, and what he wants to do.

Trump won over Clinton because Americans were mad at the state of their government and their political institutions. They still are. Anyone positioning themselves as the grand defender of the status quo is bound to lose, in that situation.

Hypersensitive much? I’m merely making the logical observation that if you say “Americans were mad at . . .”, that implies that either all Americans felt that way, or a strong plurality felt that way. But all Americans did not vote for Trump, nor did a majority or plurality of the electorate do so.

I’m not complaining about the rules of the election. I’m just pointing out that you can’t conclude by the electoral math that all, a plurality or a majority of Americans felt the way that you claim they felt. Under your logic, one could just as easily claim that “Americans were taken with Hillary’s compelling message” in 2016. Which is obviously BS.

I think I read somewhere that Biden was, at one point, the poorest member of the Senate. (Admittedly a pretty rareified group of mostly multi-millionaires.) His only real asset was a house in Wilmington.

He became famous for commuting back and forth between his home and DC by Amtrak every day. Why? His first wife was killed in a car crash just months after his first election to the Senate and he wanted to be home with his two sons every night (both of whom were also badly injured in the crash and one of whom – Beau – has since sadly passed away from brain cancer).

This guy has a compelling story. If only the Democratic primary electorate will let him tell it to the American people. Sadly, I have a feeling he’s not “woke” enough (and too old, too white, and too male) for the rank and file who now see the likes of AOC as the future. They will pull a McGovern and nominate someone ideologically pure but who alienates working and middle-class whites (just like McGovern did), and who will go down to spectacular defeat against Trump.

I am sure Biden is a good guy to have a coffee with, but not to run the country.

The world will be set straight when Trudeau is defeated in 2019 and Trump is re-elected in 2020.

(Oh, and for those conservative types who continually rail about how the CBC is part of a vast pro-Liberal conspiracy? Read this story before you pop off on social media, next time.)

All of the story is here. Key highlights here:

A confidential document sent to the Liberal Party of Canada in 2016, and obtained by CBC/Radio-Canada, reveals how top officials at the embattled engineering firm SNC-Lavalin were named in a scheme to illegally influence Canadian elections.

The list of names, compiled in 2016 by federal investigators probing political party donations and leaked to CBC’s The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada’s Enquête, raises new questions about an agreement by the Commissioner of Canada Elections not to prosecute the company.

The federal Liberals were sent the list in a letter marked “confidential” from the Commissioner of Canada Elections — the investigative branch of Elections Canada — on Aug. 5, 2016. But for nearly three years, neither Elections Canada nor the Liberal Party shared that information publicly.

The investigation reveals that over a period of more than five years between 2004 and 2009, 18 former SNC-Lavalin employees, directors and some spouses contributed nearly $110,000 to the federal Liberals, including to four party leadership campaigns and four riding associations in Quebec.

According to the letter, the investigation found that SNC-Lavalin reimbursed all of those individual donations — a practice forbidden under the Canada Elections Act.

And, look! Another DPA-style deal that favoured these sleazebags:

The illicit SNC-Lavalin operation went undetected for nearly a decade. Despite the evidence collected by investigators, the Commissioner of Canada Elections decided not to bring charges against the company, which is headquartered in Montreal but operates around the world.

“We know that the decisions to take part in this scheme took place at the very highest levels of SNC-Lavalin,” said Ayotte. “‘[It] seems to all suggest to me that there should have been a prosecution.”

SNC-Lavalin avoided charges by signing what is known as a “compliance agreement” in 2016 with the Commissioner of Canada Elections after promising not to break the law in the future.

And:

The Liberal Party repeatedly refused to provide the names of those involved when asked by reporters for CBC/Radio-Canada…in his letter to the Liberal Party, the Commissioner of Canada Elections stated that all those donations listed were made, indirectly, by SNC-Lavalin itself. The commissioner stated that the SNC-Lavalin contributions were “ineligible” — meaning they violated the law — and had to be paid back.

The Liberal Party’s revenue chair, Stephen Bronfman, did not return voice messages left by CBC/Radio-Canada. Party spokesman Braeden Caley wrote in an email that “The Liberal Party of Canada fully complies with the Canada Elections Act and all Elections Canada regulations for fundraising and donations and expects all people donating to our party to do so lawfully and to follow the same rules.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

That’s what’s different. It’s not realistic to suggest media that is solely reliant on advertising revenue to exist can be completely unbiased. Media is always biased – people have bias, it’s almost impossible not to have bias when your entire conception of the world around you is developed completely from your perspective – it’s why folks call each other “out of touch”, because from my eyes the world is a different place than from yours –

Joseph Taylor says:

Absolutely everyone is biased. The problem is the media is almost entirely composed of people who share the same bias. It’s a mono culture of secular, university educated, big city urbanites whose views and values align very closely with the liberal party.

Like most of Media CBC, CTV, Global, The (red) Star, their left-leaning agenda is subtle: Instead of totally ignore the new; they report it, only to bury it in haste.

On CBC website, this SNC Report has already been shadowed by AirBnb on the front-line. By tomorrow, it will be nowhere to be found. Like all other Trudeau`s numerous issues.

CBC has been mostly reporting the SNC as an “affair” or “controversy”, not a scandal, by the way…

In contrast, the Media have been talking 24/7 for 2 years about the “scandal-of-the century”: $90K Harper gave Duffy to pay for his expenses (which ended by being not illegal, after all): “What did he know”, “Explosive e-mails”, “Nigel this and Nigel that”. etc.

Now try to imagine Harper -instead of Trudeau- been confronted by a resident wile showing for photo-up-flood: We would have this clip running non-stop for a couple of weeks on CBC, with related investigation about the miserable residents delayed by the evil Harper, their crying children, their sunken houses, the RCMP-police-state agents garbing honest citizen questioning their tyrant, etc.

I must be watching and reading different media than you. I read the local newspaper daily; review online websites for CBC News and CTV News multiple times each day, and watch both networks’ evening newscasts each night. I have not seen or heard anything about the Harper/Duffy matter in quite some time.

With respect to CBC specifically, I’d say they passed the poor-reporting torch to CTV a while back. CBC television news of late tends to be fairly objective, and delivered with a straight face. By contrast, CTV news reporters (and anchors) seem to be competing for Best Actor/Actress nominations – each trying to outdo the other with their quizzical or scornful looks, and emotional tone in their voices.

Charles says:

Steve: Of course you do not hear anymore about the Duffy affair because it died the day Trudeau got elected. And when Duffy was cleared by the courts, nobody almost heard about it, since his case became irrelevant after Harper defeat.

I do not care much if CTV or other news networks leans left or right, as long as they are not sucking my taxes like CBC, only to be Liberal cheerleaders. Have you noticed recently the increase in the Doom and Gloom climate studies and the “dirty” Albertan oil since Kenny got elected?

I’m always amazed that some pollsters would put their reputations on the line for the sake of their political agendas.
We already know Graves’ leanings, so blatant that even CBC dumped him. Abacus is a joke, with boss Bruce Anderson’s daughter in the PMO as Trudeau’s Comms. Dir. Nanos & Pollara are known Lib supporters as is Mainstreet. Most also fk with the results to suit the client. None Have Credibility, nor does Grenier’s CBC Poll Tracker which continues to use these biased pollsters that skew his results. It’s also surprising that the whole gang of them, think they can get away with this stupid shite in this day and age.

Therefore, I suspect the Libs may have permanently lost (or lost for quite some time) their left-leaning support. Probably their best strategy is to focus solely on grabbing centre-right votes from the CPC. Unfortunately for them, they’ve sort of burned the fiscal / economic banner over this past term through that virtue-signalling strategy. Gotta love kharma.

I can never explain why Libs do anything, but the firms named all have the connections to them as I stated. Their results always seem to favor Trudeau & LPC, even when others don’t. The agenda at the CBC has been such that there can be no other option but to think they are happy to have the poll tracker be skewed Lib & Left.
Others using the likes of Pollara, Mainstreet, Ekos, Abacus, Nanos etc. must assume their work outside of politics is legit, but no one familiar with their ownership & principle staff can assume that of their polling magic tricks.

Conventional wisdom was that Jasmeet Singh had to get the Party over 25% for the CPC to have a chance. But you are correct. It now appears the Greens are strong enough the NDP + Green > 30%. The Bloc also appears to be gaining with this wholesale exodus from the Liberal Party. By election time, the Liberals may not have the most seats in any Region in Canada.

Imagine if the NDP. let go of the past and decided to elect more progressive MPs. Singh could reach an agreement with May to not challenge each other in some ridings. The Greens not run in Halifax and the NDP not run in Fredericton etc. They would take a lot of seats away from the Liberals.

The last thing the NDP should do is be more progressive. They need to rediscover their roots – fiscally sensible working man politics that instead of being targeted at the factory floor it’s targeted at the office and service sector. Think Biden and you aren’t far off.

Trying to be “Liberal lite” will just elect more Liberals.

You underestimate how much of the NDP’s potential support base has been put off and even enraged by the centrist direction over the past several years.

It’s no accident that the ONDP got a much improved result from taking a more clearly progressive path and nearly took that to a win before Ford did a better job of channelling people’s anger against the Liberal government.

Question for you warren:
If the cpc wins a minority- which essentially every poll for the past two months would suggest – is JT finished as leader?

Supplementary to that.: if your answer is “yes” to the above and if that is the almost certain outcome say around mid-august (pre-Norman trial) what reason would the LPC have to keep him as leader?

Gord,

Political parties are seriously and purposely dysfunctional operations — they demand absolute loyalty and obedience to the leader — when the opposite is never true. As soon as it becomes politically expedient to throw someone under the bus, the leader does so in a New York minute.

Trudeau is perfectly safe in his job, come hell or high water. It’s not at all in the nature of the beast to take him on, much less attempt to remove him as PM. I have a better chance of leading a national political party than MPs have of conditioning themselves to a non-theoretical leadership challenge.

Vancouverois says: 

May 5, 2019 at 4:34 pm

But only as long as the leader is leading them to victory, surely?

Admittedly the current LPC is a special situation, because without Trudeau they basically have nothing. That will remain true even if he drops down to a minority, or even if the minority goes to the Conservatives, I think. It’s only if Scheer gets a majority that JT may have to consider resignation, IMHO.

But it is still way too early to be making predictions anyway…

Vancouverois,

Bottoms drop out when they drop out and that happens even before campaigns begin. Let’s go back when I was still CPC and writing that if Harper was as good a tactician as he himself believed, after the two minority mandate lesson, he would hold the road at centre-right after getting the majority. But in fact, he foolishly chose to do the opposite and red-meat everything from census to scientists. That finished Harper off even before the writ dropped. Too far right, too fast, for the voting public. I thought Harper was in his heart of hearts a true incrementalist but also a guy politically sensitive enough to smell the winds and correctly take in those vibes. I was dead wrong.

B) Cannibis was delivered, Medical assistance in dying was delivered, training holidays was delivered, the economy is okay. There must be some other wedge to block a Tory majority…ah yes, a sweetheart pipeline to The heart of every Canadian; a small business stimulus package, implement better immigration management…. lots of ideas

Ronald O’Dowd, with all due respect, the idea that Trudeau has spent all his political capital is misleading (but a nice rhetorical flourish)…although another leader could help out this fall, Trudeau needs to declare a reset with Canadians, a mea culpa that he and the civil service (the operators) could not deliver on his lofty “we’re-in-third-place-according-to-very-reliable-polling-agencies” style promises in ‘15, and reframe the election around principles with painful consequences for failing to deliver. Now that we can promise with better information. This next Liberal government will be “toughest on itself”; The specific carefully formulate promises will have fail safe consequences such as a) fining and garnishing wages of MPs and civil servants who missed targets even with extenuating circumstances, b) automatically triggering resignations upon missing baseline targets, c) public investigations into why a given policy was not fulfilled and remedies, d) bonuses delivered to constituents for good performance by an MP…and some other stuff I cannot share here. I mean this promise fail safe alone would be an excellent campaign promise…to them break (so very meta).

*Scheer would prefer to make as few commitments as possible with this false lead 5months out. He hasn’t taken a view on SNC Lavalin for example. Will he repeal Cannibis, MAID (medical assistance in dying? He’s an inside baseball guy who is also an intellectual novice. If he wins on a “Trudeau sucked” ticket, Scheer will have a Cart Blanche to basically carry on mediocre Harper-style government and make Indigenous leaderhip (very different from indigenous people) rather unhappy indeed. It takes intellectual maturity to realize that in advance of whistle blowing: Jody Wilson Rayboald!

KMMF,

With respect right back at you, allow me to work this from the bottom up: first and foremost, are any of the parties supposed to be there to work on behalf of First Nations leadership? In my book, the interests of First Nations people must always come first.

Next, I don’t necessarily disagree with your characterization of Scheer and the CPC. They are quite deliberate opportunists like any official opposition.

Finally, as to the reset itself: hope it won’t end like Hillary’s with Russia. Also would expect every bit of it to be legally permissible. But most important of all, how can we as Liberals take Trudeau seriously if he still foolishly refuses to get that reset going where it counts the most: in his OWN PMO?

I’ve been literally alternating between begging and screaming since India to clean out the damned place and still nothing. Remember, Butts left on his own. Remind this Prime Minister that yours truly and quite a few others won’t remotely take Trudeau seriously until the PMO SNC-L-Norman gang are gone, period.

Justin is lucky that we can’t fire him as leader — because right now, by his own actions or lack thereof, he’s put me and a lot of other Canadians in that sort of mood. A full PMO cleanup is MY litmus test. And to get my vote: reinstate JWR and JP as Liberal candidates. Don’t expect poll changes until that’s done, cause they ain’t happening without it. Think I’m full of shit? Maybe. But I’m taking my view to the bank.

Karl-Milton Marx-Friedman says:

Yes, I’d say the PMO should see more changes post-election. Pre-election? It would take more than a 24 hour day can muster x several months of recruiting. Maybe there are good people in the PMO that could shine with a 25% dismissal rate? A bit of a gamble and those leavers would need cushy jobs otherwise they might leak; more harm then good to fire PMO staffers now?





Ronald O'Dowd says:

KMMF,

Let’s bring it down to a personal level. I don’t know about you but when I’m REALLY pissed off at someone, the last thing that works with me is the power of inertia. That only makes things much worse. It crystallizes already held feelings and poisons the present and future relationship.

Transpose the situation as regards this PM: He’s seen as incessently digging the hole deeper and bigger rather than digging himself and his government out. That’s what they don’t get. Who is master of this government? PM or caucus? Right now, THEY are calling all political shots and if decisions aren’t reversed with at least the Chief of Staff and Comms. Director going, this government is done.

Martin was a much stronger PM and yet got done in by previous political decisions. This government will almost inevitably go down because of its own decisions. No runway until October can change that once public opinion has hardened into stone. And we are already almost there. Allowing caucus to hold sway re: JWR and JP is the most serious and grave error made since 2015.





Ronald O'Dowd says: 

May 5, 2019 at 6:48 pm

Now, as to Butts: it will come as no surprise to you that I had the same bone to pick with him as with the other two.

Butts fiercely believes he did nothing wrong — and that’s a fair point. But the reason why I have come to admire his conduct is because he chose to do his job up to the highest possible standard namely, protect his prime minister and take the political bullet for him. Butts did his job 110%, his colleagues in the PMO Trinity, not so much.

Ford has introduced more uncertainty by reducing government services etc in order to lightly chip away at fiscal debt interest payments which are massive and benefit bond holders ie the 35% of Canadians who invest in risk free govt bonds for their own private wealth (another reason the wealthy might support deficit spending governments)

Ford’s changes (or his team’s changes based on the TStar expose) hurt pension managed public sector jobs in education and healthcare principally. It’s embarrassing but once a paradigm is stabilized, these civil servants (understandably) wish to avoid the uncertainty that the rest of us strive in. Understandable because Canada’s private sector is really small and largely a branch plant for US conglomerates.

Since, the public sector and left leaners cannot retaliate with a direct democracy arsenal as of yet, this federal election is a chance to buttress Ford (so goes the narrative). AND the CBC has played up this story because it is easy to explain a map of Canada with blue and red and orange provinces even though it has very limited predictive power (it’s still a variable in the calculus of course)

Trump is supposed to help Trudeau massively, but events my dear, events! Perhaps there is still time to 1 way collude:-) for a few percentage points. So desperate.

In reality, voter preferences are complex and inputs must be weighted against the fresh variables (-SNC -India, +Cannibis +MAID -/+Trudeau himself) that comprise the cognitive load of each swing voter (the deciders in October).

Ultimately partly imagined partly real, this Fed/Prov foil narrative is used by parties: The LPC door knock against Ford to galvanize leaners and declareds to show up, just as the reverse can be galvanizing at the campaign level in Alberta. If the Blue Jays are in the World Series, you could argue build a narrative about Canada is winning…

(secretly) It is better for Ford et al to have a Liberal federal government so that blame for underperformance can be channeled there for the election 2022. IF Ford believes Trudeau helps him, he might do the Machiavellian things he has a mandate to implement.

The Greens are the ultimate “none of the above” / parking vote. Outside of a few pockets in Atlantic Canada and Vancouver Island, they’re pretty much non-existent on the ground. I highly doubt they’ll crack double digits when the chips are down.

That said, my guess is a lot of that upswing in Green support is disaffected Liberals. A lot of them will drift back (plus some people may not want to tell a pollster they’re supporting them), but if a good number of them stay, or decide to go for the Dippers, that’s a big problem for JT.

I’ll close with this – at the drop of the writ in 2011, the CPC was polling in the high 30s/low 40s, the Liberals around 25%, and the NDP in the high teens.
Make of that what you will.

That comment should be aimed not at Donald Trump and his supporters, but at the Democrats (and CNN, and the New York Times, and the Washington Post, et al..), If *they* would just grow up, admit that there is NOTHING THERE and move on, Trump would have nothing to tweet about. Instead, they keep whining about information being kept from them, tax returns, impeachment and other nonsense when they should be getting back to reaching out to the American public and asking for their support.

398,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: Trudeau, Liberals, and the inevitable sinking ship metaphor",2019-05-04 17:25:00,Warren,,"Cue the soundtrack from Titanic.

Once upon a time, Andrew Leslie was a star Liberal Party candidate. A decorated former commander of the Canadian Armed Forces, Leslie was hailed by Justin Trudeau as proof the Liberals were pro-military.

Way back in 2013, when Trudeau named the 35-year veteran to an advisory committee on international affairs, he said as much.

Having Leslie around showed “a tremendous amount of support and pride for our Canadian Forces,” Trudeau said.

Well, that was then, this is now.

Lots of people thought Leslie was a shoo-in for a senior cabinet post. But it was not to be. Trudeau made Leslie whip, which is the Parliamentary equivalent of a hall monitor. But he never bestowed on Leslie a senior cabinet minister post.

Now we may have learned why.

On Friday, CTV revealed that Leslie is readying to testify in the sensational trial of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman — and against the Trudeau government, no less.

The shocking revelation is bad, bad news for the Trudeau regime. But it’s good news for those of us who still believe in the Rule of Law. And it certainly suggests that Andrew Leslie deserved to be a minister.

Adam Vaughan probably felt he deserved one, too. The former Toronto city councillor was recruited by Trudeau with great fanfare back in 2014. It was a big deal.

Trudeau’s factotums even leaked news of Vaughan’s candidacy to the Toronto Star, which dutifully ran it on the front page like it was a moon landing.

“Adam Vaughan’s decision to seek the Liberal nomination in the Trinity-Spadina by-election was sealed with a handshake over lunch at Le Select Bistro!” theStar gushed. “There’s no question (recruiting Vaughan) is a coup for Justin Trudeau!”

After reading that, Adam Vaughan could be forgiven for thinking he was destined for ministerial limousines and a “P.C.” appended to his surname. But, like Andrew Leslie, it was not to be.

The closest Vaughan ever got to the big leagues was “Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs.” Which, as we say back home in Calgary, is a title that is all hat but no cattle. It’s the square root of diddly.

Bill Blair too. Recruited with fanfare by Trudeau and his fart-catchers, then dropped into the anonymity of the Liberal backbench for years.

A former Toronto Police chief, Blair achieved distinction for overseeing the largest abridgement of civil rights in modern Canadian history, during the G20 summit in 2010. Trudeau — whose family had hands-on experience with abridging civil rights, too — was unperturbed.

“Mr. Blair was a first responder for over 39 years and having him by my side…emphasizes how seriously we take the responsibility of service in this party,” Trudeau said.

And, then, poof! Bill Blair disappeared.

Along with Leslie, other Liberal MPs are disappearing, too. At the moment, a total of 18 ridings won’t have an incumbent Liberal on the ballot in the Fall.

Scott Brison, whose sudden resignation gave Trudeau the pretext to jettison Jody Wilson-Raybould, has decided to spend more time with his family back in Nova Scotia. Same with Bill Casey, Mark Eyking, Colin Fraser and Rodger Cuzner — all Nova Scotia Liberal MPs, all choosing discretion over valour.

Thunder Bay Liberal MP Don Rusnak. Newmarket’s Kyle Peterson. Quebec’s invisible Grit MP, Nicola Di Iorio. The fearless and principled Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who was rightly disgusted by Trudeau’s grubby efforts to secure a sweetheart deal for SNC-Lavalin in court. She’s leaving, too.

Oh, and Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott — the two ministers who resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet because they could no longer abide the corruption and cronyism. And who were later kicked out of caucus by Trudeau for telling the truth to power. Liberals no more.

Trudeau’s spinners, naturally, are all insisting the departures are natural and normal.

The rest of us, meanwhile, can be forgiven for wondering whether the S.S. Trudeau is cruising towards the proverbial iceberg.

Indeed… If you take a casual look at the bios of some Liberal back benchers, it is remarkable how many weighty, powerful resumes were left left out of cabinet. You could make an argument that it was one of the most qualified back benches ever. Serious people who any normal PM would easily have wanted in cabinet. Then contrast with at least 7-8 Cabinet members who couldn’t be relied upon to organize the parking lot at the Letterkenny rummage sale.

Justin Trudeau actually undermines womens’ success when he appoints under qualified, political rookies, like Maryam Monsef, Patty Hadju and Diane Leboutillier to ministerial positions over people more qualified people like Andrew Leslie. Everybody knows there are people in his cabinet who are only there because of what’s between their legs when he mandates a gender balanced cabinet. Even if you are a star female candidate how can it not undermine your confidence if in the back of your mind you wonder whether you actually earned it or whether you are just filling out a diversity quota?

“This is/was not the purchase of three used nuclear submarines from Britain that are money holes. ”

Diesel-electric submarines. We *should* have bought the nuclear 688 class boat to allow us to operate under the arctic ice, but didn’t.

Fred,

In an ideal world, Yes. But just look at the latest Russian sub that the Americans can’t find at least one third of the time. A middle power like Canada shouldn’t be paying that kind of big bucks when technology moves so fast and renders even nuclear duds almost obsolete within years. Ditto for the F35.

Fred from BC says: 

May 6, 2019 at 7:06 pm

You mean the Lada? It’s a paper tiger, sorry…they can’t even get their AIP technology to work (at least not until 2021), so they released the first of the class as a diesel-electric …which is quiet, sure, but the Germans and the Dutch already have really stealthy non-nuclear boats of their own with superior technology (let’s face it: the Russians just can’t afford to play this game anymore no matter how hard they try to fake it).

And even if they finally do get the things to work properly, so what? None of the submarines mentioned above are blue-water capable, meaning they could only be used for coastal defense. Nuclear boats rule, and the Americans have the best; the Europeans are building these high-tech diesel-electric and AIP submarines only because they either can’t afford nuclear or don’t need the range or speed nuke boats provide.

Also, don’t believe the hype about not being able to find and track the Lada; the Americans not only have the best submarines…they have the best *technology* to go with them. (the US military will sometimes ‘leak’ concerns about new foreign warships/aircraft/tanks/missles etc only to get the public worried enough to support budget and/or procurement increases).

The reason Canada should have bought the used LA class boat was strictly for its under-ice capabilities (the 688i). If arctic sovereignty is an issue, that’s the *only* way to enforce it; if other nations can traverse our waters undetected and unchallenged enough times they can actually build a ‘right of navigation’ case against us and we can lose our claim to the waters (and all the riches therein).

As for the F-35, Canada is a partner in the development and construction of it, so it’s kinda stupid to be buying used (and older) equipment from other nations in my opinion. Either buy the F-35 *that we are already heavily invested in*, or pull out of the partnership and go a different direction.

396,Warren Kinsella,Pray for Justin’s Jeremy,2019-05-07 06:09:00,Warren,,"Pause, for a moment, to say a prayer for Jeremy Broadhurst.

A few days ago, Broadhurst was named the campaign director for the Liberal Party of Canada’s 2019 re-election effort. He was not the first choice.

The first choice was Katie Telford, Trudeau’s Chief of Staff. The 2019 plan was for Telford to reprise her 2015 campaign role, with principal secretary Gerald Butts riding on the campaign plane with Justin Trudeau. Telford would again oversee the campaign back in Ottawa, and Butts would be on the road, hectoring journalists on Twitter and explaining big words to the Liberal leader.

Then, LavScam hit. Obstructions of justice, breaches of trust, plummeting popularity, resignations aplenty.

It remains an enduring mystery why Gerald Butts was the one to resign, and Katie Telford wasn’t. By Jody Wilson-Raybould’s own admission, Butts was the prime ministerial factotum she spoke to the most. He was the one she liked and trusted. His only sin, according to the incomplete evidentiary record, was to acknowledge the reality of what was going on.

There was no solution to the SNC-Lavalin matter “that does not involve some interference,” Butts blandly informed Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff at a now-infamous December 18, 2018 meeting. It was Telford, however, who was far more direct.

“We don’t want to debate legalities anymore,” Telford said to the Attorney-General’s shocked Chief. “Legalities,” here, refers to “the law,” “the Rule of Law” and “the criminal justice system.” In effect, the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of Canada said that the law didn’t matter, and – allegedly – that it could be bent, if not broken.

How Katie Telford could survive that, and Gerald Butts could not, is mystifying. We will need to wait for Prime Minister Andrew Scheer to relieve Jody Wilson-Raybould of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality, one supposes.

But we digress. Jeremy Broadhurst, as is his wont, has stepped up to the proverbial plate. Or, in this case, the chopping block. His dedication to the Liberal cause is so complete, one is moved to wonder if he has the party logo tattooed on one of his body parts.

He’s a lifer, Broadhurst is. Attended one of the better law schools in Canada (U of T), was an associate at one of the better law firms (Davies Ward Phillips), and then…he gave it all up and moved to Ottawa.

He has served every permanent and interim Liberal Party leader for the past decade-and-a-half, which is testament to his fealty, if not necessarily his sanity. Mostly, he’s laboured on the policy side of the campaign divide, but he did act as Telford’s second-in-command during the successful 2015 election effort.

His most-senior post – before he was invited to breathe the rarefied air of PMO in 2015 – was to act as the lead guy on “Parliamentary strategies and tactics” after Michael Ignatieff fired everyone he knew, and hired a bunch of people he didn’t. Ignatieff – and, by extension, Broadhurst and others – then giddily piloted the Liberal Party of Canada into the ditch in 2011, leading to its worst electoral result in its history. Third place, 34 MPs. Ignatieff spoke glowingly of Broadhurst in the book he wrote afterwards, the one that confirmed that he was, in fact, just visiting.

Prior to Ignatieff’s OLO bloodletting, this writer met Jeremy Broadhurst. He was an enigma to me. Unlike every other Liberal I knew, Broadhurst had declined to choose sides in the leadership wars that had beset the Liberal Party for most of two decades. Personally, I had always subscribed to Graham Greene’s view: in order to remain human, one must choose sides. Broadhurst didn’t.

At meetings in the panelled confines of room 409-S, Broadhurst would therefore sit alongside all the senior MPs and senior staffers and this is what he would say:
Nothing.

After quite a bit of this, I came to understand how Jeremy Broadhurst had survived so long. He didn’t take anything that resembled a clear position. He didn’t take clear positions at all, really.

Is that the sort of fellow you want running your election campaign, when just one recent poll pegs you at 13 points behind the aforementioned Andrew Scheer? Someone who doesn’t have a theory of the case to prosecute?

The winningest Liberal campaign managers were John Rae and Keith Davey, for Jean Chretien and Pierre Trudeau, respectively. Both men ran the same sort of campaigns: let Chretien be Chretien, let Trudeau be Trudeau. Ruthlessly hammer your opponent, and always talk about your issues – not the other guy’s issues.

Jeremey Broadhurst can’t do any of that. In particular, he can’t let Justin be Justin – because, as Maclean’s famously put it on a recent cover, Justin is “The Imposter.” He has no core beliefs or persona. He’s truly what he always was: an actor.

Say a prayer, then, for Jeremy Broadhurst. His devotion to the Liberal Party cannot be questioned.

Maybe Butts resigned because he just got tired of constantly having to ” explain big words to the Liberal leader”. I’m speculating that Butts thought, at the outset, that JT would learn from his mistakes and grow into his role as PM. However, JT in 2019 is just as clueless as he was in 2015, so it wouldn’t surprise me if Butts just decided to throw in the towel.

Yeah well, we all choose a path in life in the hope of a reward at the end of the path.
His sounds like one where he plays martyr for the lost causes, but in reality just looks around for the most popular position of the moment and tries to get at the front of the parade. That fits the MO of just sitting at the table and not saying anything.
As to Telford, well I suppose there is evidence to suggest she should be outside the PMO, but that doesn’t automatically excuse Butt’s role in the shenanigans does it?
There are more than a few in and outside the PMO that where cognizant of what was going on that are able to remain behind the secrecy of cabinet confidentiality.
It should also be remembered that this “solution ” didn’t get formulated over a weekend, so anyone in cabinet could be party to the plan
Call it one of those facts that shall not be spoken outside of cabinet …. those that do get kicked out of caucus.

Firstly, little Justin did not have the guts to terminate another woman after JWR and JP. So Telford was saved by her gender. And he also knew Butts would only ever be just a phone call away, still reachable, still holding influence by voice to fill the PM’s voracious curiosity about life and politics. So dumping Butts was the default option and never doubted.

Telford will still be calling the shots. Once parliament rises, she will move to LPC HQ and run the campaign. They just did not want her to become the target of CPC election ads. She will still be coordinating the ground game, advertising, etc. etc. Butts will also be in the war room, unofficially, of course, and if the Liberals lose, they will all blame Jeremy B., and move on to lucrative consulting careers and television punditry … until the next Liberal Messiah arrives.

<p>5. There is an anti-incumbent <em>zeitgeist</em> in Western democracy, now, and the Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats are all seen as incumbents. The Greens aren’t. More change is coming, methinks.</p>

If the NDP won, it would’ve been heralded as a miracle and a comeback for the party federally.

Right now it feels like 1993 all over again for the NDP, and last night was more evidence of that.

So the narrative that this Riding is the NDPs to lose is a bit far fetched.

I think this is a much worse result for the NDP than for the Justin Party. It was theirs to lose, and they did.

I suspect at least a couple other NDP seats on southern Vancouver Island are in play for the Greens – Cowichan-Malahat-Langford (which overlaps with the provincial Cowichan Valley constituency held by the Greens) and Victoria (there is no incumbent, it includes Andrew Weaver’s provincial seat, and the Greens came close in the 2012 by-election and in 2015).

A related factor is that J. Singh has so far gone over like a lead balloon.

The other thing I notice is that the Greens are truly a classic protest party these days. I find if you ask a lot of people who have voted Green about the Green Party’s actual policy platform, I get a blank stare and silence.

Also kind of funny that this is almost exactly where another protest party — the Reform Party — stood in Parliament at the dawn of the 1990s, i.e., with a couple of MPs. And especially in BC, the (considerable number of) people who voted Reform in the 1993 federal election were an ideologically odd assortment of disaffected Conservatives and Dippers. You’ll recall that the early 1990s were very unkind to the federal NDP.

Walter, you skipped to the third question.

The first question should be who decided to press charges. The NP article states that part of the criminal offense involves deriving a personal benefit. Apparently the Crown was having difficulty in establishing that. Shouldn’t the concept of determining the personal benefit element have been identified prior to pressing charges? In other words, why were charges laid in the first place?

The second question is why were the charges dropped? The why may provide the answer to your question, which is who made the decision.

One would need an extra tall pair of Wellington boots to wade through the barnyard waste that forms the backstory on this case.

I can only hope that Vice Admiral Norman seeks full reimbursement of his legal fees, and a few dollars for defamation and improper persecution (not a spelling error). A civil suit filed in mid to late September sounds about right.

During the 10 years of Harper, I dot recall gays got imprisoned or women been forced to stop abortion – who remained funded by taxpayers.

389,Warren Kinsella,My latest: the Trudeau regime gets caught – again,2019-05-08 11:54:00,Warren,,"Don’t get caught.

If your political party has been caught obstructing justice — as the political party led by Justin Trudeau assuredly was, in the SNC-Lavalin scandal — what’s the one thing you need to avoid, at all costs?

Getting caught obstructing justice again, of course.

And that’s what the Trudeau regime’s prosecution of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman would have exposed: Senior Trudeau government officials, implicated in a scheme to use the criminal justice system to punish an alleged whistleblower. In this case, the second-highest-ranking officer in the Canadian Forces.

The “crime” Norman was accused of wasn’t a crime at all. In the early days of the Trudeau government, some senior cabinet ministers and political staffers tried to interfere in a multimillion-dollar contract that had been awarded for a much-needed supply ship for the Royal Canadian Navy. As in the LavScam scandal, senior Grits wanted the contract to go to a firm that had supported them politically.

A whistleblower blew the whistle — just like in LavScam — and leaked the story to the media. The Trudeau government was livid. They went after the alleged whistleblower — just like they went after Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott for blowing the whistle on corruption.

Norman — like Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — deserved the Order of Canada, not persecution, for refusing to break the rules to help out a Trudeau government political crony. They didn’t deserve to have their lives and reputations destroyed.

Justin Trudeau — who, angelic visage notwithstanding, is a vengeful and petty little man — went after Norman, viciously. The vice-admiral was criminally charged with breach of trust. Norman vehemently denied he was the source of the leak, and hired one of the best lawyers in Canada, Marie Heinen (who, full disclosure, this writer’s firm has worked with in the past).

That’s when things got interesting.

Back in February, during the pre-trial legal skirmishing over documents Trudeau’s staff were covering up, a shocking revelation came to light. Norman’s lawyers alleged that prosecutors had been talking trial strategy with Trudeau’s personal bureaucrats in the Privy Council Office (PCO).

That’s a big no-no. As in the LavScam case, criminal prosecutions must always be independent of politics. If the likes of Trudeau can use the criminal justice system to reward friends (like SNC-Lavalin) and punish enemies (like Norman), we will have fully become a totalitarian regime. We are no longer a true democracy.

“By all appearances,” one of Norman’s lawyers told the trial judge in February, “this is a more direct influencing of the prosecution … the Prime Minister’s Office, via its right arm the PCO, is dealing directly with the PPSC (Public Prosecution Service of Canada). And the prosecution service is allowing this to happen.”

The presiding judge was not impressed. “So much for the independence of the PPSC,” declared Judge Heather Perkins-McVey.

And, it was at that moment that many of us knew that Norman’s trial — scheduled for August, just weeks before the election writs were going to drop — was never going to happen. In open court, a senior judge had taken note of political interference by Trudeau’s PMO and PCO. And, at that point, for Trudeau and his winged monkeys, it became crucial that the trial never be allowed to happen.

And, now it won’t. As Christie Blatchford revealed in a Postmedia scoop, the Trudeau government abruptly decided to suddenly drop the prosecution of Norman. On Wednesday, they stayed the charges.

After LavScam — and after the attempted show trial of Norman — we can now be left with only one conclusion:
This is the most corrupt federal government in Canada’s history.

<p>The presiding judge was not impressed. “So much for the independence of the PPSC,” declared Judge Heather Perkins-McVey.</p>
<p>And, it was at that moment that many of us knew that Norman’s trial — scheduled for August, just weeks before the election writs were going to drop — was never going to happen. In open court, a senior judge had taken note of political interference by Trudeau’s PMO and PCO. And, at that point, for Trudeau and his winged monkeys, it became crucial that the trial never be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>And, now it won’t. As Christie Blatchford revealed in a Postmedia scoop, the Trudeau government abruptly decided to suddenly drop the prosecution of Norman. On Wednesday, they stayed the charges.</p>
<p>After LavScam — and after the attempted show trial of Norman — we can now be left with only one conclusion:</p>
<p>This is the most corrupt federal government in Canada’s history.</p>
<p>And they must — <em>must</em> — be defeated.</p>

And harper managed to get the then new PPS to come up with 31 fake charges on Duffy, all of which were thrown out. Political interference? Of course! In spades!

I couldn’t care less about Trudeau and his shortcomings, but I am against the Liberal and Conservative parties, two faces of the same corporate-rule over democracy coin.

Conservatives can hardly paint themselves as sweet little angels after harper. I love what Judge Vaillancourt said about that right-wing autocratic wheezer’s PMO operatives. All that’s left to debate is who’s more corrupt, the Conserbatives or the Liberals. Picking a side is ludicrous.

Well Bill, the Duffy affair was about disputed expense claims amounting to about $90k, which were paid back and he was acquitted.
The SNC-LAVALIN and Mark Norman matters involve hundreds of millions of dollars and blatant interference in judicial proceedings so, while both are wrong, the scale and magnitude of Trudeau’s actions are massively worse. By the way, Harper did not direct charges be laid or withdrawn, nor did he persistently and relentlessly try to coerce his AG into interfering in the process, a process which the Liberals gleefully supported and cheerlead all the way. Harper was not clean but nor was he bathing in the pig-sty like Trudeau.

382,Warren Kinsella,The “feminist”,2019-05-13 06:33:00,Warren,,"Ah, The Feminist.

There he was again, last week, sleeves rolled up, tie loosened. All moist-eyed sincerity, all sotto voce.

The Feminist had just athletically jogged down a flight of stairs, and paused to take media questions, en deux langues. The questions were about the total and complete collapse of his planned show trial. You know: the one to destroy Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who had had the temerity to disagree with The Feminist’s desire to hand over a fat military contract to a Liberal Party donor.

The Feminist said that the criminal prosecution of the Vice-Admiral – which The Feminist had coincidentally said was coming, well before charges were even laid – was on the up-and-up.

“The process involved in a public prosecution like this is entirely independent of my office,” he said, and lie detector machines miraculously started to stir to life, all over Central Canada. “We have confidence done in the work done by the director of public prosecutions.”

Well, that’s good to know, because the Director of Public Prosecutions Canada sure doesn’t have much “confidence” in The Feminist. Back in March, on the very morning The Feminist had refused to apologize for destroying the career and reputation of Jody Wilson-Raybould – on the very morning he refused to apologize when he and his senior staff were caught interfering in another criminal prosecution more than twenty times, over a four-month period in 2018 – the public prosecutors did something extraordinary. On Twitter.

Here is what they tweeted, in apparent direct response to The Feminist’s claim to have been “entirely independent” of a public prosecution of another Liberal Party donor. Here is what the prosectors said to the world, capturing the attention of the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group, among others: “Prosecutorial independence is key to our mandate. Our prosecutors must be objective, independent and dispassionate, as well as free from improper influence—including political influence.”

Sound like an act of defiance? It was.

But as he lingered there, for a moment or two, none of the assembled media asked The Feminist about something else. Something important. Namely, his repeated claim to be a feminist.

It would have been a very relevant question, too. Across town, Mark Norman’s extraordinary lawyer, Marie Henein – with whom my firm has done work, full disclosure – had just held a press conference with her client. And, as things were getting underway, she had eviscerated The Feminist.

“Before we get started,” she’d said, pausing. “I’d just like to introduce the all female team that represented Vice-Admiral Norman.” She emphasized the words “all female.” Then, introductions made, she went on, and no one mistook her meaning.

“Fortunately,” Henein said, “Vice-Admiral Norman didn’t fire the females he hired.”

Did you hear that? That was the sound of a metaphorical shiv, sliding between The Feminist’s ribs, aimed at the spot where his soul is supposed to be. It was Marie Henein, who actually knows a thing or two about feminism, pointing out that The Feminist had destroyed the careers of three women – Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott, and Celina Caesar-Chavannes – simply because they talked back to him. Simply because they said “no” to a bunch of men who refused to take no for an answer.

Henein wasn’t done, however.

She next took aim at The Feminist’s months-long effort to deny Mark Norman – and, inferentially, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott, and Caesar-Chavannes – the most basic courtesies. To deny them natural justice, which is at the root of all our laws. To deny them fairness.

Said Henein: “You should be very concerned when anyone tries to erode the resilience of the justice system or demonstrates a failure to understand why it is so fundamental to the democratic values we hold so dear,” she said, referring to The Feminist’s repeated efforts to interfere in the criminal justice system to reward a supporter (SNC-Lavalin) or to punish a whistleblower (Vice-Admiral Norman).

“There are times you agree with what happens in a court room there are times you don’t. And that’s fine. But what you don’t do is you don’t put your finger and try to weigh in on the scales of justice. That is not what should be happening.”

She could have mentioned, here, that The Feminist had “put his fingers” on a reporter at a beer festival in British Columbia a few years back, and about which he said “the same interactions can be experienced very differently from one person to the next.” Said “interaction” being what is regarded – in other contexts, among lesser people who don’t ride for free on the Aga Khan’s private jets – as “sexual assault.”

Marie Henein could have said that, but she didn’t say that.

Instead, she used the occasion of her client’s exoneration to point out something important about The Feminist.

<p>The Feminist said that the criminal prosecution of the Vice-Admiral – which The Feminist had coincidentally said was coming, well <em>before charges were even laid</em> – was on the up-and-up.</p>
<p>“The process involved in a public prosecution like this is entirely independent of my office,” he said, and lie detector machines miraculously started to stir to life, all over Central Canada. “We have confidence done in the work done by the director of public prosecutions.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s good to know, because the Director of Public Prosecutions Canada sure doesn’t have much “confidence” in The Feminist. Back in March, on the very morning The Feminist had refused to apologize for destroying the career and reputation of Jody Wilson-Raybould – on <em>the very morning</em> he refused to apologize when he and his senior staff were caught interfering in another criminal prosecution more than twenty times, over a four-month period in 2018 – the public prosecutors did something extraordinary. On Twitter.</p>
<p>Here is what they tweeted, in apparent direct response to The Feminist’s claim to have been “entirely independent” of a public prosecution of another Liberal Party donor. Here is what the prosectors said to the world, capturing the attention of the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group, among others: “Prosecutorial independence is key to our mandate. Our prosecutors must be objective, independent and dispassionate, as well as free from improper influence—including political influence.”</p>
<p>Sound like an act of defiance? It was.</p>
<p>But as he lingered there, for a moment or two, none of the assembled media asked The Feminist about something else. Something important. Namely, his repeated claim to be a feminist.</p>
<p>It would have been a very relevant question, too. Across town, Mark Norman’s extraordinary lawyer, Marie Henein – with whom my firm has done work, full disclosure – had just held a press conference with her client. And, as things were getting underway, she had eviscerated The Feminist.</p>
<p>“Before we get started,” she’d said, pausing. “I’d just like to introduce the all female team that represented Vice-Admiral Norman.” She emphasized the words “all female.” Then, introductions made, she went on, and no one mistook her meaning.</p>
<p>“Fortunately,” Henein said, “Vice-Admiral Norman didn’t fire the females he hired.”</p>
<p>Did you hear that? That was the sound of a metaphorical shiv, sliding between The Feminist’s ribs, aimed at the spot where his soul is supposed to be. It was Marie Henein, who actually knows a thing or two about feminism, pointing out that The Feminist had destroyed the careers of three women – Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott, and Celina Caesar-Chavannes – simply because they talked back to him. Simply because they said “no” to a bunch of men who refused to take no for an answer.</p>
<p>Henein wasn’t done, however.</p>
<p>She next took aim at The Feminist’s months-long effort to deny Mark Norman – and, inferentially, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott, and Caesar-Chavannes – the most basic courtesies. To deny them natural justice, which is at the root of all our laws. To deny them <em>fairness.</em></p>
<p>Said Henein: “You should be very concerned when anyone tries to erode the resilience of the justice system or demonstrates a failure to understand why it is so fundamental to the democratic values we hold so dear,” she said, referring to The Feminist’s repeated efforts to interfere in the criminal justice system to reward a supporter (SNC-Lavalin) or to punish a whistleblower (Vice-Admiral Norman).</p>
<p>“There are times you agree with what happens in a court room there are times you don’t. And that’s fine. But what you don’t do is you don’t put your finger and try to weigh in on the scales of justice. That is not what should be happening.”</p>
<p>She could have mentioned, here, that The Feminist had “put his fingers” on a reporter at a beer festival in British Columbia a few years back, and about which he said “the same interactions can be experienced very differently from one person to the next.” Said “interaction” being what is regarded – in other contexts, among lesser people who don’t ride for free on the Aga Khan’s private jets – as “sexual assault.”</p>
<p>Marie Henein could have said that, but she didn’t say that.</p>
<p>Instead, she used the occasion of her client’s exoneration to point out something important about The Feminist.</p>
<p><em>He isn’t one.</em></p>

Absolutely correct, Warren. The “little potato” is no feminist, nor is he a purveyor of “sunny ways”, a true supporter of indigenous reconciliation, a backer of actual “rule of law”, etc. etc. He is an out-and-out fraud and impostor, doing the bidding of his rich friends, well-practiced in bullying to get what he wants and bringing his barely-veiled temper to bear against anyone who challenges him (remember the “P.O.S” insult or the elbowing of the NDP female when trying to corral a vote in the HOC?)

ASIDE: When I heard Marie Henein make that thinly-veiled insult I laughed for hours! Clearly JT can’t handle strong women like Henenin, JWR, JP and CCC; they don’t fall for his tie-loosening, shirt-sleeve rolling fake dreamy-eyed BS.

Polls indicate Andrew Scheer has good prospects this year. Mr. Selfie certainly deserves to lose. Nonetheless, I fear the “inner Tim Hudak” in Conservative leaders. Scheer still has to go out and present a case for being the leader for all Canadians, or, at minimum, not seeking to alienate voters who are neutral to somewhat negative towards him.

It’s a bit early to be counting the Liberals out. We’ve seen polls be wrong before. Looking at the current seat projections at 338 Canada, there are a lot of seats the Liberals can win because of NDP-Green vote splits and Conservative-PPC vote splits.
A minority for the Liberals is probably as likely as a minority for the Conservatives. Scheer has to seal the deal with Quebec to win big. Forming an alliance with Quebec nationalists has been beyond the Conservatives abilities post 1988.

Reply


Gord says: 

May 14, 2019 at 2:22 pm

Harper won a majority with only 5 seats in Quebec. Population shifts have changed the dynamic from the 80s – a party can easily win a majority by doing well in the West and rural/suburban Ontario. Winning Quebec is no longer a prerequisite to winning a majority.

The Liberals are toast in the West outside inner Vancouver, Ralph Goodale’s seat, and a handful of Winnipeg seats (15 seats tops). It’s highly unlikely they’ll repeat their sweep of Atlantic Canada, but they can probably count on 25 seats. Even if they win 60 /75 seats in Quebec (up from the current 40), they are going to need to retain about 70 of their 80 seats in Ontario to hold their majority. Could be a tall order.

“Winning Quebec is no longer a prerequisite to winning a majority.”

I’ve always considered that to be Stephen Harper’s legacy. Before him, conventional wisdom said it was impossible to win without taking Quebec (and Quebec took full advantage of that, of course).

If change is the predominant mood then change – particularly in an FTP system- is what we will get.

The LPC has to make a stay the course argument. They have two potential candidates: the economy and the ‘virtue’ issues (lgbtq green etc etc)

The problem is voters who care about the first think the CPC can do a much better job and those who care about the latter have the greens and nd and bq that are better on message and haven’t got a questionable record/position.

Darwin O'Connor says:

The Wikipedia page says, “A pollutant is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has undesired effects, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource. A pollutant may cause long- or short-term damage by changing the growth rate of plant or animal species, or by interfering with human amenities, comfort, health, or property values.”

There is nothing in that definition that excludes a substance that is naturally present in the environment. In fact that page mentions Carbon Dioxide as an example of a fund pollutant.

Would you consider a mountain on pig manure dumped into a stream not pollution because some wide animal manure ends up in a stream in its natural state?

Looking at Grenier’s aggregate (along with by-election, JWR and JP speculation, and PEI), I do believe the Green Party’s current ascendance is real. I wonder if they can keep up the momentum and register in the minds of *lots*of disaffected progressive voters and nonvoters. Because I think there’ll still be a vote-Lib-to-keep-Scheer-out contingent that needs better convincing than a 9-11% polling average to vote Green. Here’s hoping. Screw Trudeau.

IMHO, it’s always the personal number (often Best PM) that kills governments. You can have a high government disapproval but if the PM is still liked, they have a chance of turning it around. Not so, if the PM is detested while the government remains relatively popular. In this case, the fork in the road is twining in the exact same direction…

Scheer needs to win a majority or he’s screwed. It’s as simple as that. With a minority, a Con government will be lucky to last 6 months. I’m not as convinced as you that Trudeau is that screwed. Given all the negative these past few months, much deserved by the way, the end of US steel and aluminum tariffs, a positive Cabinet decision on TMX pipeline, and a couple other things over the summer will do much to lift the government’s appeal. There is still a fairly big anti-Conservative movement in this country, so most Liberals will end up holding their noses and will stick with JT. The Greens do appear to have some momentum, and that’s likely where I’ll place my vote in October.

Ronald O'Dowd says:

Mark,

Trudeau badly needs a reality check on tariffs: here’s my prediction how it will go. Trump removes the tariffs, the three countries eventually ratify and because Trump will not permit language in the agreement to prevent him going forward, once ratification is complete, Trump restores the tariffs against Canada and ADDS more of them to the list. I’m waiting for MacNaughton to prove me wrong. Tick, tick, tick, tick.

True enough, just like NAFTA. Point is, not only do we get rolled by Trump but then we further inflict the damage ourselves by withdrawing? Is that really possible domestically? I know I wouldn’t do it. Canadian farmers and businesses would suffer far too much. Trump’s got all the cards, at least until 2020. Canada needs to plan accordingly.

Reply


Mark says: 

May 18, 2019 at 5:06 pm

I don’t disagree in theory. However, Trump does occasionally buckle when the chips are down and he’s shown some resolve from other counties. Case in point was Mexico and Canada saying we would not ratify USMCA without tariffs being lifted. As for your earlier comment on coalitions, agree that would be a bad idea. My point, however, is that minority government oppositions don’t need coalitions. What they need is cooperation on budget votes and other confidence matters.





Ronald O'Dowd says: 

May 18, 2019 at 11:17 pm

Mark,

Now I’m heading into the weeds: my point from Day One was that Garneau said the right thing but not at the right time. It shouldn’t have been no ratification unless…it should have been no SIGNATURE unless. That would have afforded Canada much more time to get a text in place preventing eventual reinstatement of tariffs by Trump. Then we would have moved to leverage mach two: no satisfactory text, no ratification. We can’t play that second round card now.

As an aside, I was one of Ignatieff’s most fervent backers but I totally disagreed with him on the coalition. When you get your chance, you take it, period. By backing away and supporting a Harper budget, Michael branded himself as Harper-lite. And that was more fatal than Just Visiting. By the time we finally got around to toppling Harper, the damage was done having alienated most of a progressive coalition. They sat at home on their hands while Harper went on to win a majority. A choice between Harper and Harper-lite led to the voting public choosing Harper.

Good point. I often wonder how it would have turned out what with the less than six months after an election constitutional convention = no, no.

The Greens are essentially an amorphous vessel into which progressives who are disenchanted with the Liberals and Dippers pour their preferred version of what the Greens are. They’re still benefiting from being a protest party. And protest parties always benefit from having voters not scrutinizing their platforms very much. They also tend to benefit from the media portraying them as plucky underdogs, and the media loves stories like that.

They don’t like him, but are leery of the alternative. Scheer has not closed the sale by a long stretch. One campaign blunder and all bets are off.

The Liberals will trot out their “scary Tories” playbook again and squeeze the progressive vote, just like in 2004 – ie Greens and Dippers, vote for us or you get Scheer. Could easily work again. Look how NDP support melted like snow in July in 2015 when the media anointed JT as the anti-Harper candidate.

Gord,

Let me take this apart piece by piece: first off, Harper was a right-of-centre incumbent who had been in power for ten very long and contentious years. Trudeau is hardly right-of-centre. Secondly, remember that 2004 tactics failed miserably in 2006. Scheer, by any sense of the imagination is at worst a kindler, gentler, less know-it-all version of Harper. So, running against Harper vs. Scheer is not even remotely the same ball game.

Scheer coming out against monkeying around with abortion and a woman’s right to choose is ample proof of that. Doubt Harper would ever have done that.

She says it’s true — the actions of the Liberal Prime Minister should be “of great concern for many Canadians, across the country.”

She says, truthfully, that Justin Trudeau has acted in a way that is “questionable.”

She says what happened her is “a wake-up call” — and, while she’s not happy about what Justin Trudeau did to her, she’s running again.

And — when, say, a Prime Minister Andrew Scheer gives her the legal green light to do so — she plans to tell all.

She plans to reveal what really happened “behind the veil” in Trudeau’s Ottawa.

The true story.

She’s Jody Wilson-Raybould, and she’s speaking out.

In an exclusive interview with theToronto Sun this week, the former Attorney-General of Canada spoke at length about how she’s feeling, the issues she cares about, and what the future holds for the courageous woman who shook Canadian politics to its foundations in 2019.

It’s been quite a ride for Wilson-Raybould, the Member of Parliament who started the year as the most powerful lawyer in the land — and, just 100 days later, was expelled from the federal Liberal caucus.

For being a whistleblower on corruption. For speaking truth to power. For having the guts to say “no” to Justin Trudeau and the men around him, who refused to take “no” for an answer.

The fundamentals in the LavScam scandal, by now, are well-known.

For four months in 2018, Trudeau, the Minister of Finance, and their unelected apparatchiks bullied and threatened Wilson-Raybould, demanding that she rig the system to help a seamy Quebec company — SNC-Lavalin — escape criminal prosecution for corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould refused to do so.

By the time the whole sordid affair lurched to a close, Wilson-Raybould and her cabinet ally Jane Philpott had been defamed, demeaned, and dumped from the Liberal caucus.

Trudeau had lost his two closest and most powerful advisors — Principal Secretary Gerald Butts and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

And the Liberal Party commenced a truly dramatic slide in the polls.

If an election was held today, in fact, Trudeau’s formerly-invincible party would suffer a humiliating loss to the Conservatives.

With the dust now settled, somewhat, what does Jody Wilson-Raybould think about it all?

“I am still somewhat sad,” she says.

“But, mostly, disappointed over what transpired the last number of months – given how I was removed from caucus through a questionable process and treated for doing what, at the end of the day, was the right thing to do, for the right reasons.”

She adds: “Having said that, I’m embracing my new position as an independent MP for Vancouver Granville and remain inspired by the incredible reception I’ve received from thousands of Canadians and their encouragement for me to stay in politics.”

Are they encouraging her to run again? Will she?

“My time in federal politics is not over,” Wilson-Raybould says, a bit mysteriously. “I will be making a decision shortly. Stay tuned.”

The LavScam scandal — more than the Aga Khan mess, more than the disastrous India trip, more than Trudeau’s policy fumbles on China, NAFTA, pipelines and federal-provincial relations — dealt the deadliest blow to the Liberal leader’s re-election hopes.

Before LavScam, most everyone had seen a second Trudeau majority government as inevitable.

Not now.

Wilson-Raybould agrees.

Says she: “[LavScam] was a wake up call for many – a peek behind the veil of how Ottawa works. I know, like me, many of the class of 2015 who came into federal politics for the first time truly believed there was a different way to do politics. We knew what this was supposed to mean. Unfortunately our experience did not match expectations or the standards we had set ourselves. The last months have led me – and I suspect many of my former colleagues, and I know countless Canadians – to pause and consider the way the system works.”

Can that system ever change? What needs to change? Wilson-Raybould doesn’t hesitate: politics which are “less partisan,” she says.

Freeing MPs to “truly represent their constituents.” And – contrary to what happens in Justin Trudeau’s Ottawa – a Parliament “where truth is expected.”

After all that has happened — after all that she has endured — does Jody Wilson-Raybould still have a truth to tell?

If Justin Trudeau is defeated, and his successor removes the cabinet confidence/solicitor-client privilege gag he’s slapped on her, will Wilson-Raybould finally tell us what happened “behind the veil?”

Jody Wilson-Raybould doesn’t hesitate about that, either.

“I will speak the truth,” she says, adding that she will certainly do so — when she is finally “free to do so.”

Promise to give Jody Wilson-Raybould the freedom to speak her truth, Andrew Scheer.

Put it in your election platform.

The truth, as they say, will set you free.

Definitely. Loved the lines about promising to let her speak, and “put it in your platform” (some good advice).

Now I’m left with no choice but to vote for her, if she still runs in my riding of Vancouver-Point Grey (preferably as an independent; it would just be weird if she ran for the NDP).

As more and more threads unravel, more and more Trudeau unravels. He’s become paranoid and behaving with increased desperation: buying the media, gagging those around him, fearing question period, resorting to smearing his opponents, and petrified of being unloved.

The ignorance about “…the way the system works.” on the part of the vast majority of Canadians – particularly, in my experience, Western Canadians astounds me.

It’s not like this hasn’t being going on for just a short time – we are talking over 50 years at least and I am open to the argument that it is what the country is based upon.

Perhaps it is the fault if a highly centralized and compromised media, perhaps it is laziness on the part of Canadians, perhaps it is naiveté. Probably all three. But if an MP and then Minister didn’t even understand it then the country needs a sharp and quick lesson on how the system works and why it must stop.

If JWR leaves the liberal party how can she still be gagged? Just do it already. Join anybody and get the story out. Leak it if you have to.

Trudeau is using every bully pulpit to change the channel and there is nothing to counter him. Even the paid off MSM is complacent. Somebody drop the bomb.

I believe it is because Trudeau has not waived full solicitor client privilege so she can speak freely…only partial…it’s obvious he has not provided full waiver as that information will be damning…I’m am not clear however from the story how Scheer could waive it if wasn’t part of Trudeau cabinet. Warren?

BC Guy,

Ditto re: cabinet confidence. In our system, what one government does, another can undo. Or if you prefer, if Trudeau says it’s an apple in law, Scheer can come in and decide it’s an orange in law. As simple as that.

I believe the story is referring to cabinet confidentiality, not solicitor client privilege. But I could be wrong, as her client was the government, not Trudeau.

I don’t know what part of the story was true, but apparently Harper had to agree to waive privileged in the Vice Admiral Norman case. Thankfully, he cared enough about the rule of law to allow it.
But I suspect that Trudeau will waive nothing. Solicitor-Client privileged is one thing, but I suspect that even Cabinet confidence cannot be broken. The more JWR talks, the more the Liberals will say that she has said all there is to say, while everyone else will realize that there are many more questions left to answer – if only she were allowed to answer with the whole truth.

363,Warren Kinsella,"My latest, on the so-called “digital charter”",2019-05-25 07:44:00,Warren,,"The Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development blinked. Then he blinked again.

He has just been asked if his government’s “Digital Charter” would apply to his own political party. You know, the governing Liberal Party of Canada.

He doesn’t answer. The host on CBC’s “Power and Politics” genially tries again. Will the Liberal Party agree to go along with the rules it proposes to impose on everyone else? Will the Grits practice what they preach on data privacy?

Navdeep Bains, the Minister with the aforementioned long title doesn’t answer. Again.

Bains rallies. He sternly says the penalties for violating Canadians’ privacy will be “substantial.” The CBC inquisitor asks what that means.

Navdeep Bains doesn’t say.

And so it goes, as with much that the Justin Trudeau regime does: do as they say, but not as they do. Talk the talk, but don’t walk the talk.

Justin Trudeau does that sort of thing a lot: you know, oversell, then underdeliver. Insincerity, phoniness, dishonesty. It’s his brand, pretty much.

And there is no better recent example of that sort of rank hypocrisy than Justin Trudeau’s so-called“Digital Charter.”

Announced a few days back with much fanfare, but not much detail, the “charter” sketches out some basic principles about data protection and online privacy.

Justin Trudeau, as is his wont, revealed the “Digital Charter” in Paris, where he knew his audience was likely to be less critical than the ones back home. Overseas, Prime Minister Chewbacca Socks can still command the occasional round of applause.

Not so much back here in the colonies, where the “Digital Charter” is like so much that Trudeau does – all sizzle, no steak. All talk, no action.

That’s not to say Trudeau’s “Charter” – he calls it that, presumably, because it sounds like he’s serious, when he isn’t, really – doesn’t have some laudable goals. It wants to combat the spread of hate and violent extremism online, and who could be against that?

Except, well, Justin Trudeau has had nearly four full years to do something about the explosion in hate online. Every other Western democracy has done something about it. But Justin Trudeau? He waits until we are a mere 100 days or so from the 2019 election kick-off, and then claims he’s The Hate Fighter™️.

Oh, and his “Charter” isn’t going to become law until (a) after said election takes place, and (b) he is re-elected. The chances of which, all the pollsters tell us, is presently somewhere between slim and none.

It’s a problem. A big one. In an era where Facebook and other online behemoths regularly steal the private information of citizens, and profit from it, Canadians actually need something like the “digital charter.” At the moment, regular folks don’t have the ability to control – or consent to – the way all the political parties use their data, either.

In 2019, when the tech giants steal your private information, they get fined pocket change. And the political parties – when they do likewise – they don’t get fined at all. They get away with it.

The federal Privacy Commissioner, who has saint-like patience, has recently held press conferences about this outrage. He’s even brought along the Elections Commissioner, who has nodded his head and soberly agreed: the Trudeau government needs to be subject to the law, just as every other citizen and corporation is.

But Justin Trudeau refuses.

With less than a month to go until the House of Commons rises for the Summer, not to return for many months, Justin Trudeau needs to put his mouth where our money is. He needs to agree, finally, to practice what he preaches to the rest of us.

Will he? Don’t hold your breath.

But hold onto your data.

Oldest trick in the book. Problem is, Trudeau has already played that card before: “the last Canadian election held under the first-past-the-post system”, wasn’t it?

Not familiar with it, but I hope it offers substantial privacy protections. If you live in a hyper-partisan society – so entrenched it starts to look more like a dictatorship – then you can feel why privacy is so important.Without privacy we aren’t equal or free – the strange brew of anti-social media, a steady stream of propaganda and routine privacy breaches – ruins free society.

They’re using privacy violations as a means to rationalize unearned status – in hyper-partisan society’s, or provinces, they’re using unconstitutional privacy violations to control the society, single people out for harassment, and that goes along with whisper campaigns and propaganda – it’s fascism they have to legislate against – really, it’s the emergence of techno-fascism that will erode the free society we all enjoyed – people can’t thrive under those circumstances it enables cronies and entrenched Nativist loyalties that diminish the value of freedom

360,Warren Kinsella,What JWR has to say,2019-05-27 07:03:00,Warren,,"…about something that matters a lot.

**

“A new nation-to-nation process,” they said.

“We will renew the relationship between Canada and Indigenous Peoples. It is time for Canada to have a renewed, nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples, based on recognition, rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership,” they said. “This is both the right thing to do and a sure path to economic growth.”

That’s what they said. That’s what Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party pledged to do in their 2015 election platform.

It’s still online, and relatively easy to find. That’s surprising, because it all reads like the Soviet Constitution, now: all stirring, uplifting phrases, none of which are meaningful. Hope and change, signifying nothing.

It worked, however. In crass political terms, it worked.

When compared to 2011, the Indigenous vote went up significantly in 2015. On some First Nations, they ran out of ballots.

CBC’s resident election nerdling, Eric Grenier, wrote about it in the days after Justin Trudeau’s smashing triumph. The growth in Indigenous vote was “widespread and significant,” Grenier declared, and the Liberals “benefited most from this increase in indigenous voting.”

They sure did. Elections Canada said the Indigenous vote was up a huge 13 per cent, the biggest increase in a Century. And the Grits were obviously the clear beneficiaries, says Grenier: “In the seven ridings with at least one-third of the population identifying as aboriginal, the Liberals won four of them and came a close second in the other three as their vote increased significantly.”

2015: sunny ways, happier times. And then 2019 hit.

The LavScam fundamentals are well-known, by now, and don’t need to be repeated ad nauseum, because they are truly nauseating. Justin Trudeau and his underlings bullied and brutalized Jody Wilson-Raybould to give a corrupt party donor a corrupt deal to avoid a criminal trial for corruption. Obstruction of justice, interference with prosecutorial independence, no more debate about “the legalities,” as Trudeau’s inept Chief of Staff memorably put it.

Wilson-Raybould was dumped because she said “no” to Justin and the boys who wouldn’t take no for an answer. She was driven out of the Liberal caucus, too, and attacked by the selfsame Liberals who promised, in 2015, to “renew the relationship between Canada and Indigenous Peoples.”

This part bears repeating: Jody Wilson-Raybould is an Indigenous Person. She’s a former B.C. Grand Chief, too, and leader of the B.C. Treaty Commission. She’s been a councilor for the We Wai Kai Nation. And, most significantly, as Attorney-General – as Minister of Justice – she was an important symbol. She was one of the greatest success stories Canada’s Indigenous people have ever known. They were, and are, very proud of her and her achievements.

And now, they’re angry.Really angry.

“I’m absolutely pissed,” Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, told APTN when asked about Trudeau’s brutalizing of Wilson-Raybould. “The bullying and deceit coming out of the PMO in regard to this entire matter – it just represents the absolute dark underside of federal politics in this country.”

“Justin Trudeau, your misguided colonial approach to reconciliation has now cost you the most brilliant Cabinet member, [one who] has mountain ranges of integrity. First Nations and women voters will remember your actions in October 2019,” warned Bobby Chamberlain, former vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

Months later, First Nations are furious, still. But what does Jody Wilson-Raybould think?

In an exclusive interview, Wilson-Raybould is – characteristically – not bitter about Justin Trudeau’s broken promise to Canada’s First Nations. Asked whether Trudeau’s treatment of Wilson-Raybould has hurt federal relations with First Nations, the now-independent MP muses.

“Hmm,” she says. “I would say yes and no.”

She goes on: “On the one hand, these events have demonstrated that there is still a long way to go for transformative change in this country for Indigenous peoples. Words matter, and actions are required. Over the mandate of this current government, significant investments have been made in Indigenous communities to address day to day issues and this needs to be acknowledged.”

She pauses. “However, on creating the space for the more transformative change, increasingly many people – both Indigenous and non-Indigenous – are questioning the legitimacy of the [Liberal election platform] mantra that ‘no relationship is more important than to this government than the one with Indigenous peoples’. For our Indigenous peoples, working hard to create the space to be self-determination in this country – based on the recognition of rights – has been and will continue to be a priority, one that has been pursued for decades. This will not change.”

But. There’s a but: “The events of the past few months perhaps has strengthened this resolve while at the same time highlighted that there is still a long way to go.”

What abouther, though? What about what Justin Trudeau did to her? Jody Wilson-Raybould reflects.

She says: “If you are asking about how people view my treatment…I have been greatly supported across the country by Indigenous peoples. The actions of the Prime Minister and the government have been of great concern – to say the least – for Indigenous peoples, and certainly for many Canadians across the country.”

Will Indigenous people punish Justin Trudeau at the polls? Will they withdraw the support they gave him in 2015?

On that, Jody Wilson-Raybould pauses a last time. She says, definitively, that she is running again to represent her Vancouver riding.

And she won’t be running for Justin Trudeau’s party","<div class=""articlecontent"">

With respect, JWR is shooting for the stars. IMHO, remaining an independent is a strategic mistake. Even if the Trudeau Liberals nosedive, does anyone realistically see the possibility of reintegration, much less favourable optics for an eventual leadership run?

Liberals know Liberals. They have a long and vindictive memory. In short, many will move heaven and earth to make sure she never becomes leader. It’s definitely not a certainty but that tact is an odds-on favourite.

Meanwhile, what the hell are the rest of us supposed to do? We can’t vote for party x to support her in our own ridings…

What’s the endgame here? I respect their decision but where’s the opening for all of us who want to support JWR and JP?

How can we translate our vote across the country as a message of support for both of them? We are denied that now.

Certainly not the strategic decision I would have recommended.

Your response sums up how I feel about this. Way over here on the east coast, I was hoping to park my vote with them, if they chose a party. Alas, all that remains after this decision is the usual stuff I didn’t want to vote for. I’m sure running as independents makes sense to them for lots of reasons, but it doesn’t do much of anything for me at this time.

The end game here Mr. O’Dowd is to actually do what one often hears from prospective MPs and Prime Minister’s come campaign time – when one says I’m in it not for myself, or my Party, but the people in my community…. and then actually keep your word. She’s offering to represent her Riding based on her naked values and principles and smarts and talents and experiences. Full Stop. (Your previous reference to ‘reintegration with the Liberal Party” and “future Leadership aspirations” under Liberal brand were offensive and narrow-minded.

While it can’t always be “all about you” Mr. O’Dowd, one bit of advoce to your conundrum of not being able to support Jane and Jody because you can’t vote for them in your riding – as a start, you may want to consider NOT voting Liberal. Let’s start there Sport. And the, let’s wait until the campaign commences and platforms and planks and promises are made, shall we?

Honestly, it’s all three. I’m quite deliberately arrogant because I think Canadians deserve better. In my book, I’m entitled to a party that puts country first, not lying and bullshitting their way into power, above all else. Read the full of shit twins: LPC and CPC. Both of them would sell their souls to keep or get into office. Things are long overdue for drastic change in Ottawa and a JWR and JP line up with the NDP or Greens would have been one hell of a good start.

You know Fred, we may have our differences but we all — bottom line — love and are proud of this country. What makes us great is that we listen and respect those we happen to disagree with. We aren’t always practically at each other’s throats like the Yanks.

Why can’t the fucking parties be a true reflection of that? Why does it always have to be smoke, mirrors and most of all bullshit? I have no great love for any of them but I need a protest vehicle so this time, having run out of realistic options, it’s going to be NDP. But if they do politics like the other two parties: read bozos, it won’t be the NDP the time after that…

“You know Fred, we may have our differences but we all — bottom line — love and are proud of this country.”

(very well said, Ronald. I’d vote for you, if you ever ran…)

But sadly, the party system is corrupt to the core, and no one is ever able to keep their soul pure and stay in caucus. I’ve seen a few people (you have too, I know…probably even more) go into politics with good intentions, only to find their idealism stripped from them along with their individuality. It’s a sad state of affairs, but what can we realistically do about it?

Maybe it’s time to bring back the Rhinoceros Party?








WestGuy says: 

May 27, 2019 at 1:49 pm

Probably the smartest move.
-Run Independent, win or lose it doesn’t matter as long as Trudeau loses.
After losing, Trudeau resigns as leader. Leadership campaign launches
-JWR and/or JP run for leadership. Having run as an independent and not under a different party, they wouldn’t be labeled as political opportunists and Liberals-of-convenience.
-They frame leadership campaign on transparency, ethics and trust. Either on wins (probably JWR).

Hard to see how Philpott could hang on in Markham-Stouffville. Seems unlikely that the Conservatives won’t once again deliver 23-25k votes, Philpott would have to deliver the vast majority of Liberal 2015 votes – unless she somehow can make inroads into what looks like a stable Conservative base.

Vancouver Granville rather harder to read, both as a new riding, more of a 3 party race possible, and a much larger margin of victory in 2015.

I think what they’ve done is made voting in this next election a very boring, uninspiring affair, generally, unless you live in their ridings. Just the usual slate of blue-red-orange-green candidates, all from parties that are either unsupportable (in my view) at the present time, or have very low likelihood of making any impact.

As independents, their capacity to make a difference outside of their ridings is small. I hope they choose another vehicle later. Maybe they are awaiting Trudeau’s implosion to complete itself before running for LPC.

While I appreciate JWR standing up to the Laurentien elite, be very careful here. Her views on reconciliation do not square with the idea of Canada as a nation. Read her manifesto. It calls on ceding all national decisions to oversight or even veto to indigenous peoples and setting up permanent reparations. While I am all for them participating in the success of this country, that is the wrong way to do it. This is likely the real reason Trudeau turfed her. He opened the door to something and had to put it back in the box before it got out of control.

Agreed. Trudeau Sr left time bombs that will continue to hold Canada back for generations: the flawed repatriation of the Constitution (impossible to amend, guaranteed seats to certain provinces meaning that the HoC will never provide Rep by Pop), flawed Charter of Rights (too much focus on positive rights and not enough on negative rights guarantees government scope creep over time, not enough mechanisms to push back on court decisions, recognition of group rights which counters the notion that all individuals are equal) and the Canada Health Act (no extra billing, no privation, no room for provinces to innovate, no clearing provincial or federal accountability)

This is an historic moment, and I hope a new beginning for independent candidates.

As I’ve posted many times before, the Canadian party system is horribly flawed. Everyone other than the leader, and perhaps a few key cabinet ministers, are irrelevant. You might as well elect a trained monkey. They all toe the line, and just parrot what the leader says. Your local candidate is, usually, irrelevant – no matter how good a person they are in “real life”.

We need a system that stops rewarding and supporting the status quo. We need to end Elections Canada policies that make it very difficult to run as an independent. We need MPs to be free to vote against their party, without bringing down the government.

Let’s hope JWR and JP are the start of something new and better. They are excellent flag-bearers for change.

I think the play is this: once PM Zoolander is inevitably removed / resigns as leader, say Novemberish, one or both of these women will be running for the Liberal Leadership.

You know I won’t be inviting Harper to my next birthday party but could you have pictured him being run around by the nose by C-A-U-C-U-S? If I was PM, I would have told them to go fuck themselves.

Totally agree, Ronald. But Stephen Harper, for all his faults, was at least a real leader; it remains to be seen how either of these women might do at the helm of a major political party.

A workable scenario, to me, is someone else taking the leadership and inviting JWR and JP back. That would send a strong message, and eliminate the need for personal animosities (well, not *all*of them, but still…).

357,Warren Kinsella,Copp out,2019-05-28 07:37:00,Warren,,"In one of my books, The War Room, I have a chapter called the Scandal Handle Manual. Here’s a bit of it:

None of us Chrétienites hated Martin or Gomery, particularly, but nor did we like them all that much either. Still, every once in a while, I would get really, really mad about Martin and Gomery and what they did in 2005 and 2006. Their legacy wasn’t a happy one: destroying the name of federalism in the province of Quebec; providing lots of ammunition for the separatists at the time of the next referendum; ruining the reputations of dozens of innocent people; and, worst of all, ensuring that millions of voters are even more cynical about political institutions than ever before. There weren’t words, really, to describe the nature and size of Martin’s bullshit. For guys like me, it was easy to get mad about it all.

But we — me in particular — resolved to keep our cool. Be passionate and tough as James Carville had been, sure, but don’t lose your temper. Don’t let them see you sweat. In any scandal, your demeanour is key.

LavScam was important for a number of reasons. It showed that Justin Trudeau lied about being a feminist and indigenous reconciliator (see: he kicked out Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott because they spoke up). It showed that he lied about his intention to clean up government (see: his willingness to obstruct justice and breach the public trust). It showed that he couldn’t handle a crisis if his life depended on it.

(see: his decision to use Sheila Copps as his spokesperson).

Here’s some of the stuff Sheila Copps has said on behalf of Justin Trudeau:Copps said Jody and Jane are pus-filled “boils.” She actually said that, many times.
Copps, sounding like a Proud Gal, said Jody had an “aboriginal agenda.”
Copps said Jody cared more about “aboriginal” jobs than, presumably, jobs for white people.
Copps attacked the courageous Kristin Raworth, one of the victims of Kent Hehr’s sexual harassment
Copps loved Trudeau’s libel lawsuit against Andrew Scheer, which everyone else thought was the stupidest thing in the history of the world.
Copps had a poor command of facts (eg. she falsely claimed Scheer recanted after being served with the requisite libel notice – when the Conservative leader in fact repeated the alleged libels, word for word, outside the privileged confines of the House of Commons)

And so on.

The moment that PMO’s Team Op-Ed™ started relying on Sheila Copps to get out their side of the LavScam story, their octopus was cooked.

Per what I said in The War Room, above, using Sheila Copps showed that Trudeau and his fart-catchers were desperate. It showed that they were lashing out. It showed that they didn’t have anyone credible left to defend them.

There is one thing worse than using Sheila Copps, however.

And that would be your own Chief Government Whip, someone you made a member of the Queen’s Privy Council, quitting your government in the same week he let it be known he would testifying against you in another corruption scandal – and even showing up at the courthouse to hug the respected Armed Forces leader you tried to destroy.

The definitive proof that Copps was a venal, mendacious partisan hack came many years ago — that was when she promised to quit if the Liberals didn’t get rid of the GST, as they had promised to do on the campaign trail in 1993. Then it turned out that “quitting” in Copps-speak meant simply stepping down and instantly running again in her safe Hamilton riding. Zero integrity. Zero.

I’ve never supported the Liberal party for rational reasons (ex. disagree with their tendency towards centralizing economic and political influence, economic protectionism and many others). Of all the emotional reasons to hate the party, Sheila Copps ranks near the top. She does across as needlessly confrontational, self important and most of all, delusional. In what version of reality was she considered cabinet material?

I remember two things for her time as Heritage Minister that should have ended her career:1) She made a speech where she said she would stop more condos from being built along the highway in Banff National Park. Obviously she has never been to Banff, which isn’t surprising
2) I worked for a telecom equipment manufacturer and was Product Manager of a voice mail product. I received a letter from the Heritage Ministry signed Sheila Copps, but probably written by someone else, warning that the GoC might purchase from another vendor going forward as our product only supported UK and US English. Heritage wanted a “Canadian” version with “zed” voice prompts, extra “u’s” in the documentation etc. I priced out the development costs at ~$180K but bid it at $2M hoping that would be a disincentive as we didn’t want to devote resources to such a frivolous customer demand. Not only did the GoC approve the cost, it also signed off on an extra $4M for the reseller to install and train staff on the new Canadian voicemail.

For me JWR allegedly having an “Aboriginal Agenda” is a selling point.

I’m a social and political conservative from a small northern community. Although I’m mostly of caucasian ancestry, some of my family through adoption and marriage along with a number of close friends are of First Nations ancestry.

I have seen the multigenerational damage Indian Residential Schools have caused to Indigenous Canadians. I believe it is comparable historically to the damage wrought on the African-American community in the U.S. through slavery.

One of the reasons I as a male conservative respected JWR is because of her ability to overcome differences in gender and culture while presenting an Indigenous Canadian perspective in a manner that was better understood within the wider Canadian community.

And one of the reasons she was able to do so is because one sensed in her that fundamentally she was an honest and decent human being working for the betterment not only of her people, but of all Canadians. In short, she does not come across as a politician.

Warren I like your commentary and critique on Trudeau and his cult but you are absolutely 100% on the wrong side if history when it comes to the democrat crazies. Trump is about to send them to the woodshed for a generation. Open borders, unrestricted immigration, socialism are dead issues. So is unfettered abortion up to the 3rd trimester. You are worried about kids in cages but not ones having their lives ended by some razor thin legal argument.

50M babies aborted last yr. Does that sound rare to you? 50% of these are little girls. How do you square those rights? Max is right.

This whole horrible thing is about to be put back in the bottle.

353,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: Scheer, Trudeau and racism",2019-05-29 09:27:00,Warren,,"When everyone is a Nazi, no one is a Nazi.

When you falsely insinuate your principal opponent is a Klansman – as Justin Trudeau’s party has done, repeatedly and recklessly, with Andrew Scheer – it fosters cynicism and disbelief.

Most of all – and I say this as someone who has researched, opposed and written about organized hate groups for more than three decades, and has received innumerable death threats along the way – likening a partisan adversary to a white supremacist makes it impossible for activists like me to sound the alarm about real white supremacists.

Despite all that, for many months, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal echo chamber have hissed that the Conservative Party leader is a far-Right racist. It has been despicable and dangerous.

The experts agree, too. Gavriel D. Rosenfeld is professor of History at Fairfield University, and he’s the author of The Fourth Reich: The Specter of Nazism from World War II to the Present.

Says Rosenfeld, who knows more about this subject than anyone alive: “Too many hyperbolic comparisons – for example, between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler – dulls the power of historical analogies and risks crying wolf.”

Crying wolf: that is what Trudeau and his party have been doing. So desperate are they to be re-elected, they have been prepared to imply that Scheer is the worst thing that one can say about anyone: that he is a fascist. That he is an adherent of the ideology of murder.

Last night, Scheer – finally, firmly – slammed the door on Trudeau’s slur, and strongly condemned organized hate. It was overdue.

“There is absolutely no room in a peaceful and free country like Canada for intolerance, racism and extremism of any kind. And the Conservative Party of Canada will always make that absolutely clear,” Scheer thundered in a Toronto speech.

“I find the notion that one’s race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation would make anyone in any way superior or inferior to anyone else absolutely repugnant. And if there’s anyone who disagrees with that, there’s the door. You are not welcome here.”

For weeks, Scheer had been dogged by an allegation that he willingly appeared onstage at a February “United We Roll” protest in Ottawa with a notorious white supremacist, Faith Goldy. In fact, Goldy was nowhere near Scheer. She wasn’t even in the permitted area, she wasn’t invited to speak, and she was later condemned by official organizers.

Scheer – who, like Justin Trudeau, has had past media encounters with Goldy, before she went full-blown bigot – should have denounced Goldy’s ilk sooner. But this week’s speech has now left no doubt about his views. Haters have no place in his Conservative Party, he said, in the important speech titled “Unity in Diversity.”

Said Scheer: ”We should be able to have an immigration debate in this country without the government calling its critics racists and bigots,” he said. Trudeau’s willingness to to do so, Scheer added, amounts to “cheap partisanship” and it hurts our collective ability to oppose the very real threats of racism, bigotry and extremism.

If Trudeau wants to denounce real bigotry – and he, and all of us, should – he should train his sights on Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party. Bernier and his cabal have devolved into the porch-light of Canadian politics, attracting all the bugs and the creepy-crawlies. (Which should make it easier to deploy the necessary political insecticide.)

But this dishonest Justin Trudeau campaign against Andrew Scheer? It must stop. It has engendered cynicism and distrust, and that’s the last thing any democracy needs in the Trump era.

Andrew Scheer has told us where he stands on one of the crucial issues of our time.

Having been involved with the Reform Party back in the day, I seem to recall the following were targetted by the Libs as allegedly “racist”:
1. Ending so-called “hyphenated” Canadians, and focusing on integrating immigrants into becoming Canadians first and foremost. One proposal was to end funding that was specifically focused on multiculturalism.

2. Repeal of the Official Languages Act, and thereby reducing the obligation to use French and English in all government matters.

3. Discontinuing affirmative action and other preference-based (“reverse discrimination”) hiring practices at the government level.

There may have been others, but these are the ones that stick out most in my mind.

“Discussing immigration – including numbers – is not racist.”

Exactly. There are a small percentage who are indeed racist and will vote for whatever party they think is closest to their views on immigration, but the vast majority are normal people who are tired of being accused of this crap. Right-wing populists have been elected all over the world because of it, and will continue to thrive if the left doesn’t grow up and change tactics.

Ditto for “Islamophobia”, “homophobia”, “transphobia” and all the other divisive, politically-motivated nonsense that they continue to blow far out of proportion. “Transphobia” (fear of change? really?) will be the first to fall, as the feminists are up in arms about being told who is a woman and who is not; the women’s sports organizations, faced with the prospect of their complete collapse, have now begun to ban “trans” competitors after a couple of eye-opening incidents.

There is way more to it than that, but the bottom line is you can’t solve a problem without discussing it, and you can’t discuss it with one side screaming at the other to “SHUT UP!!”

The reason Trudeau isn’t going after Max Bernier’s party is simple – the People’s Party is only getting 1% to 2% in the polls, and so doesn’t have a hope in hell of ousting the Liberals and forming the next government.

Thanks to Trudeau we now have some immigrants calling us white supremacists, racists, European Imperialists, and making other racist comments.

He is the one causing all this trouble with racism. I, as thousands of other Canadians judge people on their actions not their race. Before Trudeau showed up I had never seen so much racism from all races in this country.

Immigrants in this country from the beginning have made lasting friendships, as I have with people of other nations that have come to our country and tried to blend in and get along.

I am sick to death of what this fool has done to my country, turning races against one another and causing trouble between the male and female population.

He will continue to do this if he gets in again, and may God help this wonderful country with so much hate being spread around due to a spoiled, almost 50 year old teeny-bopper who knows nothing about anything – except looking in the mirror and telling himself he is irresistible.

I also feel this is a serious vindication of Dr Jane Philpott. She was not the one being pressured to cover up. She easily could have pretended this was not happening and left JWR to stand on her own.

Instead Dr Jane Philpott stepped out and sacrificed a lucrative political career to stand by JWR when she most needed it.

While I am completely on side with the cause, I honestly can’t find any definition of genocide which does not include intention. Improperly using that term for the MMIWG report erodes the seriousness of what has happened. This PM is tossing the word around simply because he thinks its popular to do so, which is despicable. He has achieved the impossible – making this situation WORSE.

A genocide. Not really.More like 1000’s of woman murdered or missing because cops didn’t care the government didn’t care and because they didn’t care men chose to rape and murder woman because they could get away with it. Including cops across Canada involved in murder and cover up.So let’s focus on the real reason….no accountability for crimes committed especially against average Canadians and especially the less fortunate. The justice system bears the brunt of this mentality which brings about rape and murder. Rape victims treated like the criminals. RCMP that are a disgrace as seen in a tape of a young indigenous teenager . One that caused outrage. Why do we need outrage to solve a problem and get an investigation . Pathetic justice system and law enforcement whose abuse of the rights and freedoms has resulted in this traveety of missing and murdered first nations girls. Look at the case at Donald Best.ca where a judge and defence lawyer had private criminal correspondence contained in a secret file. Incredible fraud on the courts . Let’s see what occurs. A cover up only compounds the problem of people thinking they can go unpunished including raping and murder. That is why we have this tragedy. Not a genocide. What moron would call it this is clearly not fit to oversee anything.

This was the potential risk with the inquiry, from day one. The organizers and authors of the inquiry competing with each other as to who can come up with the greatest hyperbole. Now the chickens have come home to roost.

Yes, it is a tragedy that these women were murdered, or went missing. Yes, it is at least partially a product of poverty and ongoing challenges in the Indigenous community. But it is not “genocide”. To call it such is a huge insult to people who have suffered actual genocides (Nazi Germany; Ukraine holodomor; Rwanda; etc…).

It’s not a surprise that the MMIWG authors ended up using the most provocative word they could summon, but it is unfortunate that there is acceptance of that word in the name of political correctness.

That’s why a smart PM wouldn’t have even opened this inquiry when it was already proven that most of the murders were committed by indigenous men, and that the solve rate for these murders was comparable to that of general society.

So if Trudeau was simply acknowledging that genocide had occurred at some point in the past (i.e. not on my watch), and given his propensity for apologizing, what is the time frame for when genocide occurred? Was it on PET’s watch? Chretien’s’ (Minister of Indian Affairs), Turner’s? Mulroney’s? on whose watch? Given the clear and precise nature of Sock-Boy’s ubiquitous apologies in the past, a nation (or 2 or 3 if you count Indigenous and Quebecois) awaits Trudeau’s parameters around his yet latest “I’m sorry for the genocide you experienced that happened before I showed up”.

The scandals continue. Appears more to come. The lawyers in the country should slap on some courage and make some noise. They are rather silent. Scared to play in the big leagues or can’t hurt our friends.

Perusing the criminal code of Canada and it’s amazing what you know can be used but not. Especially to protect friends and the money from drying up to stay in power and enjoy eliteness status. Someone needs to pay for the summer cottage thats bigger then most people’s homes and keep the mistress happy with expensive gifts. The mistress won’t stick around if not splurged upon with lavish stuff.

So interesting charge in the Code.. leaving Canada to engage in a group or terrorist activity or upon arrival having engaged in a group or terrorist activity So the mobsters who leave to do business in Italy or in the Dominican Republic for casinos or elsewhere have they not committed this crime??? Over and over again? What’s the RCMP doing.

So scandal after scandal rocks the crooked no matter what government they are. Same mobsters same law enforcement same crooked businesses money laundering and engaging in bribery and other criminal acts. They leave go do businesx of bribery etc. Then they come back to Canada. The same for the organized crime that comes to Canada and engages in crime on Canadian soil and leaves to go back to China for a bit. Then comes back. How come no seizure of property obtained by proceeds of crime used?

I guess lawyers are silent on the real big stuff. They don’t know how to read the law properly. More like a slanted version of t. Rather not see it. The law is simple the subversion takes more work.

Our police forces are throwing out criminal harassment charges against whistle blowers. Especially police who blowvthe whistld on corruption. Illegal ones of course. To silence. We can find many criminal code violations for that too. But silence on the truth. Silence on legitimate stuff.

So this current spineless government rocked by scandals ethic breaches RCMP engaged in market manipulation to protect the pocket of the PM which is criminal the attacks on honest people like Mark Norman s the legacy that these morons leave. The investors defrauded as one’s in power protect their friends or themselves.

And I’m glad you also picked up on the importance (and bone-headedness) of Scheer’s refusal to attend any Pride parades. Tons of ammo now for the “hidden agenda”, “scary social conservatives” narrative the Liberals are sure to run on in the fall. This was an easy way to reassure the suburban voters (particularly women) that he needs to win that he’s not some Lake of Fire nutjob, and there was no downside to going (it’s not like it was going to cost him votes at the end of the day).

Perfect chance to underline his “there’s the door” narrative, and they blew it.

Scheer is damned if does and damned if he doesn’t attend a Pride parade. If did plan, organizers would likely say he is uninvited, which would only call more attention. If by chance some organizers extended an invitation, he would look awkward and out of place.

Politicians attending Pride has become a cliche. It is nothing more than a checkbox. A brave Scheer could state that the community fought and won its deserved rights and then maybe crack a joke about how he would look even more out of shape in that crowd.

In Toronto, there is controversy about police not being allowed to march in the Pride parade. As such, the public agrees that politicians should boycott until this is changed. I understand Edmonton is in a similar controversy. I am not sure how many other Pride parades are suffering from the same anti-police sentiment, but if it’s most, then Scheer is right to skip them.

Doug,

As I recall, Harper, unlike Bernier, gave Pride parades and events a wide berth. It doesn’t dawn on rank amateurs that top politicians should find out organizers’ views before attending events…who wants to go there and get systematically booed. But if organizers have an open mind, they would meet politicians half way and let them attend. They could learn from each other and better advance issues important to the LBGTQ 2 community.

I’ve heard it said that if everyone is a Nazi, then nobody is one. The same applies to over using the word Genocide or attending parades. The PM’s job is to attend national parades and events such as Remembrance Day and D-Day. If a PM starts attending municipal parades, he diminishes the importance of his attendance at any parade.

Attending local parades was not something that was viewed as being worthy of having the PM attend. This was the philosophy for may a year, until Trudeau came along. I don’t recall Harper, or Chretien, or Mulroney, or Trudeau Sr. attending any Pride parades, or Santa Clause parades, or any other parades. (possible exception in their own community where they attended more as MP and not PM).

Walter,

I would put major party events below Pride and other parades and funny how no leader ever manages to miss any of them, when it comes to raising the almighty party $$$. Says a lot about some political parties, doesn’t it?

Well said, Walter.

The irony here is that many of the people who are pushing Andrew Scheer to attend these parades are doing so, as Ronald alludes to above, mostly so they can jeer at him, boo him and create a new embarrassing incident for the evening news. They would never vote for him anyway, so why play their game? Seems like a lose-lose proposition to me.

And for those who stick to the liberal narrative of, “it shows your support for gay rights”, the Conservatives have already done that for years now.

agreed… too busy, too much. If I were a CPC ad guy, I would simply use the most platitude riddled speech PM Zoolander has ever made as a sound track. Then I would roll contradicting visuals of all the disastrous headlines of the past 6 months. Literally hearing one thing and seeing another naturally conjures up visceral anger.

and… I’ll post it again. IMHO this is still the best CPC ad ever made. simple, focused, no narrator tells the viewer what to think, it just leads them in the right direction.

1. I think all ads should be voiced by Scheer.
2. Ads should also end on a positive note – i.e. we have strong women such as Rempel, Raitt, Bergen and we will respect them.
3. So far, I like that corruption add that pans the camera from Trump to Trudeau. Also the one where Scheer says he will work for the middle class – because that’s where his roots are.

Harper’s mouth sank Harper. Trudeau’s mouth didn’t bumble and ruin his chances in 2015. Trudeau’s mouth is sinking him now while Scheer’s says one smart thing immediately followed by a stupid thing. If Scheer can practise self-discipline, he wins. Otherwise, he loses and can kiss off a majority.

341,Warren Kinsella,My latest: when Trudeau calls it genocide,2019-06-08 16:14:00,Warren,,"Genocide.

That’s what the Prime Minister of Canada says Canada is guilty of — the crime of crimes.

That’s what the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal called it, too, when passing judgment on Jean Kambanda, who oversaw the slaughter of more than 800,000 Tutsi and Hutu civilians in Rwanda in the Spring and Summer of 1994: “the crime of crimes.”

Said the tribunal: “Genocide constitutes the crime of crimes, which must be taken into account when deciding the sentence.”

Kambanda, like Justin Trudeau, was a prime minister. Like Justin Trudeau, too, he admitted he had facilitated genocide.

Unlike Justin Trudeau, Kambanda is now serving a life sentence.

Trudeau, however, has imposed a political sentence — on himself. On Tuesday, in Vancouver, he talked about the report released by the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.

“It was genocide,” Trudeau said.

On Wednesday, one day after the Canadian Prime Minister said Canada had committed genocide against thousands of Indigenous women and girls, the Organization of American States announced it expected Canada to cooperate with its investigation.

Justin Trudeau is now the first Canadian Prime Minister to be investigated for state-sponsored mass murder by an international body in which Canada is a member state.

During a federal election. That, too, is a first.

In a letter sent to Canada’s government, the Secretary-General of the OAS wrote: “The mere presumption of the crime of genocide against Indigenous women and girls in your country should not and cannot leave any room for indifference from the perspective of the Inter-American community and the international community. Given that your country has always sided with scrutiny and international investigation in situations where human rights are violated in different countries, I am expecting to receive a favourable response to this request.”

It didn’t matter, at that point, that various eminent Canadians had said Trudeau had been wrong to say his government, and all of his predecessors’ governments, committed genocide. Former Liberal minister of justice Irwin Cotler was one.

Said Cotler: “If we say everything is a genocide, then nothing is a genocide.”

Retired general Romeo Dallaire, who commanded the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda when Jean Kambanda was facilitating genocide there, was another. Dallaire, a former Liberal Senator, sounded angry at Trudeau.

“I’m not comfortable with that,” he said. “My definition of genocide (is) a deliberate act of a government to exterminate, deliberately and by force and directly, an ethnicity or a group of human beings. And that meant actually going and slaughtering people.”

That’s how most other experts define genocide, too. State-led, state-sponsored, state-sanctioned mass murder of citizens belonging to a particular race or religion or ethnic group.

On the day the inquiry issued its damning report in Ottawa, calling the murder of thousands of Indigenous women and girls genocide, Trudeau declined to go along. He wouldn’t call it genocide. By the time he got to Vancouver, however, Trudeau had changed his tune.

“It was genocide,” he said.

At that point, the OAS — and, possibly, the International Criminal Court, and other such bodies — had no choice but to act. And Canada, having called for investigations into other nations over the years, has no choice but to cooperate. Its Prime Minister had admitted to the crime before an investigation had even begun.

Was it the ethical thing to do? Was it morally right? Was it the biggest self-inflicted political wound in Canadian history?

None of that matters. Genocide is the crime of crimes.

Three points:
A) Saying, like Ronald, that one will “go” with what aboriginal peoples think shows that the word is being used as a piece of political rhetoric rather than the legal concept it is. It’s like saying that in a murder trial we should dispense with judges and juries and just go with what the victim’s family thinks. It also leads to the conclusion that, as we are all guilty for what happened to those aboriginal women, nobody really is.

B) Given the histories of the treatments of aboriginal peoples in Central and South America, I find it rich that it’s the O.A.S. that is calling us out. It’s something I would have expected more from self-righteous Nordics. I have to wonder whether there isn’t an element of schadenfreude in play here. Payback for Canadians and Canadian governments calling them out?

C) A lot of people will find the charge ridiculous but will say nothing because it’s hard to do so without sounding like you are saying “Oh c’mon, it wasn’t that bad”. But I note that this inquiry was supposed to be about missing and murdered women. Real people who can be identified. To conclude an expensive, multi-year inquiry without addressing the roles and responsibilities of aboriginal men, families and communities and just jumping straight to boilerplate genocide charges by one collective against another leaves me without much respect for Canada’s aboriginal leadership.

Peter,

I don’t know. The easy political out is to say that every Canadian in this society is being blamed. That’s not the conclusion I come to. It seems to me that proponents are making the case for genocide writ large on an institutional and governmental basis. Taken from that standpoint, the argument is far more credible and worthy of very serious reflection, to say the least.

“The easy political out is to say that every Canadian in this society is being blamed. That’s not the conclusion I come to. ”

How do you read this, Ronald?
————

The report also strongly focuses on the need for actors in the justice system and in police services to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has been largely defined by “colonialism, racism, bias, discrimination, and fundamental cultural and societal differences.”

“Cultural”? “Societal”? Sounds like individual Canadians to me.

Do you mean it wasn’t you and it wasn’t me, it was all just a bunch of nefarious politicians and shadowy officials? As comforting as that may sound, I don’t think it will do. In the late 19th century and well into the 20th, almost all non-aboriginal Canadians were in favour in one form or another of what today would be considered assimilation. Some were brutal, racist social darwinists who were happy to enforce their mission civilisatrice with a big stick. Others were empathetic, compassionate types who believed it was a very long term endeavour and sought to protect aboriginals from exploitation and abuse. But almost no one except a few eccentric Grey Owl types thought they could build a prosperous future in the long term by staying in their remote communities, hunting like their ancestors, pursuing aboriginal spiritualism and educating their kids in aboriginal languages.

This thinking met its Waterloo in 1969 when Trudeau Sr. introduced his White Paper, which called for the repeal of the Indian Act, the end of Indian Affairs, granting freehold title to aboriginal lands and the end of all legal disabilities. It was very warmly received by progressive Canadians, who were embarrassed by official discrimination and inspired by MLK and civil rights in the States. But while they heard emancipation and equality, the aboriginal peoples heard assimilation. This led to the beginnings of today’s aboriginal organizations and activism, and they stopped it cold. Aboriginal people excel at thwarting the efforts of non-aboriginals to solve their problems and “improve” their lives.

If I understand the current thinking of many aboriginal activists, Trudeau, his ministers and most of liberal Canada (the NDP was hostile to distinct aboriginal rights until well into the 70’s) were advocating genocide. I was never a big Trudeau fan and I believe current thinking is superior–it’s certainly more respectful of aboriginal wishes–but I also think the charge is absurd and insulting and I’m not going to change my view just because aboriginal activists keep insisting it was in ever-shriller voices.

There’s something about a man who apologizes for the actions of others but can’t quite see why he himself should do so for his very specifically own behaviour and conduct… to elevate himself, claiming some ever higher moral ground for himself. But instead of doing the normal thing like, maybe apologizing to those who he tried to make an example of – and we know the more public instances – Mr. Trudeau instead acknowledges the “crime of crimes” – genocide. Leaving aside the question of what other states do with that (they’ve now been advised that they’re trading with a genocidal society) – if the expanded understanding of genocide is to stand, if that flag has been planted, for narcissistic self-redemption, attention-seeking, or crass political opportunism – the next question is what else should be called that. Additional arguments can be made for expanding it to our homeless. And so, we’re potentially into a competition of who can out-moral the other – standing on the most vulnerable for their political soapbox.

Exactly. Canada has had multiple leaders over the past 50 years so there must be a common thread. What is that? The leaders didnt care. The law enforcement that care more about protecting the crooked rich dont care. Its blowing up in all their faces. Each leader was corrupt its just a matter of when the their sins become public knowledge because of whistle blowers. Then they get tossed out. Every survey they make is rather useless and they should know that by now. People are not always truthful on surveys. When Trump won Kathleen is interviewed saying she cant understand how the polls were wrong. Well thats pretty sad. She should know better. She knew the scandals would stop her from winning again. Doug Ford won because typical of Canadians they just vote for someone to get rid of the most hated leader. Thats why he won big. Few months later he is being rocked by scandal after scandal too. Why dont people open their eyes to that fact. Trudeau will take a butt kicking and be kicked out. Its so predictable. Thats what happened to Harper. The Mike Duffy scandal rocked them good. Thats why Trudeau won big. Not because of pot legalization. Not because of his platform. Only because Canadians wanted Harper gone. Trudeau has been booed for many of his years in power across Canada. His ethic breaches covered up. The SNC Lavalin affair. The Mark Norman charade of a trial. All of it is known and will result in the butt kicking. Shutting down Twitter using fake Media to control what is said blaming Russian interference. None of it will matter. Canadians pretty much are predictable. Remember the polls tried to say Harper was close to Trudeau. Such propaganda.

What Canadians want is leader that cleans up corruption. Not covers it. They will keep electing another leader in the hopes that one will do it. But sadly none of them do, Look at BC and David Eby. He is launching a public inquiry into the money laundering and casinos. Yet some propagandist tries to state that the BC economy will collapse. What a joke. It will do no such thing. In fact it will prosper if you clean it up and seize properties and assets and send the criminals packing. That is what all Canadians want. Most definitely honest Canadians in BC. Only the crooked agree with such an erroneous article that the economy will collapse. BC residents who cant afford homes because of the money laundering has sent the market higher and overpriced homes could now buy the seized properties at a fair market value and own a home. Something they cant do now. Over priced higher end vehicles that get you from A to B. At a lower priced. So time to kick the criminals in the butt. Time to take your leaders to task and tell them to step up to the plate and do what the average Canadian wants. Not what the crooked want.

So the missing and murdered woman in our First Nations for many years is not the result of one maniac leader but a culmination of lack of leadership and caring by the elected leaders because they only care about themselves and who they can help prosper. The inquiry and reconciliation done on behalf of the First Nations has been a farce. Too political and thats why it tanks in any form of proper recommendation. How about instead of giving 40 million to Canopy Growth for the start up of pot (and I am sure the investigators are getting close to the real owner of the land that Canopy Growth is using will be outed and I could say who I think it is but will let the investigators reveal it ) that they give the $40 million to the First Nations to build their lands and homes and have clean water and help policing to crack down on murderers and rapists and other criminal acts done in order to help the First Nations. Do you think thats a great recommendation so then where is the media to demand that Canopy Growth give the $40 million back and it be redirected to our First Nations. Thats the mark of a leader who deserves to do the job of protecting its citizens. Yes I think our leaders have forgotten what their job entails and that is protect the health and safety of their citizens and aid them in prospering. All the leaders over 50 years have failed miserably in protecting the First Nations especially the woman and children.

It also takes us back to the terrorism root-causes debate for which the PM was almost universally derided. Trouble is, we are always so quick to pounce on a direct cause without doing the further intellectual work that’s required.

Terrorism has root-causes, as does the murder of First Nations women and girls. Root-causes are not necessarily a direct cause but they are often fundamental to true comprehension and examination of an issue. It’s easy and rather convenient to ignore that often crucial piece of the equation.

If the actual answer was as simple as “We use refillable water bottles”, don’t you think he would have said that? This does not appear to be stumbling due to general awkwardness. This appears to be stumbling because he knows he would be lying if he said they used refillable water bottles.

True. Losing one’s train of thought or stumbling over words happens to all of us, and one could cut him some slack over that. What is most telling here is that he seems to have no good answer to the question, because he’s not doing anything personally to reduce his plastic consumption. In order to avoid looking hypocritical, he desperately reaches for an answer, which turns out to be nonsensical.

Of course the most logical explanation is that he really doesn’t mean any of it, but that would entail that he’s just pretending to care.
That may be true, but where oh where would one get the idea that Justin Trudeau is just a preening pretentious pontificating impostor.
No, thar can’t possibly be.
Now as to the most logical reason for this announcement that has been telegraphed since Saturday, that could be that the liberal insider polls (the ones they don’t publish) show them losing significant support to the green party.
Just for giggles lets presume that when the returns come in on Oct 21, the seat count shows that even with NDP and Green support that the liberals still need two more seats to have enough votes to pass that first confidence vote?
Now lets add one more condition that the two seats they need support of are held by two female independent MP’s that got kicked out of the liberal caucus.
Would their price be readmission to the liberal caucus and having a leadership vote at the next convention?

I’m happy to see this posted, because this morning just as I parked my car at work a radio host reading the news chose to air some of Trudeau’s speech about “what do I tell my kids about dead whales?” and other nonsense.

(I’m literally yelling at my car radio that “…you tell them that it’s really sad that China and India keep THROWING THEIR GARBAGE INTO RIVERS, isn’t it???”

(because by now everyone knows that 95%+ of all plastic in the ocean comes from Asia, right? Everyone except Junior, apparently…)

So, not a great way to start the day. I go in to work.

Later, I go out for lunch…and of course CTV NewsNet is playing in the restaurant, and now they’re running the video of that same speech. Great. I mumble a few obscenities and try to tune it out.

But as I drive home after work, a different host on that same radio station decides to play this very same clip of Trudeau attempting to answer this unscripted question, then right afterwards plays some funny music (I think it was the Looney Tunes theme from way back). I burst out laughing….it was hilarious! The day was saved.

So thanks to our host for choosing to feature it. If, as most Canadians will, you only see the prepared speech you might get the idea that Junior is a serious, committed environmentalist with a well-formed plan to deal with a problem he finds personally troubling…but when you see the rest, you’ll see him as the shallow, self-serving opportunist that we all know him to truly be.

I laughed out loud at that. Tory talking points on this are pretty good.

“The facts about Trudeau’s “drink box water bottle sort of things”

When Justin Trudeau was asked about small actions his family has taken to reduce plastic waste in their household, this is what he had to say:
“Uh, we, uh, we have recently switched to drinking, uh, water bottles out of, uh, water out of, uh, when we have water bottles, uh, out of plastic, uh, sorry, away from plastic towards, uh, paper, um, like drink box water bottles sort of things.”

Syntax aside, here are the facts about Trudeau’s “drink box water bottle sort of things”:
“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are way more expensive than normal bottled water: A 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better sells online for $44.96 USD. By comparison, a 24 pack of Nestle is currently on-sale for $2.50 CAD at Loblaws.

But, nothing is cheaper than good old-fashioned tap water! At the price of a 24 pack of Boxed Water is Better, the Trudeau family could easily afford a top of the line Brita filter.

“Drink box water bottle sort of things” are actually less environmentally friendly than plastic water bottles: According to the Alberta Bottle Depot Association, boxed water containers are less recyclable than plastic water bottles, and that consumers are more likely to recycle plastic water bottles than boxed water containers.

Trudeau hasn’t entirely switched to “drink box water bottle sort of things”: Just like how the Trudeau Liberals jet-set around the world to photo opportunities at international conferences, while at the same time lecturing families using a car to commute to and from work, it appears Justin Trudeau’s environmentalism is Not as Advertised.

“Plastics in the ocean are an Asian and developing nation problem.”

It was proven years ago that Asian and Africa are responsible for over 95% of it. I don’t mind efforts to reduce their use, strictly from a litter standpoint, but an outright ban is ridiculous (especially of plastic bags, which serve a useful purpose and are nowhere near as harmful as the eco-weenies would have us believe).

338,Warren Kinsella,My latest: it isn’t genocide,2019-06-11 14:57:00,Warren,,"Genocide is one of those words that one does not toss about, like confetti. One does not treat “genocide” like it has no meaning.

It has a very specific meaning.

Justin Trudeau knows it is a serious word, because of what he has said in the recent past. He knows that the word “genocide” describes the most serious crime there is: murder on a massive scale, by a state power, targeting citizens because of their religion or race or ethnicity.

He knows that.

So, in the House of Commons in September 2016, as Prime Minister, Trudeau said: “This government recognizes that acknowledging genocide should be done on the basis of extraordinary facts and wise counsel internationally, not just on political grandstanding by members like the member opposite.”

That’s what he said. Earlier, in June of that year, the Liberal Prime Minister said this: “Mr. Speaker, we feel that determinations of genocide need to be done by objective measures and through proper research on the international stage. We will not trivialize the importance of the word ‘genocide’ by not respecting formal engagements around that word.”

In the same month, Trudeau also said that his government “understand[s] how important it is not to trivialize the word ‘genocide’ and to give it the international legal weight it deserves. That is why we are asking the international community to examine the facts and make an objective determination. We do not want to play petty politics with this issue and these atrocities. Canadians expect better than that from this government.”

And, again in June 2016, when the Conservatives were hounding him about the Islamic State and genocide: “We do not feel that politicians should be weighing in on this first and foremost. Determinations of genocide need to be made in an objective, responsible way.”

And so on, and so on. You get the point. He knows what genocide means. He knows that it is a word that must be used with great, great care.

Last week, Justin Trudeau said that Canada, and Canadians – and every government that preceded his – had committed genocide against Indigenous people. Specifically, the thousands of women and girls whose murders were documented, and lamented, by a National Inquiry he himself created.

The head of the inquiry said that Canada, and Canadians, committed genocide. You, reading this newspaper, committed genocide. Me – the proudest father imaginable, to a beautiful and sweet and perfect Indigenous girl – committed genocide.

You didn’t. I didn’t.

Were we – as a people, as a nation – indifferent for 150-plus years? Yes. Were we inattentive? Yes. Were we ignorant? Yes. Were some of us racist and cruel and simply evil? Yes, yes and yes. All those things.

But the murder of thousands of Indigenous women and girls was not a state-sanctioned, state-led, state-mandated act of genocide. It was a series of murders, committed by individuals, not the state. Fully deserving of investigation and prosecution, still, because there is no statute of limitations on any murder.

When the National Inquiry’s report was handed to him, Justin Trudeau did not say this: “Was it state-sanctioned genocide? No. But we, as a nation, were negligent. We were wrong. We were to blame. So, today, I’m announcing the creation of a fully-funded national police task force to investigate and prosecute these many murders. We will not rest until we get justice for these women.”

That’s what Justin Trudeau should’ve said. He didn’t.

Instead, he spent the morning in Ottawa doing some verbal gymnastics, trying to avoid acknowledging that genocide had taken place. By the time he got to Vancouver, however, he had reversed himself. “It was genocide,” he said at a conference, to some applause.

The international community – the one which Canada belongs to, and which we regularly give pious lectures about things like genocide and crimes against humanity – immediately took note. Within a matter of hours, the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States had formally written to one of Justin Trudeau’s government, demanding its compliance in an investigation of acts of genocide committed by Canada against Indigenous people.

Justin Trudeau, at that moment, had made history: he will be the first Canadian Prime Minister to be investigated for genocide during an election campaign. It is a bit of history that will not end well, for him.

Justin Trudeau, being an actor before he is anything else, knows the importance of words. He knows the impact they can have on one’s audience. That is why, until last week, he was always careful not to use one word, above all. He knew its power: “genocide.” The crime of crimes.

The power of that word will now be used against him.

Then look at Article 3 – you don’t need to intend it to be punished – complicity is just as bad and that’s just what we’ve been for the last 150 years.

The fact that ever since the report came out most all the ink is writing about is it or isn’t -instead of figuring out how to fix whatever it is – shows just what a weasel nation we are.

“ oh it’s not that bad” ranks right up with “ we didn’t know” in my book and it’s disgusting!

Is it possible that everyone who believes that Canada committed Genocide – that being everyone who voted for Trudeau’s Liberals – gets deported to the country of their ancestors. I see that as the only way for these people to repent and make amends for their part in the crimes.

thank you for posting “clearing the plains” on youtube. i note that comments are disabled, a wise move. i’ve read the book and use it as a resource to contextualize disease historically on the plains people. it certainly looks like genocide by non-the-less hero j a macdonald. ‘starve the indian to the point of death’, for land and the railroad. as a treaty indian and old elder and residential school attendee i am deeply saddened by the toxic dialogue ensuing from the mmiwg final report in ‘ appropriating’ the term “genocide” in situating violence experienced by mmiwg. at first i was upset by the report’s use of “genocide” but am rethinking. what concern me are the attitudes reflected in negative comments in the media towards indigenous people and the politics.

It is understandable you are upset by some of the commentary. Unfortunately, the word genocide not only has a technical meaning, it is loaded emotionally and implies the most unspeakable acts humans have ever inflicted on one another. To most people, it means the intentional mass murder of very large numbers of people for no other reason than they are who they are. The Inquiry not only used the word to describe something quite a bit less than that, no matter how shameful and destructive, it used language that suggests it is still ongoing and that all Canadians are complicit. It should not surprise anyone that many people reject that and respond with their hearts as well as their heads. Please do not make the mistake of interpreting these reactions as historical denials or opposition to Indigenous causes. I think it is a big mistake of some aboriginal leaders to use inflammatory, degrading language in these situations and not expect non-aboriginals to reject it and defend themselves.

Sorry, Ronald. I looked forward to seeing if there was anything new in the report (doubtful, after the number of times it has already been done, but you never know, right?). Instead, I was insulted and accused of complicity in murder. I REJECT THAT.

Unfortunately a lot of the discussion on this issue immediately gets muddled because people don’t distinguish between historical acts by the Canadian government and Crown (some of them going hundreds of years back), versus what the Canadian government is doing today.

I stand to be corrected, but I gathered that what was so controversial (and I think incorrect) about Ms. Buller’s assertion was that she was accusing the current Canadian government of engaging in genocide as we speak. Today.

I think there are lots of people, most people — myself included — who realize that there are acts that took place historically that could fit the definition of genocide. But that is an important distinction and quite different from asserting that today, Canada is doing that.

Doc,

I would put it to you that there’s at least a generalized complaceny across Canada as regards First Nations management by the very federal government that is supposed to help lift many of them out of third-world conditions.

Can anyone argue that non-Aboriginal efforts, across departments, have frequently only fallen short of absymal failure?

The feds have never ever come close to a B and that chronic state of mismanagement is totally unacceptable. It’s high time for First Nations to become the fourth order of government and manage themselves. They couldn’t possibly do any worse than the feds. In fact, given a chance, they ultimately can and will do far better.

https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2019/06/11/blowback-to-the-word-genocide-proves-the-national-inquiry-report-was-right.html

As Ms. Talaga effectively demonstrates, there is a serious misunderstanding of what the use of the word means in international law. Who should be prosecuted? Trudeau, Harper and every surviving PM? Every MP and former surviving MPs? The current G-G and every surviving former G-G? How about every Canadian citizen and do you include or exclude Metis? What about a recent immigrant who just became a citizen? March them off to Brussels in handcuffs as soon as they take the oath too? As Warren points out, genocide is not just a shocking word that can be thrown around to get attention to an issue. They haven’t thought this through and are simply viewing things through their (justifiable) anger.

As someone (I can’t recall who it was) put very well the other day: unfortunately in the age of social media and professional activism, there’s this need that activists feel to be heard above the din. This leads them to use ever more inflammatory and hyperbolic language. It’s pretty clear, listening to the commissioners who issued the report that that was a big part of their motivation, i.e., getting attention. Well, they’ve succeeded in that. Whether they have actually helped their cause long-term is another matter.

For example, the fact that a progressive like Warren with obvious pro-indigenous cred would write an article like this speaks volumes. In politics and in public policy, when you alienate your friends, that’s a problem.

Of course it’s not genocide ! We’re nice polite Canadians , we don’t do atrocities , we’d never think of being complicit in any atrocity.

In fact , the worst behaviour any Canadian is capable of is cheering a (possibly career ending )injury of an opponent during a basketball game.

Of course it’s not genocide. And when the OAS finishes their investigation and says it is – or is tantamount to it , as they certainly will, we can all join in with the holocaust deniers and say “ oh it wasn’t that bad”

But here’s the money quote from the Talaga article :
In any case, surely something is wrong when so many expend so much more energy defending colonialism against the “genocide” allegation than grappling in good faith with the cruel consequences the commissioners chronicle or their 231 recommendations for redressing those consequences.

How many Canadians can name even one of the recommendations?

Christian says:

And why do you think that is? Because by using such a controversial and explosive word like ‘genocide’ the commission trampled all over its own message and created the massive distraction away from its own findings that Ms. Talaga is lamenting. Again, they did not think this through and failed to appreciate that some words like ‘genocide’ really do matter and carry all sorts of implications.

Exactly. The problem with so many activists these days is that hyperbole is the first (and sometimes only) tool that they reach for. And in some cases, hyperbole backfires on you and hurts your cause rather than helps it.

The problem is, though, that these activists are often so bound up in their own righteous, ideological bubble that they think anything done in seeming advancement of The Cause is good and justified.

Warren,

In the final analysis, the genocide debate is nothing short of a legal and semantic political sideshow. For SOME, it’s a convenient red-herring that: a) promotes their desire not to seriously address the Commission’s recommendations and b) keep First Nations’ people in their “place”. It has become a debate about us, rather than an urgent response to conditions affecting them, and the unacceptable life circumstances many First Nations face.

If a majority of Canadians genuinely care about First Nations’ well being and development, then why isn’t there an outcry from NL to BC in favour of Aboriginal Self-Government? No one can honestly argue in 2019 that First Nations can’t run themselves. They already have, for the most part, the high-quality leadership required to successfully do the job.

But the sad reality is that many Canadians remain, even today, absolutely opposed to First Nations Self-Government and that speaks far more volumes about us, than about them.

(from the G&M 2016)

———————–

Those who are pushing for a national, government-run pharmacare program see it as a necessary measure to control the growth of pharmaceutical expenditures.

What these supporters fail to mention is that such programs keep spending in check by rationing access to new drugs, rather than by being more efficient.

Foreign experience can teach us much about the dangers of adopting a monopolistic drug insurance plan in Canada. The United Kingdom is among the countries that have pushed this line of reasoning the furthest. As a result, U.K. patients for many years had to do without drugs that were approved and recognized as effective and available all across Europe. These restrictions have in all likelihood played a role in the U.K.s’ lower cancer-survival rates compared with most other industrialized countries.

New Zealand, often held up as the ideal model to emulate, provides another cautionary tale. Of all medicines registered between 2009 and 2014, only 13 per cent were added to the list of products that are funded by the country’s public insurer, Pharmac. According to a recent study, 75 per cent of New Zealand general practitioners said they had wanted to prescribe an unfunded medicine in the previous six months. Some New Zealand patients have even emigrated to Australia to access required medical treatments for multiple sclerosis and HIV infection.

Some argue that a government-run pharmacare program would improve access to prescription drugs for the most needy, but international comparisons suggest otherwise. According to a study by the Commonwealth Fund, in 2013, 8 per cent of Canadians with below-average incomes said that they had not filled a prescription or had skipped doses in the previous year because of cost. Although there is room for improvement, this is on par with Germany (8 per cent) and is notably better than France (11 per cent), Australia (14 per cent), and New Zealand (18 per cent) – all countries with national pharmacare programs.

————————

That’s only a couple of the arguments against this….there are more (reduced R&D, to name just one). I know you are an NDP supporter and all, but nothing like this comes without consequences (like, who exactly will pay for this program, and how?). Sometimes I too wish that life were as simple as the NDP seem to believe it to be…but alas, it is not; in the real world (where most of us live) good intentions aren’t the same as good policy, sorry.

How much R&D is funded through government subsidies (i don’t know, just wondering), and how much private sector budget goes to lobbying, and marketing? Again, I don’t know, I’m just wondering – look at antibiotics – they only do R&D when it’s profitable – is this a press release from a lobbyist? In the real world people get sick, so if you have a public hospital system then a public pharma-care system makes sense –

All of those countries have far fewer drugs covered. Especially the new blockbuster drugs. People in Scandinavia have to go to France to get their – very expensive cancer meds or the latest and best types of insulin.

The only way such systems can even remotely maintain fiscal lines is more and more limitations on what’s available.

So add a deductible at the bottom and let insurers administer a spending account for $50 a month. Not a lot of big companies offer individual plans to all their staff, they use group coverage for a reason, so if you want to make sure everybody has coverage, a big group plan is the best way to do that

If you want a revenue stream in addition to saving costs at the bottom with a deductible, then a health tax on fast food, sugary drinks, snacks etc –

Yes can the Chinese stop sending to Wal-Mart plastic containers that keep getting thinner and thinner each year especially at Black Friday, Plastic that breaks after one use.

Uh duh. Our prime minister isn’t up to speed what families know in Canada. Garbage products from Canada.

But then again it appears a cover up to the Liberal MP from BC caught with his pants down with Chinese organized crime and his law firm that helped money launder for the Kingpin.

Warren, serious question and not to poke the PM further on this – I’m trying to make a more objective observation of what seems to have happened to JT’s mojo.

If you accept or even suggest the premise that the PM was and always has been a little bit out of his depth in this gig but perhaps was able to at least appear like he had a grip on things because of his skills in “acting” the part with his usually great oration, I wonder if some of his latest flubs are simply a product of his own personal and newfound understanding that many people have started to simply not believe “the act”?

If I were trying to portray myself as something and review after review (or poll after poll) said “we simply don’t believe you” or “you are no longer credible,” I might be begin to panic. I might especially panic if, for instance, I didn’t have a long and storied career in business or the private sector or much anything else to fall back on with regards to my record – foreign affairs, trade, economic strategy and…well, canadian unity.

My sense is that he looks, sounds and feels vulnerable and his “performances” of late reflect just that. My two cents, but wondering what you think is behind him so consistently going “off script”…

He knows he is deeply unpopular – a Forum Research poll released this week found that 56 disapprove of his performance, with only 34 per cent approving – so he needs to act quickly. The election is just over 100 days away, give or take.

The Liberal leader’s task: find someone who is less popular than him. But who?

For a while, Trudeau attempted to convince Canadians that Andrew Scheer was a cross-burning, mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging, red-necked lunatic. He’ll ban abortion, gay marriage and hold midnight rallies at 24 Sussex with Faith Goldy, Trudeau insinuated.

Except: Scheer said he won’t do any of those things, and polls indicate Canadians tend to believe him. Hell, Trudeau’s own Liberal caucus doesn’t even believe it – selfsame Liberal caucus having voted to instal Scheer in the Speaker’s chair, a few years back.

In his commercials, Scheer celebrates his blandness, his ordinariness. As he lopes around the hockey rinks of the nation, Timmie’s in hand, Scheer repeats his mantra: “I’m Blandy Andy, and I’m boring. You can count on me to do nothing radical. Go back to sleep.”

As Bill Davis memorably observed, eons ago: bland works. It’s working for Andrew Scheer.

So, who now to demonize, Prime Minister Chewbacca Socks? NDP leader Jagmeet Singh? That’s a waste of firepower. Singh, likeable as he is, is going nowhere fast.

Same with the People Party’s Gauleiter, Maxime Bernier. Trudeau doesn’t want to demonize Bernier – he wants him to do better, and chip away at Scheer’s lead in the polls. But Bernier has gone full alt-Right, and thereby consigned himself to the margins of Canadian politics, and the dustbin of history.

The Green Party’s Elizabeth May, meanwhile, is a worthier target: the aforementioned Forum Research poll has determined that May is the most popular leader in Canadian politics, with voters approving of her by a factor of two to one.

Her party, meanwhile, has reached a truly historic benchmark: Forum found that the Green Party of Canada is now actually tied with the New Democrats, at 13 per cent apiece. Many expect the nascent Greens to eclipse the Dippers in coming weeks.

Trudeau hasn’t attacked May – yet. But he has been, ahem, liberally swiping her policies to halt her momentum. His single-use plastic announcement, which made the wetsuit-and-jetski-era Stockwell Day sound perfectly Churchillian, was a disaster. It became the stuff of memes – and future attack ads – instantly.

All of it was motivated solely by Trudeau’s desperation to staunch the loss of Liberal support to the Greens. It is unlikely to work, because May is simply seen as more credible on the environment than Trudeau.

So, who to attack? The answer is obvious: the Mango Mussolini. Donald Trump is deeply disliked by Canadians from East to West, old to young, Left to Right. There is nothing that unifies Canadians more than anti-Trump sentiment.

But Trudeau has spent three years cravenly sucking up to the Unpresident, with nothing to show for it. It’s too late to do a volte-face now.

So who is left to demonize? Who, truly, is Justin Trudeau’s worst enemy? Who should he blame before he blames anyone else?

The conditions are not trivial. Trudeau and Freeland surrendered out ability to retaliate effectively if the tariffs are re-imposed (can’t target agricultural goods no more), and the conditions are also a-quota-by-another-name, since any increase in exports in Canada is likely to be called a surge, triggering re-imposition.

The Trudeau and mainstream media narrative of the deal was a carefully crafted PR exercise to not make it look like surrender.

Excellent and accurate analysis, but my faith in the Canadian voter is somewhat limited, given prior experiences and current conversations.

It never ceases to amaze me, as to the narrow lens through which many voters see the world. They hone-in on extremely limited issues, and make that the entire basis for their voting decision.

I often wonder if we should have intelligence tests for voting: if you can’t discuss 5 top news stories off the top of your head (and they can’t include celebrity or sports topics), and explain the basic principles of how an economy functions, then you don’t get to vote.

That would certainly disenfranchise a lot of economists. Just ask them.

This called epistocracy and it’s a horrible and dangerous idea. It used to be associated with parts of the right, but today we’re starting to see more of it from progressives and soi disantexperts frustrated to near-madness by repeated electoral losses. Political life is not a problem-solving college seminar and the case for democracy is not that it guarantees the wisest policy choices, but that, pace Churchill, all the alternatives are so much worse. Besides, just reflect on how many disasters the “best and the brightest” have led us into in the past.

330,Warren Kinsella,Five free comms tips for Justin Trudeau,2019-06-18 06:58:00,Warren,,"The Gettysburg Address it was not.

Standing on the picturesque shores of some picturesque lake in Mont-Saint-Hillaire, Quebec, Justin Trudeau was asked what he and his family had done to cut single-use plastics out of their lives.

Here is what he said, verbatim.

“We…uh…uh…we have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of…water out of when we have, uh, bottles out of, uh, plastic, sorry, away from plastic towards, uh, paper. Like, drink box water bottles sort of things.”

The Liberal Prime Minister’s was so proudly unintelligible, so defiantly incomprehensible, it instantly went viral, supplying fodder for dozens of anti-Trudeau memes across the Internet for the next 100 years. It was mocked and maligned from coast to coast to coast, including by people who actually still sort of like Justin Trudeau. Heck, the clever Sodastream beverage people even put together an ad about it, with the tagline: “Justin, just say Sodastream.” Trolled by a big international company: ouch.

It reminded all and sundry that Gerald Butts has indeed left the building, and that Justin Trudeau has started to sound like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, except way worse. Or Zoolander, even, but on a bad day.

How did the oxymoronic brain trust in Trudeau’s PMO not see that coming? How did they not supply the Actor-In-Chief with an answer to one of the three most enduring political questions, namely: “Do you practice what you preach? (The other two being: “What did you know and when did you know it?” and “Why did you party on that boat with a bunch of topless co-eds?”)

Since it is becoming evident that Chief of Staff Katie Telford and Liberal campaign manager Jeremy Broadhurst couldn’t communicate their way out of a moist, environmentally-friendly paper bag, it is incumbent upon the rest of us to provide Prime Minister Chewbacca Socks with some communications guidance.

Herewith and hereupon, the Hill Times’ Five Immutable Comms Rules, gratis.
Don’t mangle the message, man. Last week, in the wake of the important report by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Justin Trudeau declined to say “genocide” had taken place. A few hours later, he flip-flopped and said genocide had taken place. Then, a couple days later, he changed his mind again, and said it wasn’t genocide, but “cultural genocide.” In the process, Trudeau sounded like the aforementioned Messrs. Gump and Zoolander. As such, it was essential that Trudeau’s Great Big Announcement about single-use plastics be clear, consistent and coherent. It wasn’t.
Don’t sell snow shovels in June. Or, in this case, don’t make a Great Big Announcement – and we know it was a Great Big Announcement because your office had been telegraphing that for days – when the biggest sporting event in Canadian history was also taking place. You know: that little match-up between the Toronto Raptors and the Golden State Warriors. It was in all the papers, Katie and Jeremy: it was kind of a big deal, in the immortal words of Ron Burgundy. Pro tip, Justin: if you are proposing something to fundamentally change the way millions of Canadians will live their lives, don’t do it when Canadians are paying attention to someone who has fundamentally changed the way millions of Canadians now live their lives, cf. Kawhi Leonard. Just don’t.
Don’t wait too late. In slightly more than 100 days, the writs will drop for the 2019 Canadian federal general election. Why, why, why did the Trudeau Party wait untilnow to make their plastics announcement – when the European Union, among others, had done likewise long ago? Announcing something this big, this late, convinces the few folks paying attention (see point two, above) that it was a cynical, desperate move to halt the undeniable momentum of the much-admired Liz May. Because it was.
Don’t forget to make it relevant. The banning of plastic straws became an early and frequent target of Trudeau’s announcement. Parents of autistic kids, for example, reminded Trudeau that their kids needed such straws to, you know, consume liquids. Why, then, didn’t Trudeau focus on the number one source of single-use plastic pollution. Namely, cigarette butts. They’re unsightly, they’re ugly, and they’re universally disliked. They’re made out of cellulose acetate, which is plastic. But Trudeau’s press release didn’t even mention them. Dumb.
Don’t be a hypocrite. Mere moments after Trudeau said what he tried to say, the Internet was flooded with recent photos of the Prime Minister swilling water from plastic bottles – and it was reported that Trudeau’s family had spent $300 in a single month on water in plastic bottles. Hypocrisy, thy name is Justin.

Anyway. Will Justin Trudeau listen to all that excellent free advice? Not on your life.

Because, these days, there’s no one who personifies the phrase “single-use plastic” better than the guy who, you know, made the announcement","<div class=""articlecontent"">

When you are subject to ridicule, it really is the end. There is no way out of it. The best thing you can do is step down and let your party try to carry on. Several MPs have announced they are not running again, which means he is losing the confidence of his trained seals. Now with the Green Party going ahead of the NDP, all bets are off in terms of trying to calculate marginal seats. There are no historical data to go by in this case.

Note that so many Liberals are not running again – but not a single one has come out against Trudeau, and by extension the Liberal Party. I read this as these MP’s do not have the moral corruption that will allow them to run again for a Trudeau government. But it also means they feel that Trudeau still has a chance of winning and they don’t want to burn their Liberal bridges.

They should have asked him why he and his family consume bottled water. Is he scared of tap water? Does he not trust the quality standards of Canadian water-treatment plants?

Re: straws and autistic kids – reusable stainless steel or disposable paper straws work perfectly fine. I realize that sometimes accommodations have to be made for disabled individuals but I think in this case it’s reasonable to expect people to bring a straw from home if they absolutely MUST use one. I have poor distance vision. I don’t expect theatres to hand me a free plastic-rimmed pair of glasses every time I go see a movie.

Re: the polls – I am surprised at the resilience of the Conservative lead. In most polls, it really hasn’t shrunk at all. A consistent 4-6 points. The clock is ticking too. Pretty soon we will no longer be able to shrug off the polls with “yeah well, the election is still far off….etc…..”.

I find it intriguing that his book, interviews, etc. show how much he reveres and adores his father’s memory, but he is proving to be almost the polar opposite. Much more like…well, you know who. Even Trudeau Sr.’s adversaries acknowledged he had a steel-trap mind. Indeed, it was his intellectual arrogance and obstinacy that got him into trouble periodically. He never tried to pretend he was just an ordinary joe–his advisers had to push him to show the common touch, with decidedly mixed results. He certainly was not one to jump recklessly onto popular bandwagons or scour the country looking for new groups to apologize to. He was a bit of a gadfly on foreign policy, but he did manage to avoid publicly pissing off a succession of powerful countries. I wasn’t a big fan, but I am very sorry I never got to enjoy watching him respond to anyone accusing him of being an architect of genocide.

Second, all this talk of “suicide cult” is a bit silly. Nobody I’ve seen, heard or read thinks the Libs will lose more than 40-50 seats, which would still put them 30-40 seats ahead of where the Cons are today after the October election.

JT had “Tom Ford” sunscreen on. SPF 100. He was parade-protected from UV during the parade. By the way, he looked goofy and out of place on stage with the Raptors. Not at all G7 like. Felt kinda bad for the guy. Like he got a ticket but wasn’t invited, but went anyway.

Hi Warren, Speaking of Comms advice, who is advising Doug Ford these days? Showing up at the Raptors gig at City Hall yesterday was a big mistake, no? Surely someone in this office could have predicted that a huge crowd of Raptors fans was not a good venue? Given the polls, shouldn’t Doug be lying low and making the odd reparation to his slash & burn campaign? Sorry, but his smiling countenance is beaming down upon me from the right side of your web page as I type.

Elected, appointed, and hired modern leaders must be taught how to use the technology resources that we supply them with to work smarter.

We, the People of the World, can demonstrate how to collaborate and innovate to take constructive actions to solve the problems such as inappropriate waste management.

The link to the web-based “Everyone Counts Game Show” can be found on the Wellness Weavers website or via social media.

Instead of expecting our leaders to be perfect and have magical instant solutions to everything, we merely must train them to admit the truth and become teachable Co-leaders that use citizens & all resources correctly.

So shipping water ‘in a box’ is something our leaders need to know isn’t a solution. Thank God, we have ‘teachable Co-leaders that use citizens & all resources correctly.’ Or where we would we be now? Back to bottles? I’m guessing water balloons would be a good idea until the kids saw the display. Shipping could also be an issue . . . I’m getting real tired of stupid. I know! There’s no cure but it should be painful.

The NDP is in danger of seeing its entire Vancouver Island caucus defeated by the Greens. Most Liberal seats in BC are in the Lower Mainland, therefore less affected by the Greens. Outside of BC, the Greens are a non-factor aside from individual seats with unique circumstances (Charlottetown, for instance, on the back of the recent provincial Green breakthrough).

Oh, it’s more than that. According to 338Canada the Greens are competitive in three of the four PEI seats, and also in the New Brunswick riding of Fredericton (where the provincial leader has his seat). I live in Fredericton, the Greens have chosen a good candidate, and they have strong local organization and popular support, I wouldn’t be surprised if they pull it off this fall.

I abandoned my long time NDP loyalties when Jagmeet shocked me and went anti-pipeline. (And frankly feel betrayed after countless days of volunteering for the NDP over the years.)

When Canadians approve of TMX by a ratio of 2-1 in the latest Angus Reid data. (And a substantial larger amount when Quebec is excluded from the data.) What niche pool of voters is he trying win over, while willing to lose so many in the mainstream?

The NDP historically represented working families, now is determined under Jagmeets leadership represents anything but.

The urban elite members of the NDP decided some time ago to go chasing green votes, and basically forgot about the blue-collar, Joe Six-Pack voters (especially in rural areas) who had voted NDP for ages. You’re right that Avi and Naomi et al. represent that faction.

Interestingly, it’s not completely different from what’s happened to the Democratic Party in the US.

Another perfect example of this phenomenon is when the NDP were setting official policy on the Northern Gateway Pipeline proposal a few years ago. The building trades and other unions in Northern BC were in favour, because of the jobs. The urban greenies were opposed. Guess who won. The urban greenies basically told the building trades et al. to PFO.

The BC NDP has wrestled with this tension for the last 30 years. Harcourt tried to straddle the fence on Clayoquot Sound and got kicked from both sides. Clark at least knew where his bread was buttered and favoured his union buddies (calling Tzeporah Berman an ‘enemy of BC’ and saying protestors in the Elaho Valley who were assaulted got what they deserved). No doubt that was part of the reason large numbers of disaffected NDPers voted Green in 2001 which gave Campbell a near-shutout in the legislature.

Today, the shoe is very much on the other foot. Horgan is both desperate to appease the Greens propping up his government and prevent any further leakage of support to them, so they’ve thrown their lot in with the environmentalist camp. By demonizing resource-extraction industries, they’ve pretty much written off everything outside the Lower Mainland and the Island. (A few pockets in the West Kootenays may still vote for them.) Whether this strategy will pay off remains to be seen.

The TMX completion will provide thousands of full time middle-class employment in the Energy sector.

If your concern is tackling income inequality, than you want the pipeline.

Do not forget that the Green New Deal means displacing families. It means transferring more wealth to the top one percent.

Jagmeet abandoned working families in favour of the privileged Leapers.

1 – What I find just as interesting is the near symmetry between CPC and LPC numbers since Sept ’15. For the most part they seem to be trading back-and-forth.

2 – The Greens started to boost suddenly, around Jan ’19, without any competing parties taking a comparative loss. This suggests to me that Greens are drawing equally from other parties while also bringing new voters and previously disgruntled voters back to the electoral process.

3 – Any chance of a merger between the Greens and the NDP? Previously I would have thought it unworkable because of Big Labour and the privileged position held by unions in the NDP. However, with green technology on the rise, the NDP struggling to retain its traditional constituencies as the Greens attract many of its younger voters, and with the Green Party in Canada being more pragmatic and business-friendly than other Green parties worldwide, this might be a good time for a merger between both parties.

Fred, I know three people who voted Green in the last Ontario election, but not because they supported the policies of the Greens. Rather, they found all of the alternatives underwhelming. They viewed it as a form of protest vote. Instead of sitting at home on election day, they took the time to cast their vote, essentially for None of the Above. That the Greens and the media took this as a vote of support for the Greens was of little concern to those three individuals.

We will see what happens when the Greens are subject to the same questioning and scrutiny as the CPC, Libs, and NDP.

Thus far, most interviews I’ve seen have treated Elizabeth May with fairly gentle kid gloves. Not that she isn’t smart enough to answer intelligent questions with intelligent answers, but there is also the part of politics that involves artfully answering questions that have no good answer, and are asked purely to make you look bad.

Reporters love to feel smart, and unfortunately for some of them, they view gotcha questions as the best avenue for it. Many of the circumstances that have tripped up politicians on the campaign trail are due to these sorts of questions, and figuring out how to navigate them will be the real test of the Greens. Shouting “environment!” after every question will get old pretty quick.

Elizabeth May gets tongue-bathed by the press most of the time. That spectacle, when she was hammered out of her gourd at the PPG dinner a few years back — if any other politician from any other party had done that (with the cameras rolling, by the way), their political career would have been over, or at least seriously damaged. Lizzie got a free pass.

EKOS has a long history of over-predicting the level of Green support. So take this poll with a grain of salt, as the next several non-EKOS polls are likely to show more traditional party standings.

But there’s really no denying that the trend is there – and the risk for the NDP is substantial. All of this tells me, however, that campaigns matter. If the Greens can get support up to 15% nationally pre-writ, Greens will have a chance at electing 7-12 MPs (7 almost certainly). I absolutely expect the NDP to start eating into Green support once voters start paying more attention and are bombarded by advertising. The Green Party has never run a truly national campaign, and there doesn’t appear to be any way for the Greens to do so now, this late in the game – even if they wanted to roll the dice. I expect the Greens will focus on the 7-12 winnable ridings and that will be it.

Don’t write the NDP off – especially as voters flee the Liberal Party, which they will once Justin Trudeau becomes the subject of the most ruthless, merciless ad campaign ever unleashed against a Canadian political figure. The Ontario NDP benefited from the backlash against Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne in 2018. Singh will also benefit as Liberal support starts to slide.

Of course, all of this likely leads to a Conservative majority government. And for me, that provides yet further evidence that those to the left of the Conservatives need to get our acts together on the smaller stuff – because we are truly at risk of losing the big stuff with a majority Con government.

Of all the leaders Elizabeth May, in my view, is the most genuine and intelligent, yet as an avid environmentalist she continues to miss perhaps the greatest reversible cause of climate change; the consumption of meat.

The UN report ‘Livestock’s Long Shadow ‘ (2012) conservatively estimated that this industry was responsible for 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions (much of which are reversible) compared to only 14% from burning fossil fuels. The World Watch Institute places the livestock industry contribution closer to a more comprehensive 51%.

Yet…. neither Mrs May nor any of her adversaries has ever even acknowledged this readily addressable solution to our climate woes. Scientists estimate that if all Canadians adopted a whole plant based diet we would easily meet 50% of our Paris Accord quota by 2020!

Add to this the fact that a whole plant based no oil diet has been shown in a mountain of evidence based peer reviewed medical research over the last 40 years to prevent, halt and even reverse up to 80% of chronic diseases that are crippling our health, healthcare system and our economy it seems to me that none of these political leaders can claim to be addressing environmental, healthcare or economic issues if they refuse to even acknowledge this problem and it’s readily implantable solution.

The recent EAT -Lancet report (2019, Harvard) outlines in great detail the essential steps necessary for the planet to survive through the necessary transition to healthy planetary plant based diet. Why is no one listening?

I’m sure you feel vastly superior by pointing out that Albertans and their industries are pointless and unethical. A few facts. Earths population consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day. Subsequently, the produce a similar daily amount. Alberta is the worlds 6th largest producer and contains the worlds 3rd greatest reserves next to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. If you haven’t figured it out yet, it’s what we do and what we will continue to do despite Canada’s valiant attempt to shut us down.
It’s interesting that Washington state has the 5th largest refinery capacity in the U.S. the largest refinery is 3 miles south of the B.C. border. Have you been to Salt Spring Island and Anacortes Island in Wa. Same island chain and they do have on thing in common. They do not have one single refinery. Salt Spring Island has none. Anacortes Island has 2. Thousands of tankers serve the Wa. refineries each year. Receiving crude from AK and distributing refined products to OR. And CA. Nary a protester.
For 10 years Albertans have heard Canadians disparage us unmercifully based on false information provided primarily by the Unifor media and the CBC. If you didn’t notice, we’re not going to accept it any longer. So one way or the other, we will within the next few years be a U.S. state. That inevitably however is a major plus for Canada. You will meet your Paris Agreement commitments with little effort. Rather than being a county that contains 65% far left, further left and marxists, you will be 75%. No opposition. Let’s be fair. We want you to be who you are. Albertans want to be who they are. Your comments should include a proposal that it’s time to dismiss Alberta from Canada. They are obviously not worthy and we agree completely.

323,Warren Kinsella,"My latest in the Sun: when they came for the Jews/Sikhs/Muslims, they said nothing",2019-06-24 13:29:00,Warren,,"Silence.

That’s all that could be heard from the federal party leaders, essentially: silence, or something approaching that.

The occasion: the decision of assorted Quebec politicians to pass a law telling religious people what they can wear. Jews, Sikhs, but mainly Muslims.

The law, formerly called Bill 21, was passed last weekend in a special sitting of the so-called National Assembly. It makes it illegal to wear religious symbols at work if you’re a teacher, a bus driver, a cop, a nurse, or even a day care worker. It applies to everyone who gets a stipend from the province, basically.

The law is illegal. It is wildly unconstitutional, for all the reasons you’d expect: it stomps all over freedom of speech, freedom of religion and equality rights. It giddily shreds the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The law is against the law. So, Quebec’s ruling class – who have never been particularly fussy about Jews, Sikhs or Muslims, truth be told – also stipulated that their law would operate “notwithstanding” the Charter.

In Quebec, now, you’ve theoretically got freedom of speech and religion. Except, say, when the chauvinists in the National Assembly say you don’t.

Stick that yarmulke in your pocket, Jew. Remove that turban your faith requires you to wear, Sikh. Put it away.

As history has shown us, freedoms rarely get swept away with dramatic decrees. Instead, we lose freedoms by degrees. In bits and pieces. Fascism typically slips into our lives without a sound, like a snake slithering into the kitchen, unseen.

This week, the snake curled around the ankles of Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh. All of them pretended that the snake was not there.

Justin Trudeau, in his teeny-tiniest mouse voice, suggested that no one should “tell a woman what she can and cannot wear.” That’s all we got from him, pretty much.

Andrew Scheer, for his part, said he “would never present a bill like that at the federal level.” But, he hastily added, he would also leave the whole messy business to the “elected members in Quebec.”

Jagmeet Singh, who now couldn’t get a provincial job in Quebec because he wears a turban himself, said this about the law when it was tabled: “I think it’s hurtful, because I remember what it’s like to grow up and not feel like I belong.”

Words.

But action? Actually, you know, doing something to protect minority rights and religious freedoms in Quebec?

Not on your life. It’s an election year, pal.

During one of the many, many debates Quebec has had about this legislated intolerance – when controversy was raging about the then-Liberal government’s bill that would force women to remove veils when, say, getting on a city bus – Francois Legault, then an Opposition leader, was asked about the crucifix hanging in the National Assembly.

It should stay, he said. “We have a Christian heritage in Quebec,” he said. “I don’t see any problem keeping it.”

That’s when Francois Legault’s veil slipped, as it were. That’s when we got to see who he really represents.

At his very first press conference after the Quebec election, Legault dispensed with any notion that he would be the Premier to all. To the Muslims (with their headscarves), and the Jews (with their kippahs), and the Hindus (with their markings on their faces), Legault’s message was plain: I don’t represent you. I don’t care about you. You are lower-class.

And, now, from our federal leaders: a shrug. Indifference.

Jesus, from that spot He long had above the National Assembly, is (as always) needed. Right about now, Jesus could remind our politicians, federal and provincial, what he said in Matthew 23:3. You know:

Actually the law applies to Christians as well, but that not mentioned. Christians are not an accepted victims group in Canada. You would assume from this article that religious symbols were banned completely. The true is these people are free to wear all the religious symbols they want in their personal lives. When I’m dealing with a government official I don’t want to be concerned about their religious proclivities. They represent the government. Many occupations have a dress code. That’s all this is. The Quebec government was wise to invoke the “not withstanding clause” so this isn’t dragged through the courts. This shouldn’t be decided by
un-elected, lefty activist judges.

Speaking as a conservative (and Conservative), I believe that arguments based upon the Charter of Rights and Freedoms aside, Sikhs have more than earned the right of wearing their turbans in public and as public officials.

It is the same turban they wore in service to Canada during the First and Second World Wars, where they proved to be among the most loyal of soldiers to King and Country.

I also don’t have any issue with Jews, Muslims, Christians, or First Nations, or any other folks wearing traditional religious or cultural garb while in public.

I have mixed feelings about this. I don’t care what someone wears on their head, but i think faces should be uncovered. If it is illegal to ask someone their religion as a job applicant, should it be legal to promote your religion in a public sector job?
If the entire federal Liberal party is willing to exclude people from public life or public funding due to their religious beliefs on abortion, is this not just another step?

It’s easy to explain, each party worries coming out too strongly against this would hurt them in Quebec

Trudeau: With expected seat losses in English Canada, he absolutely must gain seats in Quebec if he wants to remain PM and that means appealing to some of the 45% or so who would vote CAQ if an election were held today.

Conservatives: With Doug Ford hurting the Tories in Ontario, there are not enough winneable seats in English Canada to win a majority on their own like Harper did in 2011. And no majority, Scheer doesn’t become PM as NDP and Greens will back Liberals. And to win in Quebec, he needs to appeal to those who voted CAQ or would vote CAQ today.

NDP: They are not going to form government and will likely lose seats, but if they get a goose egg in Quebec, that could really hurt their rebuilding for the next election so they need to at least try to hold a few of the 16 seats they have in Quebec and a lot of the NDP voters that voted for Layton in 2011 also voted for Legault in 2018.

So does that justify the stance of the federal leaders? No, but as they say everything is politics. I can assure you if Kenney or Ford tried this, Trudeau would all over them as he knows he won’t win any seats in Alberta so nothing to lose and in Ontario all potential Liberal voters either didn’t vote for Doug Ford or if they did, they regret their vote. Anyone who still supports Doug Ford won’t consider voting Liberal.

Besides not sure if Chretien did this, but I know Martin on health care was hypocritical. Whenever Ralph Klein even entertained allowing more private health care he threatened to hit Alberta with big fines under Canada Health Act, but when Quebec had much more blatant violations turned a blind eye so this is something we’ve seen far too many politicians do even though it is not right.

There are consequences for inaction.

Quebec may be the spoiled child of our confederacy, but parliamentary ridings across the country are made up of the very people this would affect and passive tolerance of psuedo-nationalism for a handful of seats in Quebec isn’t going play well in key battle grounds.

No major party can afford to turn a blind eye to this shit and expect to go to voters in Ontario and BC with the reasoning that they don’t want to “be too strong on the issue”.

You’re either for this, or against it. There’s no middle ground, and politics very much requires you to stake a position.

You need not look further than Tom Mulcair in 2015 and his party’s apparent struggle with the burqa debate.

I hope you correct this: “It makes it illegal to wear religious symbols at work if you’re a teacher, a bus driver, a cop, a nurse, or even a day care worker. It applies to everyone who gets a stipend from the province, basically.”

I does not apply to bus drivers, nurses or day care workers. It’s quite an important distinction.

“The new secularism law, once known as Bill 21, makes it illegal to wear religious symbols at work if you’re a public school teacher, a police officer, a judge, a prison guard, a wildlife officer, a Crown prosecutor or if you work as a lawyer for the government.”

Trudeau is the PM and Liberals loudly proclaim they are the party of PET’s Charter. Not excusing other leaders but the responsibility to challenge this is on JT and his government.
However, they are already losing in rural Quebec thanks to their immigration and Illegals’ policies. There’s not a chance in hell Trudeau will risk losing more ground in the Quebecois boonies over a matter of principle.

317,Warren Kinsella,My latest: dogs and politicos,2019-06-26 15:13:00,Warren,,"Why do political people love dogs?

Because we do, we do. Proof is at hand.

MacKenzie King’s personal legacy – characterized, as it was, by his avid spiritualism, his byzantine diaries, and his nighttime strolls down certain streets the Market – is not without controversy. A debate rages, even now, about whether Canada’s longest-serving Prime Minister was a political genius or a certifiable nut job.

But about one part of King’s private life there can be no dispute: his love of his three Irish Terriers, all of whom he named Pat.

Pat, Pat and Pat. (Among other things, it reduces monogramming costs.)

Alliteratively, King called the Irish Terriers “red, racy and rectangular,” and they sort of were. King, being a man who was always distant from his fellow man (and woman, except for those ones he ran into in the Market at night), was closest to Pat. The dog went everywhere with him. He trusted it more than he trusted any human, save and except his beloved mother. (Who, along with the departed Pats, he attempted to commune with in seances.)

Here is what he write in his diaries about the Pats. It is something that any politico could write about their dog, too.

“[Pat is] a God-sent little angel in the guise of a dog, my dear little saviour,” King wrote. “[He is perfect because he] asks only to be near your and to share in a companionship of pure trust.”

And that is why every political dog is beloved by their political human: trust. They listen, they do not talk back, and they keep secrets secret.

After taking office in 1957, Dief the Chief ordered his staff to come up with a name for the dog he was given by a fan. He wanted to call it “Tory,” but his staff were worried that the pup would become fodder for editorial cartoonists. So he was named Happy instead.

Like King, whom he deeply despised, Dief was singularly unimaginative about dog names. Thus, there was more than one Diefenbaker dog named Happy. Happy the Second was not a terrier, but he was a terror, often disappearing from the Conservative leader’s office. Dief’s driver would then be dispatched to find Happy II, and he always did. “My dog has the ancestry and the distinguished pedigree, but no training at all,” said Canada’s thirteenth Prime Minister, who could have been also describing Canada’s twenty-third Prime Minister.

Stephen Harper was a big fan of cats, by the way, which tells you all that you need to know. He also had a chinchilla named Charlie, which is partially redeeming, but not entirely.

Did Pierre Trudeau like dogs? Did he have one? Was he almost certainly a cat person, like that Harper fellow? History does not record the truth. His son Justin, however, has a Portuguese water dog, who is neither Portgguese nor made of water. His name is Kenzie.

When he arrived at the Prime Ministerial homestead in 2016, that hard-ass hard-news outlet, The Huffington Post, headlined the resulting story: “Justin Trudeau Dog: The Prime Minister’s Family Got Even Cuter! Meet the prime minister’s newest family member!”

In a tough and unforgiving report, the HuffPo wrote: “Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke some very big news for his family: they got a puppy! Along with an adorable photo of two-year-old Hadrien playing with the new dog, Trudeau tweeted: “#tbt to the little one meeting our newest arrival a few months ago. Say hello to Kenzie.”

Kenzie, we note, hasn’t been much seen in public since 2016. In this way, he is like electoral reform, a balanced budget, federal-provincial harmony, and reconciliation with indigenous peoples.

Why all this talk about politicos and dogs, you ask? Simple: one of mine – the beautiful, sweet and perfect Daisy, after whom I named my company – slipped away last week. I have been shattered ever since. I miss that dog, a lot.

Why do we political types love them so? Because, as King, and Dief, and others knew too well, politics is a business you do not enter to make friends. It is nasty, brutish and usually shorter than expected.

But at the end of a long day of treachery and back-stabbing, nothing repairs the political heart better than those brown eyes, and that wet nose, asking for nothing but love.

Rest easy, Daisy. Meet your new friends, Pat and Happy and all the others.

I have a book by some well known southern US lawyer (altho I forget his name now) about ‘Winning Any Argument’ (or something similar). He quite eloquently described the unremitting love of a dog. Never judging, always loving. I’m also reminded of an old joke: If you lock your wife and dog in the trunk of your car, in 3 or 4 hours one of them will be happy to see you. I’m guessing that ‘joke’ may not be appropriate. Still applies though when talking about man’s – sorry – people’s, best friend. ALWAYS happy to see you.

That dope Scheer stood up and said Trudeau should have sorted out the China problem while at Osaka, as if it were just matter of threatening them. They’ve been giving us the cold shoulder – so what’s Scheer’s plan? Blah, blah, blah, squawk, I would have done better, I would have threatened them, I’m a big strong leader, blah, blah, blah. That’s the whole plan. Like his environmental plan tat – a great big fat nothing. A zero.

All Cons know how to do is to lower taxes for the rich so that government revenues fall, then we must have austerity because we don’t have enough money. Fire those civil servants – we can’t afford them! The rich get richer and the Cons con. The people get screwed and live on wildfire smoke and elite horse manure fed us out of “Non-Profit Institutes”, where “scholars” labour at producing intellectual nonsense for the benefit of the rich who fund them.

I’ve seen zero sign that Scheer could organize his way out of a wet paper bag! Or even tear apart mounds of wet sphagetti with his bare hands. Any dolt can stand up and say he could have done better, and Sheer’s a fine dolt fom all indications. Make Rempel Foreign Minister and she could yell, scream and stamp her feet and have an excellent rant about Commies. That’ll work on the Chinese every time.

Yes, Scheer, without having ever been in charge of anything more than the parliamentary cafeteria and being a useless Speaker of the House, apparently in his daydreams has amazing powers on the international stage where he will trample those darn 1.4 billion Chicoms like swatting a fly. All big mouth, no trousers. Totally unconvincing. Scheer would crumple at the first sign of any retaliatory threats because he’s unable to think on his feet. You just have to see him in interviews repeating rote answers. Flexible the man is not.

And at home, if the Cons get in, we’ll get a Ford Train Wreck style government, as Andrew Coyne calls that lout’s “performance”, just for the entire country instead. Where MPs stand up or sit down like puppets and cheer at every stupid thing their leader says as if it were Italy in the 1930s, and crony nepotism reigns supreme.

I am intensely unhappy at the way our country is going. So, this blog owner’s predilections notwithstanding, I’d take Trudeau over Scheer every single time. There’s poor performance but a real Canadian – that much is clear, and then there’s a dull market-agenda-driven parochial dunce from the Prairies. Easy choice out of two uninspiring candidates.

That was well planned in advanced! He did nothing for the seniors or our Vet soldiers! He wanted to take away the diabetic supplement! He is promoting drugs!

When people ask me why I won’t vote CPC, I always give them the following: I have my view of Canada. It doesn’t even remotely resemble the Western view or the Alberta view. So, my view is equally respectable as other views. My view is no better or worse than other people’s view. But in my case, I simply can’t and won’t vote CPC as long as it does not, within limits, reasonably reflect my view of Canada. That may be right or wrong but at least it’s fair.

That’s all that the first Adlai Stevenson left behind in the sands of time, pretty much. He was the 23rd vice-president of the United States, he was from Illinois, and he was a Democrat. His grandson was the Democratic Party’s candidate for president a couple of times, in the 50s. But old Uncle Adlai, as he was called? He was just remembered for his aphorisms, pretty much.

That one above, the one about political hypocrisy, should be printed out, laminated, and pinned to Justin Trudeau’s shirt (You know, like parents do with kids who might wander away during field trips to the zoo).

Trudeau’s PMO staff, too, should have Adlai Stevenson’s pithy maxim tattooed to their foreheads, so that they remember the cardinal rule when they are at their next “deliverology” meeting: In politics, you can get away with all manner of misdeeds and sins. But hypocrisy? Political hypocrisy is lethal. It is toxic. It is the scarlet letter.

To wit: Justin Trudeau and his PMO are hypocrites. There is no shortage of evidence.

This week, for example, Prime Minister Selfie tweeted out a nice photo of himself with something called the “Papineau Youth Council,” whatever that is. Fresh-faced youngsters ringed a table listening to Trudeau talk about, as he put it, ways “to fight climate change.” That’s a quote.

Eyeballing the taxpayer-subsidized snapshot, we see:
• Pizza (not weird, it’s a political backroom staple)

• Trudeau’s pizza slices, both flipped over (super weird)

• None of the kids smiling, not even a bit (also weird, but who can blame them, really)

• Right in the foreground, a pile of plastic cutlery (weird AND wildly hypocritical)

Plastic cutlery? That’s weird – because, really, who uses cutlery to eat pizza?

And it’s hypocritical, too, because this is the selfsame Prime Minister, boys and girls, who just a few days ago said he planned to ban so-called single-use plastics. Like, um, plastic cutlery. He also said his family uses “like, drink box water bottles sort of things,” and none of us know what that means. Still.

Political graveyards are littered with the remains of political hypocrites. Pat Buchanan, for example. As I write in my must-have book, The War Room, when he was making one of his many quixotic runs at the presidency, Buchanan started promoting the Trumpist “America First” tagline everywhere. Hire only Americans, buy only American.

So the advisors to George H. W. Bush discovered a key factoid about Buchanan’s “America First” private life: he personally drove a Mercedes, made in far-away Germany. They passed along that little revelation out to the media hordes, and that was the end of Pat.

Another example: Democrat Gary Hart. Back in 1987, when the family-friendly Senator was making his second run at the top job, rumours were rampant he was following his little soldier into battle a bit too frequently. Gary was indignant about this scurrilous assault on his personal life. Said he: “Follow me around. I don’t care. They’ll be bored.”

The media followed him around. They weren’t bored. Gary – thereafter photographed with model Donna Rice balanced on his senatorial knee, on a yacht called (we kid you not) Monkey Business – ended up caring, quite a bit. And that was the end of Gary.

Have Justin Trudeau’s well-documented hypocrisies similarly doomed him to defeat in October? The polls suggest the best the Liberal leader can hope for is a minority government. If that.

So, if Trudeau loses, LavScam, unbalanced budgets, the Aga Khan and decidedly unharmonious fed-prov relations will figure prominently as causes.

But one politically-fatal word, above all the others, will be seen on Justin Trudeau’s headstone:

<p>The media followed him around. They weren’t bored.&nbsp; Gary – thereafter photographed with model Donna Rice balanced on his senatorial knee, on a yacht called (we kid you not)&nbsp;<em>Monkey Business</em>&nbsp;– ended up caring, quite a bit.&nbsp; And that was the end of Gary.</p>
<p>Have Justin Trudeau’s well-documented hypocrisies similarly doomed him to defeat in October? The polls suggest the best the Liberal leader can hope for is a minority government. If that.</p>
<p>So, if Trudeau loses, LavScam, unbalanced budgets, the Aga Khan and decidedly unharmonious fed-prov relations will figure prominently as causes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But one politically-fatal word, above all the others, will be seen on Justin Trudeau’s headstone:</p>

Justin Trudeau spends $70 Billion on dubious green plans BEFORE doing the cost-benefit and environmental impact analysis to determine if the money is being wasted…

The head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo is chairing an arm of a new independent watchdog that will hold Ottawa to account on its climate change commitments and policies.

Blair Feltmate said in an interview that the new institute, which is being called the Pan-Canadian Expert Collaboration, will help Canadians see if their federal government is making decisions in their best interests when it comes to tackling global warming.

The details of how the funding will be transferred to the group, and on what schedule, are still being finalized.

Feltmate said the group’s objective will be to start from the “goals and the aspirations” of the Trudeau government’s climate plan, the Pan-Canadian Framework, and “apply the intellectual framework to execute on that commitment.”

“How do we actually proceed to put an optimal price on carbon, to minimize carbon emissions? How do we proceed to embrace energy efficiency and renewable power, electricity storage? How do we proceed on those fronts, in a manner that will collectively benefit the country well?”

Close to half of Canadian program touted for electric cars is funding natural gas stations
https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/01/25/news/close-half-canadian-program-touted-electric-cars-funding-natural-gas-stations

The program has been promoted as fulfilling a commitment to put more zero-emission vehicles on the road. Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna recently touted the program as part of her announcement on new EV chargers across Quebec.

What is less known, is that this program has also funded the installation of seven natural gas refueling stations, and three hydrogen refueling stations.

While there are far fewer natural gas and hydrogen stations than EV chargers, the refueling stations cost much more to install, typically $1 million each, compared to $50,000 for an EV charger — meaning they are sucking up much more program funding per station.

A National Observer analysis shows that, as of Jan. 25, a list of projects being funded under the program for which contribution agreements have been signed showed $6,502,000 had been given out for natural gas refuelling, compared to $7,967,000 for EV charging and hydrogen refueling. This would mean that the government has spent 44.9 per cent of the total program funding on natural gas stations.

Being labelled a hypocrite is usually fatal. But a PM should only go down for quite deliberate country-unmaking mistakes where ethics and the integrity of government are willingly compromised: read Norman and SNC Lavelin.

Some of us will also never accept kicking JWR and JP out of caucus. But that’s his choice, an enormous political blunder that rubbed countless potential voters the wrong way, hence current polling results.

Personally, I see us now venturing into the equally dangerous territory of petty, political overkill. I don’t give a shit about the PYC, or pizza delivered with plastic cutlery. Sure, boxed bottled water used personally by Trudeau and his family is another matter — but going down this dubious route won’t wear well with a lot of Canadians, already predisposed to give the Liberals the heave-ho.

Canadians like their political attacks substantive and well-founded. Anything else only plays right into the hands of the person being attacked. Canada isn’t the States. That’s how Trudeau made it into power in the first place.

Trudeau hints to the media that he has leaned on Trump to help out with Canada’s woes with China in the upcoming G20.

But just before the G20, he disrespected him saying Canada will adopt California’s auto emission standards.

These are the same emission standards that Trump administration is battling as illegal, at a time when the Auto industry wrote an open letter to California and the Trump administration to resolve this issue as the cost to satisfy multiple jurisdictions is too costly.

You can’t ask someone to help you out, than try and complicate their internal matters.

Warren:
First off, I can appreciate that the incident between Justin and the Aga Khan was not appropriate. However, I do appreciate what the Aga Khan has done to promote multiculturalism and multi-faith dialogue within Islam, within Canada, as well as within the wider international community. So I kinda wince whenever he is brought up in association with Justin Trudeau in political discussion.

Also, I agree with the bulk of the remainder of the article. With the exception of your bullet points up top, where I must take issue with the following:
Eyeballing the taxpayer-subsidized snapshot, we see:
“Trudeau’s pizza slices, both flipped over (super weird)”

I’ve seen this frequently in Canada outside of Toronto and the GTA. It’s not common, but it’s not so uncommon as to be weird.

“Plastic cutlery? That’s weird – because, really, who uses cutlery to eat pizza?”

Eating pizza with cutlery isn’t weird. Especially pizza from fine Italian establishments. I do it in certain pizza establishments.

What makes it weird is the following:
1 – The cutlery is plastic.

2 – That Monsieur Trudeau has the pizza flipped over suggests this is working/middle class pizza you order delivered to your home on a Saturday night while having a movie night with the kids, and not the type of fine dining pizza one orders out on a date night with one’s spouse after attending the opera.

Basically your old Tim Horton’s vs Starbucks coffee analogy.

NANOS: certainly good news for this PM. No doubt that Trudeau is moving his personal numbers. Which brings me to two observations: how much of the uptick is due to the Ford government and how much due to Justin Trudeau personally?

It’s my guess that the latter will pay far greater political dividends for the Liberals if Trudeau has really turned around his personal numbers. It’s my hunch that growing Liberals numbers simply based on a bumbling provincial government will not generate as much long lasting political mileage for the PM and his party.

But no doubt about it, this, even though it’s only one poll, is incredibly significant for the Liberals. It may very well be the break in the Conservative dam that could potentially snatch victory out of the CPC’s hand if this trend continues — and is also reflected to some significant extent in the other polling companies’ numbers.

If I’m a Liberal strategist today, I’m happier than a pig in shit looking at these latest NANOS results.

I know you already know this, Ronald, but Canada just isn’t a naturally conservative country.

I’m 100% with you on the VA Norman thing, though. That issue isn’t nearly over with, and it’s only a matter of time until someone leaks a dollar figure and the reporters start asking if it’s correct (and Junior, of course, will nether confirm *nor*deny, which is all the answer we really need…).

I can’t leave out advice for Scheer: I would hit on Norman, above and beyond the normal rotation of taking on the government, each and every single day between now and election day.

I would ask why in the name of transparency is the Norman settlement confidential? Why are the parties contractually obliged to remain silent? What’s in there that the government doesn’t want Canadians to know? Will Trudeau agree to make public the terms of settlement so Canadians can judge for themselves what went down and how?

312,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: amend the constitution, save the planet",2019-07-04 12:59:00,Warren,,"Want to save the planet? Amend the Constitution.

In the United States, such an amendment has been sought since 1996. Here’s what it says: “The natural resources of the nation are the heritage of present and future generations. The right of each person to clean and healthful air and water, and to the protection of the other natural resources of the nation, shall not be abridged by any person.”

That sort of statement exists in the state constitutions in Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Montana. But it hasn’t happened yet at the U.S. federal level.

Same in Canada. In our constitutional rights document, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, there are all manner of protections. Section two says that all Canadians have the fundamental freedoms of conscience, religion, thought, belief, opinion, expression and “freedom of the press and other media of communication.” It also declares that peaceable assembly and association are fundamental freedoms.

Sections three, four and five proclaim and protect democratic rights. Six gives us mobility rights within Canada, and the right to a livelihood. Section seven asserts our right to “life, liberty and security of the person.” Eight protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures; nine protects us against arbitrary detention or imprisonment. Ten to 14 describe our rights when we are arrested or facing trial.

And section 15, importantly, constitutionalizes the notion that Canadians have “the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination” – meaning no discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. There are quite a few sections about language rights after that. Section 25: aboriginal rights. Section 27: multiculturalism. Section 28: gender equality.

But nothing – nothing – about the environment. When you consider, say, that mobility rights don’t matter so much when your part of Canada is on fire, or under water, that’s a critical lapse. When there’s no air left to breathe, equality rights tend to take a back seat.

It can be argued, and has been, that section seven’s “life, liberty and security of the person” includes the environment. In about 20 countries around the world, in fact, constitutional court challenges are presently taking place, in which plaintiffs are arguing that life, liberty and personal security are being infringed by inadequate, or non-existent, environmental protections.

Last November in Quebec, a group called Environnment Jeunesse started a class action in Quebec Superior Court, seeking $340 million in damages – $100 per young person in the class. The young Quebecois are arguing that the section seven rights of young Canadians were being violated because the federal government hasn’t done enough about climate change.

Because, you know, it hasn’t.

The Justin Trudeau government talks a good environmental game, of course. With much fanfare, it recently insisted that it will ban single-use plastics. And then, just a few days later, Trudeau is photographed by his own office – In Quebec! At a lunch with a group of young people, the aforementioned plaintiffs! – sitting at a conference table where plastic cutlery was in plain view.

The Conservatives have an environmental plan, too, but it has been attacked by its former leader, Kim Campbell. The New Democrats have tabled something called “Power to Change: A new deal for climate action and good jobs.” It says it’ll meet its targets before other parties say they’ll meet theirs. But everyone knows the federal NDP will be unlikely to form government anytime soon.

The Green Party, as its very name suggests, is arguably the most serious about avoiding environmental calamity. That is partly why Elizabeth May’s party has rocketed ahead of the NDP to take third place in recent polls – and why liberals and Liberals (like this writer) have donated to them, and plan to vote and work for them.

The Green Party’s environmental plan is the one that deserves the greatest scrutiny, because – if, as recent polls also suggest, a minority government is almost inevitable – it is the one now most likely to be implemented. Elizabeth May will be the most powerful person in Canada, in effect, because she will hold the balance of power in late 2019 and beyond.

May’s plan calls for modernizing the national electricity grid; creating trades jobs by retrofitting every building in Canada; ending all imports of foreign oil, and using only Canadian fossil fuels; and pushing adaptation measures to protect agriculture, fishing and forestry from climate change. It’s not bad.

To achieve it, or part of it, more than a minority Parliament is needed. We also need a national consensus, one that can’t be diluted by lobbyists, self-interest, and the vagaries of election results. If recent events have shown us anything, it is that there is a paradox at the epicentre of Canadian politics: we all care about the environment, but we all lack the means or the will to do something meaningful about it.

The Constitution, as Environnment Jeunesse has already figured out, is the way to address that. If we are serious about saving our part of the planet – and polls suggests that an overwhelming majority of Canadians, from cost to rising coast, are – then let’s constitutionalize our collective desire.

<p>That sort of statement exists in the state constitutions in Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Montana.&nbsp; But it hasn’t happened yet at the U.S. federal level.</p>
<p>Same in Canada.&nbsp; In our constitutional rights document, the&nbsp;<em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, there are all manner of protections.&nbsp; Section two says that all Canadians have the fundamental freedoms of conscience, religion, thought, belief, opinion, expression and&nbsp;“freedom of the press and other media of communication.”&nbsp; It also declares that peaceable assembly and association are fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>Sections three, four and five proclaim and protect democratic rights.&nbsp; Six gives us mobility rights within Canada, and the right to a livelihood.&nbsp; Section seven asserts our right to “life, liberty and security of the person.”&nbsp; Eight protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures; nine protects us against arbitrary detention or imprisonment.&nbsp; Ten to 14 describe our rights when we are arrested or facing trial.</p>
<p>And section 15, importantly, constitutionalizes the notion that Canadians have “the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination” – meaning no discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.&nbsp; There are quite a few sections about language rights after that.&nbsp; Section 25: aboriginal rights.&nbsp; Section 27: multiculturalism.&nbsp; Section 28: gender equality.</p>
<p>But nothing –&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>– about the environment.&nbsp; When you consider, say, that mobility rights don’t matter so much when your part of Canada is on fire, or under water, that’s a critical lapse.&nbsp; When there’s no air left to breathe, equality rights tend to take a back seat.</p>
<p>It can be argued, and has been, that section seven’s “life, liberty and security of the person” includes the environment.&nbsp; In about 20 countries around the world, in fact, constitutional court challenges are presently taking place, in which plaintiffs are arguing that life, liberty and personal security are being infringed by inadequate, or non-existent, environmental protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last November in Quebec, a group called&nbsp;<em>Environnment Jeunesse</em>&nbsp;started a class action in Quebec Superior Court, seeking $340 million in damages – $100 per young person in the class.&nbsp; The young Quebecois are arguing that the section seven rights of young Canadians were being violated because the federal government hasn’t done enough about climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because, you know, it hasn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Justin Trudeau government talks a good environmental game, of course.&nbsp; With much fanfare, it recently insisted that it will ban single-use plastics.&nbsp; And then, just a few days later, Trudeau is photographed by his own office – In Quebec! At a lunch with a group of young people, the aforementioned plaintiffs! – sitting at a conference table where plastic cutlery was in plain view.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have an environmental plan, too, but it has been attacked by its former leader, Kim Campbell.&nbsp; The New Democrats have tabled something called “Power to Change: A new deal for climate action and good jobs.”&nbsp; It says it’ll meet its targets before other parties say they’ll meet theirs.&nbsp; But everyone knows the federal NDP will be unlikely to form government anytime soon.</p>
<p>The Green Party, as its very name suggests, is arguably the most serious about avoiding environmental calamity.&nbsp; That is partly why Elizabeth May’s party has rocketed ahead of the NDP to take third place in recent polls – and why liberals and Liberals (like this writer) have donated to them, and plan to vote and work for them.</p>
<p>The Green Party’s environmental plan is the one that deserves the greatest scrutiny, because – if, as recent polls also suggest, a minority government is almost inevitable – it is the one now most likely to be implemented.&nbsp; Elizabeth May will be the most powerful person in Canada, in effect, because she will hold the balance of power in late 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p>May’s plan calls for modernizing the national electricity grid; creating trades jobs by retrofitting every building in Canada; ending all imports of foreign oil, and using only Canadian fossil fuels; and pushing adaptation measures to protect agriculture, fishing and forestry from climate change.&nbsp; It’s not bad.</p>
<p>To achieve it, or part of it, more than a minority Parliament is needed.&nbsp; We also need a national consensus, one that can’t be diluted by lobbyists, self-interest, and the vagaries of election results.&nbsp; If recent events have shown us anything, it is that there is a paradox at the epicentre of Canadian politics: we all care about the environment, but we all lack the means or the will to do something meaningful about it.</p>
<p>The Constitution, as&nbsp;<em>Environnment Jeunesse</em>&nbsp;has already figured out, is the way to address that.&nbsp; If we are serious about saving our part of the planet – and polls suggests that an overwhelming majority of Canadians, from cost to rising coast, are – then let’s constitutionalize our collective desire.</p>
<p>Every other right and freedom is protected in there.&nbsp; Why not the right to an environment, too?</p>

In a perverse way, one almost hopes Michigan’s new Democratic governor is successfull in shutting down Enbridge’s Line 5, hopefully before the federal election, which would shutdown all the refineries in Sarnia, and leave Ontario and Quebec desperately short of gasoline and diesel for the foreseeable future.

I personally wish environmental protesters would blockade roads, highways and gas stations. That way, at least we would have a very honest and direct political dialogue about this. Pipelines are essentially abstract, and therefore are this easy political target for environmentalists. If you’re a truly committed environmentalist and not a hypocrite, why aren’t you shutting down gas stations?

Hi Warren,

Environment is, to me, a weasel word, a euphemism. Nature is the word that should be used.

I look at the pictures NASA shares of outer space, and I see nature, not the supernatural. I don’t think working around the edges and using euphemisms in the face of an existential survival threat has been worth a damn in the big picture.

Humanity emanates from nature, not the other way around. Anyone who believes otherwise is unfit for office.

Keep up the good fight!

All that will be achieved by putting environmental language in the Constitution is the enrichment of the legal profession for decades to come. Everyone with an environmental ax to grind, no matter how bizarre or far-flung, will lean on this new provision to launch a lawsuit, or mount a constitutional challenge to existing laws.

The courts have proven, over many years, that they often discard logic and merit in favor of abstract interpretations of the Charter and the Constitution, because it serves their personal political viewpoint. We don’t need another reason for the courts to get clogged up with fringe lawsuits that are more about increasing prominence for certain lobby groups than actually helping the environment or the country as a whole.

Wondering, how long it will be before Ford gets “Patrick Browned”? Have to believe that Conservatives, at the federal and provincial levels, will be chompin’ at the bit to get rid of the Ontario Premier, who’s killing the Conservative brand in the province. With Ford around, PMJT has a strong chance to clean-up again in Ontario, and hold onto power.

The problem starts with people lumping one party in with another. PCs aren’t supposed to be CPCs and vice-versa. But Ford has foolishly moved his party a-bridge-too-far to the right and that may kill CPC momentum in the province.

310,Warren Kinsella,"Yell at the spouse, lose the house (updated",2019-07-06 08:40:00,Warren,,"That’s a headline that ran in the Sun, nearly a generation ago. It changed political history.

Remember Lyn McLeod? I do. McLeod was the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party in the mid-1990s. In the months leading up to the 1995 election, McLeod had a massive lead in every opinion poll. NDP Premier Bob Rae’s government was despised; P.C. leader Mike Harris was mostly unknown.

One fateful day, McLeod talked to a reporter on proposed legislation that would change the definition of domestic violence – and the penalties for it.

One penalty for abusing one’s spouse, she said, should be the abuser’s eviction from the family home. Hard to argue with that, perhaps.

But then the reporter asked McLeod if domestic violence included “verbal abuse.” It did, she said. Yes.

The next day, the headline in the Toronto Sun was this: “Shout at spouse, lose your house.”

Almost immediately, the Ontario Liberals started to slide in the polls. Mike Harris would go on to win a big majority. And a close friend, and a senior advisor to McLeod, later told me: “Yell at the spouse, lose the house,” he said. “That’s why we lost.”

Which brings us to this, the former Bill C-46:






The law that destroyed the Ontario Liberals was aproposed law. This one now is law.

Lawyers like me have been warning, for months, that this change is wildly unconstitutional. It’s legislative overreach. And it’s a political suicide note, too.

But it’s the law of the land. It gives police the power to demand you submit to a breathalyzer, even they don’t have a reasonable suspicion you’re impaired. Even if you aren’t behind the wheel.

When this change was being considered, legal experts warned that a Canadian who drives home, sober, and then consumes some alcohol could register a fail on the breathalyzer – even though they didn’t drive while drunk. And that’s in fact what happened to a B.C. woman: she was by the pool at her sister’s place, having a drink, when the RCMP arrived and demanded a breath sample.

She lost her licence and her vehicle. Ultimately, she defeated the impairment charge on a technicality – but not before spending thousands on legal fees.

The media are already calling this a “police state” law. That it’s “an inexcusable violation of an individual’s Charter rights, and an invitation to police harassment of visible minorities“. Hell, even the CBC is calling it “unnecessary police power.”

Make no mistake: this issue – coming in the Summer before an election – is potentially lethal for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, I am told, are now preparing to do to Trudeau what Mike Harris and a Toronto Sun headline did to Lyn McLeod.

“Have a drink, wind up in the clink”: may not be as deadly as that long-ago Sun headline. But it may do the trick.

UPDATE: Oh, look. Shortly after the above post went up, something interesting happened. I’d say they are nervous, wouldn’t you?

The provinces haven’t decriminalized Impaired driving.

It’s still a criminal offence and falls under federal jurisdiction. They have no power to suspend your license until the crown proves -beyond a reasonable doubt – you’re guilty of driving impaired ( or over .80).

However the provinces have jurisdiction over roads and drivers licenses. They have introduced “administrative suspensions” where they can suspend your DL for 90 days ( and longer if you don’t install a blow box in your ignition) and impound your car for a spell. The suspension is immediate and there is no need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt . You can appeal to an administrative body but the onus is on you.

The provinces are not punishing you for criminal behaviour but rather for, essentially, violating the terms of you license by being unsafe on the road.

Educate yourself – read the link.

Specifically: “No. Mandatory Alcohol Screening (MAS) can only be used if the driver is operating a vehicle, the vehicle has been lawfully stopped, and if the police officer has the approved screening device at hand. It does not apply when drivers have returned home or arrived at their destination.”

The 2 hour rule is intended to close some sketchy loop holes in the drunk driving laws.

If you can’t be bothered to read the link I provided, here are some relevant passages:
Can a police officer use mandatory alcohol screening to demand a breath sample from a person in a bar, restaurant or their home after they have driven?

No. Mandatory Alcohol Screening (MAS) can only be used if the driver is operating a vehicle, the vehicle has been lawfully stopped, and if the police officer has the approved screening device at hand. It does not apply when drivers have returned home or arrived at their destination.
Why is it now an offence to have a BAC of at or over 80 mg within two hours of driving?

The law has been changed so a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) cannot be at or over 80 mg within two-hours after driving. This aims to discourage risky and dangerous behavior that poses a risk on our roads. The new law has eliminated the “bolus drinking” defence and has limited the “intervening drinking” defence.

For example, on a “bolus drinking” defence, a driver would admit that their BAC was over 80 mg at the time of testing. However, they could then claim to have consumed a significant amount of alcohol just before or while driving arguing that the alcohol was still being absorbed and, at the time of driving, their BAC was not over 80.

The “intervening drink” defence is used when a driver claims to have consumed alcohol after operating the vehicle but before testing. Where this defence was most frequently used was after an accident where the driver claimed they drank to ‘calm their nerves’ post-incident. This defence made it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual BAC at the time of driving.

The conduct of bolus drinking and post-driving drinking has also been the subject of negative judicial commentary, including by the Supreme Court of Canada. In addition, this new offence structure has long-been used in more than a dozen US states, including Alaska, Washington, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Utah and has, for the most part, withstood constitutional scrutiny.

Try again: No. Mandatory Alcohol Screening (MAS) can only be used if
– the driver is operating a vehicle,
– the vehicle has been lawfully stopped,
– and if the police officer has the approved screening device at hand.

It does not apply when drivers have returned home

ie if you’re stopped at a check stop, the 2 hour rule applies. If you have 0.079 % at the check stop, you’re not home free.

This law doesn’t give police the right to arbitrarily raid your house & give you a breathalyser. (Not to say they won’t try)

Guys, this isn’t complicated & don’t take it / make it personal.

My understanding is this law closes 2 loop holes:
1) if someone downs 6 shots of vodka & jumps in a car, get stopped at a checkstop they can’t claim their blood alcohol was < 0.08 when they were stopped, even though it's 0.14 when the breathalyzer reading was taken.

2) If some get's stopped at a check stop, and attempts to obstruct the process by consuming alcohol after they were stopped to invalidate the breathalyzer reading – those days are over.

Picked up a bottle of Scotch, to give as a gift, last year and was followed by a cop for about two miles. When he finally pulled me over, the only reason he offered for stopping me was “targeting”.

Would much rather they make ignition interlocks mandatory than have to deal with being “targeted” by police.

Fred from BC says:

Yeah, that’s even worse than the two hour idiocy. The police have been given the power to stop ANYONE at ANY TIME for no reason. This will continue until the first black man/woman with the financial means to hire a lawyer is pulled over for “driving while black” (as they call it down south). And to anyone who considers this a ‘minor inconvenience’, think again: you will be removed from your vehicle and placed into the back of a police vehicle for this test, apparently. Your license and insurance will naturally be checked as well, so the whole process is unlikely to take less than ten minutes even if everything goes well. That’s not a ‘minor inconvenience’.

Looking forward to both these two aspects of the new law being shot down in court.

According to this page:

“Police have long had the power to stop drivers …”

In Ontario, the police can / will set up check stops – doesn’t happen often – and yeah it’s 10 minutes, but if you know you’re under the limit it’s OK.

The difference is the new law allows the police to hold you for 2 hours – that’s an inconvenience!!

Prime Minister Chretien is our finest PM ever and loved by pretty much all Canadians for his lovable character & personality. Personally, I think everyone worries about how crushed we will all feel when he actually dies. Not worrying about him at this age is pretty much impossible from my standpoint.

Chretien, when in power, always made me feel content that I had no worries about federal leadership and could count on his good nature to lead government appropriately. He provided Canadians with an endearing & lovable leadership by example. I think jurisprudence allowed him to become benevolent in actuality. Not many are even remotely like Jean Chretien in character or persona.

That’s what you actually get some Trudeau trolls nattering about online: Andrew Scheer’s dimples.

Seriously.

For some reason beyond the understanding of sane people, the Trudeaupian types think that the Conservative leader’s dimples disqualify him as a candidate for Prime Minister. They go on about it all the time.

The same criticism used to be made about Bill Clinton. The Democratic president’s many Republican antagonists would say that Clinton’s ever-present grin was unsettling. They would say that Clinton seems to be smiling when, you know, he shouldn’t be.

In recent months, the upward tilt of Andrew Scheer’s lips haven’t been as evident. We don’t know if he’s received advice to look less happy, or if he is simply distressed by the state of Confederation. Either way, Andrew Scheer is not smirking nearly as much as he used to.

This tendency of some people to attack politicians for something over which they have no control – to wit, their physical appearance – is nothing really new.

Haters on the left attacked Doug Ford for his weight, just as they did with his deceased brother, Toronto Mayor Rob. Kathleen Wynne was mocked for resembling the Church Lady on Saturday Night Live.

And, as Wynne would certainly know, female politicians are regularly attacked – viciously, ceaselessly, unfairly – for their appearance: their hairstyle, their style of dress, their relative attractiveness. All the time.

Such attacks can change the course of political history. The infamous 1993 Conservative Party ad that pointed out the facial paralysis of my former boss, Jean Chretien, is the most infamous example. On the night those ads hit the airwaves in the midst of the 1993 federal election campaign, this writer was running Chretien’s war room at his Ottawa headquarters.

We did not know those attack ads were coming, and we were shocked when they did. Unidentified voices could be heard asking if the Liberal leader “looked like a Prime Minister.“

My boss had been waiting his whole life for that attack. He responded a few hours later, at a campaign stop in New Brunswick. He pointed out that “this was the face” that God gave him, and – unlike Tories, he said – “I don’t speak out of both sides of my mouth.“

Boom. Tories reduced to two seats.

In political back rooms, however, a great deal of time is still devoted to discussing and debating the physiology of political candidates. Example: prior to this writer arriving in British Columbia in 1996 to assist the BC Liberal campaign, some nameless genius strategist decided to stick BC liberal leader Gordon Campbell in a plaid shirt, so he would look a little more proletarian, and a little less house street.

The gambit backfired dramatically. Campbell was ridiculed for trying to be something that he was not.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau presents a political anomaly. Trudeau, like Gordon Campbell, is a handsome fellow. Even Rolling Stone gushed in a cover story that Trudeau and his family are “photogenic” and “glamorous.”

In Canada, the politicians who tend to succeed are unlike Trudeau. They are the ones who possess the hockey-rink-and-Timmmies Everyman look. Ralph Klein, Rene Levesque, Mel Lastman, Jean Chretien and Rob Ford were frequently attacked by the elites for being dishevelled or, at least, somewhat less than a Hollywood matinee idol.

But voters, clearly, loved them for it. Because, in the main, not too many voters resemble Hollywood matinee idols either.

If they’ve gotten this far, serious students of policy will be offended by all this talk about physical appearance.

They’re right. We shouldn’t make important decisions based on looks.

But, not long after he lost the aforementioned 1996 BC election, Gordon Campbell ruefully remarked to this writer: “It’s 70 per cent how you look, 20 per cent how you say it, and only 10 per cent what you say.”

Campbell knows whereof he speaks. And, if you don’t believe me, go looking for Andrew Scheer’s dimples.

They’re gone","<div class=""articlecontent"">
			<p>Dimples.</p>
<p>That’s what you actually get some Trudeau trolls nattering about online: Andrew Scheer’s dimples.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>For some reason beyond the understanding of sane people, the Trudeaupian types think that the Conservative leader’s dimples disqualify him as a candidate for Prime Minister. They go on about it all the time.</p>
<p>The same criticism used to be made about Bill Clinton. The Democratic president’s many Republican antagonists would say that Clinton’s ever-present grin was unsettling. They would say that Clinton seems to be smiling when, you know, he shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>In recent months, the upward tilt of Andrew Scheer’s lips haven’t been as evident. We don’t know if he’s received advice to look less happy, or if he is simply distressed by the state of Confederation. Either way, Andrew Scheer is not smirking nearly as much as he used to.</p>
<p>This tendency of some people to attack politicians for something over which they have no control – to wit, their physical appearance – is nothing really new.</p>
<p>Haters on the left attacked Doug Ford for his weight, just as they did with his deceased brother, Toronto Mayor Rob. Kathleen Wynne was mocked for resembling the Church Lady on Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>And, as Wynne would certainly know, female politicians are regularly attacked – viciously, ceaselessly, unfairly – for their appearance: their hairstyle, their style of dress, their relative attractiveness. All the time.</p>
<p>Such attacks can change the course of political history. The infamous 1993 Conservative Party ad that pointed out the facial paralysis of my former boss, Jean Chretien, is the most infamous example. On the night those ads hit the airwaves in the midst of the 1993 federal election campaign, this writer was running Chretien’s war room at his Ottawa headquarters.</p>
<p>We did not know those attack ads were coming, and we were shocked when they did. Unidentified voices could be heard asking if the Liberal leader “looked like a Prime Minister.“</p>
<p>My boss had been waiting his whole life for that attack. He responded a few hours later, at a campaign stop in New Brunswick. He pointed out that “this was the face” that God gave him, and – unlike Tories, he said – “I don’t speak out of both sides of my mouth.“</p>
<p>Boom. Tories reduced to two seats.</p>
<p>In political back rooms, however, a great deal of time is still devoted to discussing and debating the physiology of political candidates. Example: prior to this writer arriving in British Columbia in 1996 to assist the BC Liberal campaign, some nameless genius strategist decided to stick BC liberal leader Gordon Campbell in a plaid shirt, so he would look a little more proletarian, and a little less house street.</p>
<p>The gambit backfired dramatically. Campbell was ridiculed for trying to be something that he was not.</p>

Those dimples are not going to make the dent, not the crater you image.

But south of the border; the elephant in the room is that Joe Biden is an intellectual light weight, you can still get on the Buttiegeg bandwagon if you want. Biden actually apologized without providing info on how he would do better. Or I was too bored to follow his full speech. Let’s face it; Buttiegeg is the nuke needed to take down the Trunp machine.

Agreed. The difference is the base of the GOP is not generally interested in totalitarian statements.

They want tax cuts, debt reduction, secure borders etc. And that leaves a lot of room to manuver.

Compare that to:
Medicare for all – including illegal immigrants,
Free Post secondary education
Unlimited abortion rights – right up to the moment of birth
and a whole long list of black and white positions that whoever wins will have the impossible task of walking them back.

I think this even is qualitatively different than McGovern where the party will tear itself apart if it ever tries to walk these declarations back – the far left will bolt. If my memory of my readings about the Dem platform in ’72 they just weren’t that black and white on issues.

The Doctor says: 

July 10, 2019 at 4:19 pm

I agree there are obvious parallels to 1972 and McGovern, and that should make any Democrat nervous.

However, there are also some important differences from 1972 (which I hate to admit I’m old enough to remember). For example, Trump’s net negative ratings are way way higher than Nixon’s ever were. Nixon was good at playing to the base AND the centre. Trump is very small-tent by comparison, and it goes to his narcissistic personality that he gravitates to the alt-right base because of the unqualified adoration and narcissistic supply that they give him. Those rallies are a perfect example. As one Republican strategist put it, those rallies are empty comfort food for Trump and his supporters.

The other thing is that the “enthusiasm” and “determination to vote the other guy out” numbers are very good for the Democrats, and it looks like (unlike 1972) those may well hold up, almost no matter who the Democratic candidate is. And that is also a significant difference from 2016, when a lot of Democrats (e.g., disaffected Bernie fans) stayed home on voting day.

The other general problem is the tendency of Trump and his most rabid supporters to deny and dismiss how unpopular he is and to overestimate how popular he is (e.g., dismissing any poll that they don’t like). That’s no way to go into battle, i.e., underestimating the strength of your opposition.

I’m not predicting a Trump loss, but I think Trump has some serious problems.

Even though McGovern got tagged as the candidate of “Abortion, Amnesty and Acid” in 1972, the 1972 Democratic platform was not particularly radical by today’s standards.

It was pretty much silent on abortion (only amorphous support for “family planning”), said nothing about prison reform or decriminalization of drugs, and had a very very modest health care proposal which proposed to cover serious injuries only while rejecting single-payer. It was pro-coal and pro-nuclear power. They proposed simplifying the tax system rather than creating new taxes.

It’s a sign of how moderate it was, even by the standards of the day, that a number things it proposed were later implemented by Republican presidents: indexing Social Security to inflation, more money for low-income schools, Medicare drug benefits.

The fact that the 1972 platform was considered so “out there” at the time is pretty weird when you consider how much further to the right the American political spectrum (and the Overton window) have shifted since the 70s.





The Doctor says: 

July 12, 2019 at 12:56 pm

Gord, you make an interesting point there. I think you have to look at the Big Elephant in 1972 (which really has no equivalent today), and that’s the Vietnam War. McGovern was unequivocally against the war and in favour of immediate pullout.

Nixon, being the weasel he was, played it brilliantly. He managed to retain the redneck, middle America pro-war people while peeling off moderates claiming that pulling out would be rash and foolish. Then he and Kissinger pulled their little surprise out of their hat.

But beyond specifics, the Vietnam War had morphed into a classic culture war issue. And McGovern was identified by a lot of Archie Bunker Joe Six Pack middle Americans as being the candidate of the hippies and the flag burners.

It was pure inside baseball team to make the comment that “ I don’t speak on both sides of my mouth.” Yes a politician by definition must promise one thing to one cluster and another thing to another amorphous clump of human preference. Of course, Trudeau would have said “physician appearances do not Matter” or something flat an universally Daft and self evidently correct. Plaid shirts don’t matter much; We imagine that JC’s joke was in fact a factor in the election but to be honest there were a lot of variables at play in determine that election outcome: 2
Seats for the PC; Joe Clarke’s return etc. It was desperation. It was crass. Problem is I can’t prove that there were so many other factors and you can’t prove that it was that single shite John Tory-led ad campaign LEAK that destroyed the PC majority.

That’s interesting you mention Quebec corruption.

There are many things a politician can do to alter her or his physical appearance. Hair colour and makeup, for example. It’s called packaging. Our current PM, should he lose his position in the next general election, could be a consultant and advise politicians in how to manipulate public opinion in this way. Hint: It helps to have an official photographer paid for with public funds.

Seems to be a theme with Liberals attacking the physical characteristics of Conservative leaders.

– Stephen Harper’s eyes and introversion
– Kim Campbell’s earrings and clothes (okay, not an inherent trait)
– Brian Mulroney’s chin
– Doug Ford’s portlinous (if that’s even a word)

Conservatives never do this – the one time they did, infamously in 1993, they were rightly massacred for it.

It’s been noted by a number of smart people that the problem the Tories have is that for them, it’s majority government or bust. Which is a bit of a tall order.

The Liberals have no such problem. If it’s a minority, they’re all but certain to be propped up by some sort of Dipper/Green/BQ collective.

Plus even at 5% or whatever in the polls, Mad Max’s alt-right crusaders may well peel enough right-wing votes from the Tories to do some damage in tight races. My money’s on a Liberal minority or squeaker majority.

I don’t know. Remember the wise comment Darwin put up a while back: both the NDP and the LPC at some point propped up Harper but at least the NDP’s support was results-oriented. Translation: they actually got substantial funding in exchange for their support. So, anything can happen. IF Scheer can think out of the box and horse-trade, he could still form a minority under such circumstances.

Not outside the realm of possibility, but green/climate issues are a big priority for Green and Dipper voters, I think more so than ever.

Your point seemed to be that it’s too bad more people don’t read The Tyee (no, it’s not) and Michael Harris is still a serious journalist (no, he’s not). Right now The Tyee is begging for money (60k, to be exact) to “turn Michael Harris loose on the upcoming federal election”. It’s not going well. Doc (and others) are correct: Harris *used to* be credible…then Stephen Harper somehow broke his brain (or so it seems).

As for the always hysterically over-the-top Montreal Simon, again you’re not even close. He has the same five posters mindlessly parroting his unending hatred of anything and everything conservative (I challenge any liberal to read one of his vicious and vile diatribes and ask yourself if this is the guy you want representing your side), which is a far cry from what WK has created here.

In terms of Behavioural Modification that is utilized for ‘Gay Conversion Therapy’ it is more aptly described as torture in that no homosexuals could possibly be willing participants and therefore they are being forced to participate against their own will which makes any sort of ‘conversion therapy’ an act committed without the requisite Informed Consent which automatically renders the so-called ‘therapy’ an illegal act.

The American Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders de-pathologized homosexuality way back in the late 80s. Canada ain’t hip, man.

That’s probably true, but they *should* worry about losing the votes of people like me – fiscally conservative but socially liberal middle- to- upper-middle-class professionals (once upon a time I would have been called a Red Tory) who are fed up with Trudeau and looking wildly about for an alternative, but not sold on Scheer – mostly due to the socon factor.

What an odd comment. Why would we compare addiction interventions to conversation therapy? One of those can be legitimate and important, whereas the other is just harmful and ineffective.

And they gender bending thing… Is that something that actually happens much, in the sense you describe? And what do you mean anyway? Are you talking about social norms in terms of attire, okay preferences, mannerisms, etc., or actual dysphoria?

Both interventions are violations of the person’s individual rights.

Scheer: “We’re opposed to any type of practice that would forcibly attempt to change someone’s sexual orientation against their will.” And that he is going to wait and see what the Liberal government proposes.

Clear, unambiguous, opposition to GCT.

A new organization twists that into a news story with a #FAKENEWS headline saying he is waffling on GCT.

A shareable #FAKENEWS headline. The Telford circle of misinformation with media allies.

When the actual fact is that just four months ago Trudeau and his government “washed their hands” on the issue, saying it wasn’t their problem.

ABA for autism was created by the same guy who created GCT.

ABA is basically forcibly torturing autistic kids. There is a whole industry set up around torturing autistic kids forcing them to behave like “normal” people.

This is occuring on a far more massive scale than GCT, and funded by tax dollars. The monsters go where the money is.

For closeted homophobes, actively attacking/blocking the idea of homosexuality is what intensifies their hatred of that idea in their minds. It’s quite obvious that if I tell you to not think about a purple elephant standing on a tea cup, you just cannot NOT think of that thing right now: it is dissonant. But as soon as you let the purple elephant pass through your mind, it no longer has power of you. Legislating these homophobes out of existence will push them into a frenzied state of religious discipline; further intensifying their hatred for something that they just can’t get out of their minds. Don’t add to religious discipline by using legislation, instead passive acceptance is the way to defeat conversion therapy. The only way to help is to educate and enlighten. Sexuality is not a binary thing. It’s not 100% biological, nor is even close to 100% a choice either; it varies per person which is why letting people figure out their own internal drivers is best: provide the right information in the marketplace.

If it has no tangible upside, or is almost guaranteed to fail whether you get away with it or not, it’s most probably not the work of senior party strategists.

I’d do the same for any party. Bugger off and do some real work. Not that a Con or Liberal would get listened to at my front door in any case. They shot their bolts with me decades ago.

294,Warren Kinsella,The Hidden Conservative Voter,2019-07-22 07:00:00,Warren,,"They’re hidden.

They showed up, however, at Brexit. They showed up in the U.S. presidential race in 2016. They showed up in Alberta in 2019, and Ontario in 2018, too.

They’re the THCV – The Hidden Conservative Voter. And they’re changing politics.

June 2016: shocking just about everyone, 52 per cent of Britons voted to leave the European Union. No one really expected that result, including many of those who campaigned for Brexit.

Polls conducted in the years leading up to the Brexit vote consistently showed public opinion split on the EU membership question. A year before the crucial vote, support for the European Union spiked upward, with many more Brits favouring remaining than leaving. That, perhaps, may have been what persuaded then-Prime Minister David Cameron to push for a vote.

It was a critical error, as historians will forever note.

Subsequent vote analysis showed that young Brits favoured remaining in the Union. So did big business, lawyers, economists, scientists and the well-to-do. Voters with lower incomes and fewer higher-education degrees, however, just didn’t.

And they, unlike the young Brits and the others, came out to vote. The “leave” side surged on voting day.

Pollsters and pundits hadn’t seen it coming. Neither did the bookies, even: on the day of the vote, Ladbrokes had been giving six-to-one odds that Brexit would fail.

What happened? Sifting through the Brexit results afterwards, public opinion experts and political scientists saw something they hadn’t previously spotted: what they called, antiseptically, “unrepresentative samples.” In other words, pollsters had too many “stay” voters in their computers – and not nearly enough “leave” voters. That, the British Polling Council determined after a lengthy inquiry, was “the basic problem.”

What is most shocking is that the pollsters repeated their error in the U.S. presidential race, which happened just a few weeks after Brexit. Every single pollster, pretty much, got it wrong. Again.

The New York Times declared Hillary Clinton – who, full disclosure, this writer worked for in three different states in 2016 – had an 85 per cent chance of victory. Huffington Post said she had a 98 per cent chance of winning. The respected poll analyst Nate Silver pegged her chances at 67 per cent – while Princeton University went even further, saying it was 99 per cent.

All wrong, wrong, wrong.

And, as in Brexit, the same thing had happened: pollsters had relied upon unrepresentative samples – allowing Trump voters to hide, in effect. One analyst told GQ that Trump voters hid on purpose: “It may also turn out to be the case that supporters for Donald Trump were shamed into keeping their support quiet. Shy Trump supporters may have kept their support secret from pollsters out of social pressure not to admit their support for a candidate labelled as racist and sexist.”

The same sort of thing has happened in recent Canadian electoral contests. Polls in Alberta suggested the race between Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party and Rachel Notley’s New Democratic party was far closer than it ended up being. Ditto in Ontario, the year before: mid-campaign polls proclaimed the Andrea Horwath New Democrats had moved ahead of Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives. But it wasn’t so: the PC vote surged on voting day, and Ford won a huge majority government.

The moral of the story, here, is clear: pollsters are either missing conservative-leaning voters in their sampling – or those voters are keeping their intentions secret, Until they sit down with a stub of pencil and a ballot, that is.

It’s the THCV – The Hidden Conservative Vote. And it’s changing outcomes in elections across Western democracy.

There might be something to your larger point, but this is incorrect. A candidate with a 67 and an 85 or even a 98 per cent chance of winning is not guaranteed to win. This isn’t pedantry. A lot of people have trouble understanding the concept of probability. Of course, if polls repeatedly give underdog status to the eventual winner, their methods and models need to be revised.

A reasonable interpretation of 98% chance of winning is that if the election was run 50 time, 49 of those times, Hillary would have won. This is highly doubtful and so it is reasonable to say the poll was wrong.

There are two basic problems with political opinion polling, as distinct from normal random issues, though:1. The 95% standard (2 sigma on a normal distribution) is essentially stupid given the number of polls performed.
2. (and the bigger issue) the pollsters have to create a population model in order to determine how to adjust their non-random sample. Simply put, if you phone 500 people in Ontario at random, you will not get a random sample of political views (technically you could, but it’s overwhelmingly likely that you won’t). So what do you do? Well, you adjust the response rates based on what you calculate as the deviation between your sample and what you think the population is. For example, if you think Ontario is 35% liberal, 25% conservative, 20% NDP, and 20% other, then if you get have the people in your sample saying they are liberals, you will weight their responses at 0.7.
Since models are often wrong in times of change, such as when you have two additional parties to consider ( the Greens and the PPC), which likely aren’t part of your model ….

As in the case of the media, many voters, looking at the political leanings of a lot of the pollsters, prefer to either lie to them or refuse to answer. The lack of trust in both industries has become quite evident the past few years.

Here’s a perfect example. https://abacusdata.ca/liberals-and-conservatives-deadlocked-at-32/
As a voter I know that Abacus is owned in part by Bruce Anderson who is also its chairman. He also is an adviser to the LPC and the father of Kate Purchase, Justin Trudeau’s Dir. of Comms.
Frank Graves of Ekos was revealed as an adviser and donor to the LPC some time ago.
CBC was forced to stop using both of the them as pundits and on panels because of those connections.
Why should I as a voter, trust anything their companies produce in the way of polls?

Except for one thing. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives are missing the mark on what pollsters (no pun intended given the premise of your column) say is the most important issue to most people: climate change (even a more popular choice than health care, which surprised me). The Cons could well win a plurality of votes and seats, but I’m not so sure about a surge of CPC voters suddenly showing up on voting day.

Nobody, and I mean nobody I know has climate change anywhere on top of their list of issues, for most it’s an afterthought. Most are concerned with a recession, the affect it will have on the economy, employment and with health care. Honesty & integrity is a concern for some but not all, and finally leadership. Climate change is hardly discussed and then on how much taxes will rise!

When people, not necessarily shy CPC supporters, tell pollsters in the mid to high 60s that they want change, you know that Scheer will win, despite himself — or more particularly, his stupid mouth.

Trudeau and Butts won’t be able to counter that. In fact, because of the general dissatisfaction with this government, expect Liberal election numbers to be comparable to what Dion or Ignatieff got. A fairly good chunk of moderate-to-right LIBERALS who can’t bring themselves to vote for Scheer will stay home, rather than vote for the hapless NDP. Some progressive Liberals will go Green, the flavour of recent months.

Douglas W says: 

July 22, 2019 at 3:46 pm

Scheer needs help from someone else if he’s going to secure the most seats in the October vote. That help may come from an unlikely source: the BQ, who’s been coming on strong in the past six months, polling well outside the Montreal region. If the BQ drains enough support from the Libs in Quebec so that the Libs come out of Quebec with 40 or fewer seats, the incumbent government might be in trouble. Another horse race, like 1972.

Douglas,

I’ve been predicting a Bloc renaissance over at my place but feel somewhat less strongly about that now. My gut tells me, in fact it screams, that the election depends on this:
May says Greens will work with any party that has a serious plan for the climate.

Is this genuine or a false flag? As J.H. said earlier, if the Greens are after serious clout in 2019, their only pathway is through the Liberals. What happened the last time May met Trudeau? Was a floor-plan put in? Did they reach a political consensus — or even an informal agreement? I sense Green supporters are about to get royally played here. J.H., quite obviously, wants a CPC majority. I’ve got no double game. I’m in this to send the Liberals the electoral message of a life-time that they will never forget. My problem: by what vehicle do I go about that in Quebec? Hopefully, the polls will reveal the way forward soon enough.

The BQ are going to go hard at Justin. Nasty hard. It’ll mean that the Liberals will fight battles on two fronts: ROC + in Quebec. This is going to grind the Liberals down, and tax whatever ground game and resources they have. As for Green-leaning supporters in 2019, they recall how they put their trust in Justin in 2015, and got played; in their eyes, JT is now shallow, a fake. Greens are going to be game changers. Momentum will be theirs.





Ronald O'Dowd says:

Douglas,

This isn’t Germany or Israel. May’s marker in the sand means either propping up Trudeau or doing something with the NDP and Bloc. How can you be a game changer when your best seat projections, coupled with NDP and BQ numbers don’t come anywhere close to forming even a minority coalition government? That’s why May will inevitably go with the Liberal math. She has no other credible or realistic choice.









Miles Lunn says:

A more recent example is Australia. The last 50 polls for two years before the election in every single case said Labor Party would win the two party vote, yet when the votes were all counted the L/NP coalition went on to win a larger majority. In Danish and Finnish elections this year, the left won as expected, but the margin was much closer than most polls suggested. Of last provincial elections, UCP and CAQ both clearly outperformed polls; BC Liberals, Saskatchewan Party, Manitoba PCs, and NS PCs got what polls suggested but only in the final days as there was a last minute jump in support in all cases which some pollsters picked up. In Ontario, polls were within margin of error, but PC win was slightly larger than anticipated. In PEI, PCs outperformed polls, but so did Liberals (who were in third), while Greens underperformed (who most polls suggested would win). New Brunswick was bang on although the PCs dropped in the final week with a strong surge for the more right wing People’s Alliance (if this happens federally with Bernier’s People’s Party, Scheer is in trouble).

So trend does exist, but there are exceptions. This year in Spain, most polls showed the three right wing parties edging out the two left wing but neither having a majority while in the end two left wing edged out the three right wing but no majority. In Newfoundland polls also suggested a PC win, not Liberal, mind you NDP didn’t field candidates in 26 of 40 ridings so I suspect much of that transferred to the Liberals in those ridings thus putting them over the top.

Where it gets murky is on far right in Europe. When far right is not expected to win, they tend to outperform (see Germany 2017, Norway 2017, Belgium 2019, Finland 2019, Italy 2018, and UK 2015), but when there is a realistic threat of them winning or in case of Spain propping up the government they underperform (see Netherlands 2017, France 2017, Austria 2017, Sweden 2018, and Spain 2019) which suggests to me a lot of the far right votes in Europe are more angry citizens who want to flip the bird to the establishment, but they don’t actually want them to win. With mainstream centre-right parties, it could be partially shy voters as much our news cycle and political establishment are in the large urban centres which do vote overwhelmingly for progressive parties and they are struggling to connect with suburbs and rural areas who don’t share same priorities. Other reason could simply be demographics of who shows up. Generally parties on right do better amongst older voters who are more likely to show up on election day.

Your column somewhat reflects the various theories that are tossed about to explain this. The main ones being:
1. conservative voters deliberately lie to pollsters

2. conservative voters “hide from” pollsters

3. polling outfits are part of the insidious Deep State liberal conspiracy and deliberately make up fake polls to suppress the conservative vote (I’m not kidding, this one is all over Breitbart, for example)

4. most polling outfits engage in practices that underreport and undersample the conservative vote

5. related to #4 really: conservative-friendly demographics (e.g., old white people) simply vote more than liberal/left friendly demographics.

Personally I think 4 and 5 are closer to the truth.

I notice, for example, that you get markedly different results on a political polling question depending on whether you are polling the population at large, likely voters or registered voters.

A lot of Trump supporters and alt-righters are very much invested in attacking the polling industry these days, citing 2016 and Brexit as evidence. Problem is, Trump supporters have taken those incidents and blown them up way out of proportion, so now, of course, it’s evidence of yet another Deep State Conspiracy.

I am no expert in the numbers but when looking at percentages of support for a specific party, I don’t think it takes into account if they actually vote.

It is said that Conservatives will walk barefoot across glass in order to vote. The point being that from the polls if the Cons and Libs are statistically tied, the Conservatives will get a higher percentage when the votes come in. More Liberals will say they are voting Liberal but less show up and vote.

There might be another related effect in our upcoming Fed election. Last election more Libs turned up because they wanted to get rid of Harper. That same feeling won’t be there for Scheer.

I think the polling orgs tilt left – just like the media. And as a result they skew their methods and results both unconsciously and consciously (the latter absolutely in AB and with Beto vs Cruz.

In a very related story in Canada – it is startling how the laurentians don’t have a realistic understanding- appreciation- of how the interior west feels it is being treated with contempt (and has been since the region was opened up) by them. And how close Albertans et al are (to para-quote Springsteen) getting so sick of the fighting that they will lose their fear in the end.

Graves’ latest thoughts in The Hill are a perfect example- he and many others don’t see the geographic element here and around the world.

The pushback is coming from upstream geographically. The people downstream at the commercial embarkation/disembarkation centres have no appreciation or understanding of the issues the people upstream care about. They used to have the power to make laws – nafta, EU, carbon regulation, woke laws because of their concentrated population and the unity it creates.

Now the diffuse lower population regions that harvest and make the things that rely on the services and infrastructure that the high population downstream regions provide have the internet to communicate with one another outside of the old-line media centres (naturally headquartered downstream) not unlike the pamphleteers of the 17th century. And thus they now have a voice and with that voice are finding politicians and political parties that will take up their cause.

And it should be noted that they are not hard conservatives- far from it. From trumpsters to yellow jackets they support some big government entitlements, isolationist trade areas, and aren’t much interested in debt reduction.

So Warren you, and many many others continue to miss what is actually happening. Remember that Trump won because many Obama voters supported his defence of upstreamers – the residents of the hinterlands. And they will again if the Dems continue to see this as a right-left fight.

Ditto in Canada and the rest of the globe.

I think one crucial thing you’ve overlooked WK, in both the case of Brexit & Trump, is the “overconfident” small-l liberal: because the polls showed their side with such a comfortable lead / quite high probability of winning, a lot of them didn’t bother to vote, thinking it was not necessary. That is how Brexit squeeked through with such a slim margin and how Trump only won the electoral college but got 3 million fewer votes.
So, what remains to be seen is how motivates small-l (in addition to large L) liberal voters are to get to the polls whether in advance or on e-day. The polls are fairly close for one thing (or a toss up), and I’m sensing that after seeing Brexit & Trump happen there is a “fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me” feeling among the small-l electorate and that they know better now that they can’t sit on their hands since small-c (and large C) conservatives will overwhelmingly get out and vote.

There’s no question in my mind that some Democratic Party voters stayed home in 2016 because they thought Hillary had it in the bag — because polls seemed to say that she did.

Ok its a theory.

Or it could be that after decades of having politicians promise that they are working for the little guy or the common middle class, but end up with government that makes more laws telling the same folks what they can’t do and what they can’t say, or even laws that compel thought, folks are just ready to vote in a way that will make the governments life difficult.
All they need is all the indications that a particular candidate or outcome will be the one that will constrict and limit what the government does.
The indications would be that candidate, party or outcome the experts and pundits attack in a seemingly unified effort.
Whoever that is, under these circumstances has a good chance of winning.
Should such an outcome happen, the media and pundits would only confirm it by pursuing a theory that the outcome was rigged, or because someone cheated, or some kind of collusion conspiracy.
But if you want to go with the hidden voters theory, its likely just as good as mine.

They don’t stage 350+ incidents of fake attacks on white people….etc, etc.

They are going to be instrumental in re-electing Donald Trump in the US and electing Andrew Scheer in Canada, followed by much wailing and gnashing of teeth as they flail about blaming racists, bigots, ‘homophobes’, misogynists, white supremacists and all their other favorite scapegoats.

The New York Times declared Hillary Clinton – who, full disclosure, this writer worked for in three different states in 2016 – had an 85 per cent chance of victory. Huffington Post said she had a 98 per cent chance of winning. The respected poll analyst Nate Silver pegged her chances at 67 per cent – while Princeton University went even further, saying it was 99 per cent.

All wrong, wrong, wrong.

——————————-

Probability is neither wrong nor right. I especially wouldn’t classify Nate Silver’s 67% as “wrong”. Up until the last moment, it was perfectly reasonable to say that Clinton had a 2/3 chance of winning. Everything had to go just right in several states for the other 1/3 to effectuate, and that’s exactly what happened. I will note that the popular vote pre-election polls were mostly correct.

291,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: Butts, back, big bother",2019-07-23 11:41:00,Warren,,"Kick me.

Here’s a little-known fact: The “kick me” sign — which is usually affixed to some hapless soul’s back or behind, for laughs — was apparently devised by merry-making Scots during the 16th Century.

They did it to celebrate April Fool’s. “Kick me” thereafter became so popular, it spread to the British Isles and then rest of the world.

And so, this week, the Liberal Party of Canada stuck a “kick me” sign to its collective keester, and invited all of us to do precisely that.

The occasion? Not April Fool’s, although it certainly felt like it could be. No, the “kick me” moment heralded the inauspicious return of Justin Trudeau’s former principal secretary, and his forever-BFF, Gerald Butts.

Butts showed up for some Liberal campaign meeting. People noticed.

Yes, that Gerald Butts. He of the SNC-Lavalin meta-scandal — the one who helped propel #LavScam into hashtag hagiography.

He — the one who told us a million times that he’s a coal miner’s son. Him, the one who also told the chief of staff to the Attorney-General of Canada that Trudeau’s cabal wanted to short-circuit the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Liberal Party donor.

Him, “Gerry,” who famously said of interfering in the coming corruption trial of SNC-Lavalin that “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”

Him. Gerald Butts. He’s back.

Now, before everyone starts reaching for the smelling salts, there is a passable pretext to justify the return of Butts. For one thing, he’s smarter than all of PMO put together. And, the wheels started to come off PMO the moment Butts left.

The Liberal Party commenced sliding precipitously in the polls. Patronage scandals sprouted up like weeds. And, of course, there was this stirring bit of oratory, which ranks up there with the Gettysburg Address: “We have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of water, when we have water bottles out of a plastic sorry away from plastic towards paper-like drink-box, water-bottle sorta things.”

So, on the one hand, it makes a bit of sense that Butts is back. But, on the other, it doesn’t at all.

Two reasons.

One, Butts — fairly or not — became the face of LavScam. And not in a good way. Former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott came to embody decency, honesty and a belief in the independence of our prosecutorial system.

Butts, meanwhile, came to be seen as a guy who may have done something wrong. Why would he have resigned if that were not so?

LavScam hammered the Liberal Party in public opinion. It shredded Justin Trudeau’s promise of sunny ways. And it left his oft-made claims to be a feminist — to be the indigenous reconciler, to be the guy who’d bring back ethical government — in tatters after he expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott for having the temerity to speak up for the rule of law.

There’s a second reason why Gerald Butts’ return is dumb, dumb, dumb. And it’s that hoary old chestnut, Liberal arrogance.

“Liberal arrogance” has recurred so many times in Canadian politics, it practically deserves its own entry in Mel Hurtig’s Canadian Encyclopedia series. Liberal arrogance — that Grit belief that they alone know what is best for Canada, and are in fact synonymous with all that is good in Canada — is deadly.

Liberal arrogance has felled many a Liberal government. It is the greatest Grit weakness. And the return of Gerald Butts signals its unfortunate return, in marquee lights.

Butts is back. LavScam is back. Liberal arrogance is back.

And, of course, there was this stirring bit of oratory, which ranks up there with the Gettysburg Address: “We have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of water, when we have water bottles out of a plastic sorry away from plastic towards paper-like drink-box, water-bottle sorta things.”</p>
<p>So, on the one hand, it makes a bit of sense that Butts is back. But, on the other, it doesn’t at all.</p>
<p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>One, Butts — fairly or not — became the face of LavScam. And not in a good way. Former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott came to embody decency, honesty and a belief in the independence of our prosecutorial system.</p>
<p>Butts, meanwhile, came to be seen as a guy who may have done something wrong. Why would he have resigned if that were not so?</p>
<p>LavScam hammered the Liberal Party in public opinion. It shredded Justin Trudeau’s promise of sunny ways. And it left his oft-made claims to be a feminist — to be the indigenous reconciler, to be the guy who’d bring back ethical government — in tatters after he expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott for having the temerity to speak up for the rule of law.</p>
<p>There’s a second reason why Gerald Butts’ return is dumb, dumb, dumb. And it’s that hoary old chestnut, Liberal arrogance.</p>
<p>“Liberal arrogance” has recurred so many times in Canadian politics, it practically deserves its own entry in Mel Hurtig’s Canadian Encyclopedia series. Liberal arrogance — that Grit belief that they alone know what is best for Canada, and are in fact synonymous with all that is good in Canada — is deadly.</p>
<p>Liberal arrogance has felled many a Liberal government. It is the greatest Grit weakness. And the return of Gerald Butts signals its unfortunate return, in marquee lights.</p>
<p>Butts is back. LavScam is back. Liberal arrogance is back.</p>
<p>Kick them: they deserve it.</p>

We don’t see eye to eye on the beginning of the end: in my book it was India. And who was still there presiding over that train wreck, along with Telford…?

Guess who argued for a complete turnover in the top three-four back then? But this Prime Minister is a man who puts the so-called qualities of friendship above anything else. Not smart.

So, Justin has got Butts back, along with Telford, Purchase and the rest of the happy crew. Enjoy the ride!

Butts is a master at the art of deflection. He’s certainly not going to allow himself to be the storyline of the election. Libs will focus on Ford; they’ll highlight a relatively strong economy; and they’ll also say: can you truly trust those guys over there (meaning the CPC)? He’s good. Opposition parties’ strategists need to be better. Can they be?

When Butts “resigned”, was he paid a severance? How much? And he’s back, but never really left? Advised Justin as an unregistered political consultant? Ah, yes. Doing things differently. Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.

Trudeau is obviously counting on a mini media firestorm that won’t have any legs during the dog days of summer. And a short attention span of the electorate as in “what was that Lavscam thing all about anyway…?” If I were the opposition parties, I’d be starting my SNC-Butts strategy right about now. Tailor made for Justin and Gerry.

I’m not so sure given only her partial lifting of SCP and cabinet confidence. She’s not about to stretch that elastic — even in an election campaign.

I doubt this will have any effect one way or another. Scheer can harp on LavScam all he wants – the electoral math just isn’t there for him anymore.

The Liberals could hang onto power by cobbling together a majority coalition with the Greens and the NDP. None of the other parties are likely to prop up the Tories, so they need to get a majority or something close to it (160+ seats). I don’t see where they get another 60 seats. Maybe they squeeze another dozen out of the West, and maybe a dozen in Atlantic Canada. Any gains in Quebec will be washed out by the collapse of the NDP vote to the Liberals. The Tories’ road to victory runs straight through suburban Ontario, and suburban Ontario is mighty pissed at Ford and thus unlikely to embrace his federal cousins.

Our only hope is that the Liberals have a near-death experience that convinces caucus to dump Justin as leader and replace him with a grownup.

I’m not holding my breath, but I see it as the best possible outcome at this point.

I’d like to think that their own craven political self-interest will carry the day, if they no longer see him as their meal ticket.

Everything points to it being done on behalf of the CIB itself, which again, I suspect is a totally standard thing for any agency’s communications department to do.

I did ask whether WK had ever seen/done this before in his work, and his silence is deafening. I agree with many of his attacks on the Liberals, but this one appears to be transparently phony from where I’m sitting.

A Conservative friend of mine supported Bernier in the CPC leadership race and, like many, felt he was cheated of the crown. He followed Bernier into his new party and even became a founding member of his local EDA, but noped out of there not long thereafter when this kind of crap started happening too frequently for it to be an accident.

I’d love to see Scheer really go after them. “There’s the door” was a good start, but I think he has a golden opportunity to show Canadians that his brand of conservatism is an open and inclusive one. David Cameron gave one of the greatest speeches in favour of same-sex marriage I’ve ever heard: “Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative – I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.”

I mean this really should be a no-brainer for Scheer. If he wants to win, he needs a “Sister Soulja” moment. A public lambasting and denunciation of Mad Max and his minions would provide it.

As a social and political conservative–and a founding member of the Reform Party’s move eastward–I briefly looked at Bernier and People’s Party of Canada.

My conclusion is that they are evolving into the Canadian wing of the GOP.

No thanks.

At one time I was concerned that Bernier might split the right. Today, I am relieved that the Pied Piper of Trumpism has rid the Conservative Party of its GOP influences.

Criticizing a Congreeman for the sorry state of his district after 20 years in power is not racism. This in light of Baltimore receiving $16 BILLION in Grant’s last year. Where does the money go?
Telling people who complain about the US, it’s not racist to tell them to leave if they don’t like it.

Sorry Ronald….no racism in evidence there . Well, except for the Squad member who thinks blacks should only represent other blacks, and maybe the two anti-Semites (oops…spoke too soon: AOC has now made an anti-Semitic statement as well; before this, she was only guilty of having the worldview of a 13-year-old…)

Bernie Sanders, the mayor of Baltimore and even Cummings himself have all said similar things about the particular district in question (which is NOT the entire city of Baltimore and Donald Trump never said that it was), along with many other politicians and activists…why are they all getting a pass here?

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump does so much bad stuff already that you DON’T NEED TO TELL LIES about him. There’s a reason that his popularity isn’t being hurt by this; the half of the American voters who think he is a racist is the same half who have always believed it (ie: the Democratic half)…the other half aren’t falling for it.

You’re playing right into his hands, and he’s going to be re-elected because of it.





Ronald O'Dowd says:

Fred,

We won’t agree on this one. When I take his cumulative rhetoric since his inauguration, I don’t come to the same conclusion that you do. But I will give you this: do I think some members of the squad have made racist remarks? Yes I do. So on that basis, I put those who did in the same boat as Trump.

And do I think Trump will use the immigration and subtle racism cards to be re-elected? Yup. And will it work? Of course it will, because the American mentality is not one of catering to their better angels…





Ronald O'Dowd says: 

July 31, 2019 at 10:27 am

Fred,

Trump, per se, is a politically LOSING issue for Democrats. That’s what many progressive Democrats don’t get…

The Democratic nominee can beat Trump but it’s only possible on the issues most concerning to the American people.

Impeachment, though distinctly possible, is a complete waste of time as the Senate will never convict. (See Clinton.) Charges being laid against Trump upon leaving office is another pipe dream, (Again, see Clinton re: the Paula Jones deposition and his Starr testimony where he admitted to perjury and obstruction of justice.)

So Democrats, get your shit together and trounce Trump on what really matters. Stop acting like rank amateurs. Listen to Pelosi for heaven’s sake.

“And do I think Trump will use the immigration and subtle racism cards to be re-elected? Yup. And will it work? Of course it will, because the American mentality is not one of catering to their better angels…”

I think you’ve nailed it right there, Ronald. I still don’t think he’s a racist, but I think he *pretends* to be one when it suits him. Donald Trump is well known for making wild, out of the blue and outrageously provocative statements just to get attention. Some of his stated opinions are even contradictory…he doesn’t care, because it keeps his opponents off-balance, doesn’t it?

Crazy like a fox, it seems…

“Umm, how about Trump continuing to insists that the Central Park Five are guilty, when they have definitively been proven innocent?”

Not to the satisfaction of everyone, it seems. Many police and prosecutors still say they are guilty (for a few different reasons which I won’t go into here…look it up if you must…). Are all those people “racists” as well? Maybe, like Donald Trump, they just hate to admit when they are wrong?

(and why do the people who keep pushing this “Donald Trump hates black people” BS keep ignoring all his black friends, associates and employees?)

“How about Trump cruising around his New York rental properties and taking concrete steps to ensure that blacks would not be allowed to rent at said properties?”

How about you start checking your facts before you slander people?

___________________________
MEDIA MEME:
Donald Trump was a racist landlord who was sued by the U.S. Justice Department for not renting to African Americans. After he didn’t change his racist rental policies, the Dept. of Justice sued him again.

WHAT REALLY HAPPENED:
Fred Trump created a rental company, ran it for decades, and by 1973 it managed 14,382 apartments. By then, 17 African Americans had filed 15 complaints of discrimination in the application process. Also, four “testers” were sent to five Trump properties. They found that four rental employees discriminated. So in 1973, the Department of Justice filed a complaint against Fred Trump, Trump Management, and its new president, young Donald. At properties operated by them, almost 4.5% of tenants were black. One building had 40% black tenants. But five buildings had none. By 1974, the DOJ had collected accusations (formal, informal, and hearsay) by 43 accusers (named and unnamed) against 38 employees (out of hundreds) of Trump Management in 20 properties (out of 39), during 14 years. Three of them blamed Fred Trump. None of the 43 accusers blamed Donald Trump; there’s no evidence that he created or carried out discriminatory policies. In 1975, the Trumps began policies of affirmative action renting, to reach 10% black occupancy. By 1977, they exceeded this requirement. Finally, the DOJ closed the case for “lack of evidence” or new complaints.

Jesus Christ Fred, the Central Park Five were exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence. What confessions occurred were demonstrably coerced, false and incoherent in the context of the facts.

“Jesus Christ Fred, the Central Park Five were exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence. What confessions occurred were demonstrably coerced, false and incoherent in the context of the facts.”

I agree, although some might argue (not me, in this case) the while DNA doesn’t lie, the people who manipulate it sometimes do (and have been caught at it, in fact). I actually don’t believe they were guilty either.

My point was that you can’t take Trump’s refusal to admit the truth as evidence of racism, because it’s not. It’s arrogant, childish, stubborn and a whole lot of other things (in other words, typical Donald Trump)….but NOT evidence of racism. Not unless he makes specific statements about their race that prove otherwise.

Speaking as a social and political conservative…

Seeing what is going on in the U.S. with Trumpism overtaking the GOP, I think it is probably in Scheer’s best interest to stay as far away from Bernier as possible. The Peoples Party of Canada has basically evolved into the Canadian wing of the GOP.

Last year at this time I was concerned about Maxime splitting the right. However, watching the GOP under Trump stir racial politics has left me horrified. If Trumpists are to exert any influence in Canadian politics, I would much rather they start their own political party than attempt to exert influence within the Conservative Party.

Provoking racial tension and distrust is socially irresponsible, fiscally destructive, and–I believe as a practicing Christian–morally and spiritually repugnant.

Bernier’s pledge to halve Canada’s immigration intake is a winning position. It would STILL he higher than the US intake per capita (yes, even after halving it – that’s how extreme Canada’s current target is) and it’s a position a very sizeable chunk of the electorate could support. Take some pressure off Canadian cities’ infrastructure and Canadian salaries and assimilate existing immigrants. It’s a good plan.

Why he had to pair the above perfectly legitimate position with a weird appeal to the far-right is beyond me! What does he think he’s doing? He’s going to lose potentially tens of thousands of voters attracted to his immigration message because they can’t stomach the racial overtones.

Warren,
A simple photo with someone going through a handshake lineup does not mean friendship. I’m sure over the years you’ve had to shake hands with a few people you yourself may agree or disagree with. To imply a relationship based on what appears to be a carefully cropped photo is unfair.

This appears to be a meet and greet line in a hotel room, which is how Bernier has been conducting business for months. I went to one of his meetings, not as a show of support, but because I wanted to hear his platform and evaluate him based on that.

My observation was that there definitely were clueless and ignorant racists in attendance, but instead of encouragement, they were given the cold shoulder. A person I know spoke with Bernier privately after and was not given nudge-nudge, wink-wink answers implying racism, but instead fairly libertarian answers, which is what Bernier has been campaigning on all along.

I haven’t been to one of his meetings since. Maybe they’ve devolved into KKK-style rants? I doubt it. I suspect the neo-Nazis are attending in hopes of achieving their goals through Bernier, but I seriously doubt he is actually endorsing Hitlerian views, or we would have heard about it from the mainstream media. I imagine that these fascist fanciers will be disappointed.

Maybe I’m wrong and these two guys are the best of pals. If you can show proof of that, aside from a cropped photo, you should do so.

This is not written as an endorsement of Bernier. I haven’t followed his escapades this summer. I simply wanted to point this picture may not tell the story that’s implied.

Most Canadians would like a more reasonable and responsible immigration policy, according to polls. As Bernier is the only politician talking about lower immigration, a few that attend his events may have more extreme views on immigration but that doesn’t mean their views are Bernier’s views. It’s likely that this photo is one of hundreds taken of attendees who waited to have photos with Bernier. It’s misleading and not fair to claim friendship if the article doesn’t present any further facts to support that.

Canada has the highest per capita immigration intake in the Western world except for New Zealand. It’s 3 times the rate of the US. Not coincidentally, Canadian salaries are peanuts compared to equivalent positions in the US and Toronto and Vancouver have become two of the most expensive cities in the WORLD.

Our cities need a break from excessively high immigration and our workers need a chance for their salaries to rise to something more commensurate with the cost of living.

Bernier is a hero for firing the opening salvo on an issue long ignored by the mainstream parties. I’m annoyed that he’s screwing it up but you may well be right – he may have had no idea who that guy was and it’s not like he can screen all attendees to his events.

Why did Fromm endorse Bernier? Because it has less to do with increasing votes for Bernier, and more to do with increasing Fromm’s profile with his own base.

Fromm is many things, but he’s not stupid. He knows he is perceived as a racist fringe nutjob by most people, and he knows Bernier doesn’t have any chance of winning. However, Fromm does have a small but rabid base who want to see him out in the public eye, and attaching himself to well-known individuals. Endorsing Bernier, and the controversy it generates, achieves that goal.

Another Post opinon writer (John Ivison) is opposed to this fund as well, and has written about it numerous times. Their employer, on the other hand, is rather more supportive.

The Torstar Corp reported a $17.4 M second quarter loss this past week. Apparently, revenues continue to decline, even after accounting for $6 M of federal funds. After excluding restructuring costs, the loss was “only” 2 cents per share. Perhaps other journalists (if Delacourt is worthy of the name) will be included in the next round of downsizing.

Culpability for a scandal would require a level of understanding / intellectual impetus from the person assumed to be the ring leader. Ex: Nixon, Clinton, Mulroney etc… We can all agree that these men are at least capable of being behind a scandal. The problem with attaching PM Zoolander to something as complex as the SNCL scandal is that no one thinks he understands what happened or why it was wrong… It is generally assumed by political people and the electorate that bureaucrats and partisan hacks run this government in place of this fake / cardboard cutout PM. This is why the SNCL scandal probably won’t be attached to PM Zoolander – we all know he is just doing what he is told by some very smart people and probably will never ask any questions about anything from anyone, ever.

Sean,

Don’t agree with your conclusions. Trudeau is by no means the resident PMO genius but his statement to JWR that “I am an MP in Quebec, the Member for Papineau.” shows that he knows precisely what SNC is about. For Trudeau, it’s all about a political fix and he gets it in spades.

I won’t be voting Liberal because of how JWR and JP were treated. However, JWR doesn’t help herself when she goes the cop out route. We all know she’s got a pretty good idea why interference occurred and it would be politically astute for her and JP to express that. Come on, her statement is too cute by half and nobody is going to believe it.

Selling a product you know will likely cause the death of tens to hundreds of millions while lying about it seems like it should fall under the category of crimes against humanity.

We need a new category of crime for this, because it’s not the first time this has happened. Cigarette companies knew they product caused cancer even before the scientific consensus but denied it for decades. Antacid companies knew ulcars where caused by bacteria that could be easily cured, but hid it, losing out on a Nobel Prize. I’m sure there are many other examples, large and small.

I’m sure some tobacco users perceive some benefits, especially those who dismiss the long term consequences.

I’m suggesting jailing (not suing) those who knowingly understate the dangers of their products or suppress significant scientific information about them. J. D. Rockefeller lived long before the there was scientific consensus on climate change in 1980.

I do realize getting a conviction to stick on a change like this would be difficult, but it would act as a powerful deterrent.

“I’m sure some tobacco users perceive some benefits, especially those who dismiss the long term consequences.”

I don’t want to get into back and forth at all, especially on someone else’s blog post. But do you realize how hoity-toity this statement is, it sounds like a statement from an elitist who thinks he knows better than everyone. Smoking and Tobacco in general is an addiction, it makes people sick, and tears families apart.

Second, the idea of supporting a lynch mob to jail retired people in the oil industry is maddening. To think that somehow the system could hold McCarthy style investigations into everyones lives, and pluck the few who are guilty is sick.

Shake my head.

Those who insist on expanded meanings of these emotionally-charged words can’t also insist they keep packing their highly evocative original punch. If Canada committed genocide, the U.S. is running concentration camps, oil companies are committing crimes against humanity and it’s a human right to demand somebody shave your junk, people are going to start taking a ho-hum attitude to such concepts. You can see this going on right now in the States with the word racism. Trump is a racist, anybody who wears a MAGA hat is a racist and, now more and more, anyone that is thinking of voting for him is a racist. A few decades ago, that was a damning, destructive, humiliating charge. Now more and more people are just responding “Yea, whatever.”

278,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: Star, CBC no longer lead the way",2019-08-04 08:26:00,Warren,,"How the media mighty have fallen.

Way, way back, when this writer was a special assistant to opposition leader Jean Chretien, getting ready for the daily Question Period ritual was simple.

Chretien’s staff, and select Liberal MPs, would gather in the panelled boardroom in room 409-S in Centre Block on Parliament Hill. There, early every weekday morning, we would determine what questions to ask of the government of prime minister Brian Mulroney — and, very briefly, that of prime minister Kim Campbell.

As noted, it wasn’t hard. One of the staffers would read out what the lineup of stories had been on CBC’s The National the night before. Then we would eyeball the front page of the Toronto Star.

Presto! We’d have our lineup for Question Period, as determined by the CBC and the Star.

Like Mulroney, like Campbell, those days are no more. The CBC and the Toronto Star no longer have the political impact they once did.

The numbers tell the story, and it’s not a happy one (for them). At the Star, “revenue (has) continued to decline sharply year-over-year — especially in terms of sales of print advertising space to national accounts.” The source? None other than the Star itself.

Just this week, the once-mighty Star reported a whopping $17.4 million loss in the second quarter of 2019, as its revenues plummeted. That’s even after closing up operations in Hamilton, and slashing jobs.

At the National Newspaper Awards ceremony in May, the Star captured one award. The Globe and Mail, to cite just one example, won 10.

The Star’s national bureau in Ottawa, meanwhile, is led by Susan Delacourt, and it hasn’t had a big scoop in a long, long time. That’s astonishing, when you consider that the Liberal Party holds power. In Ottawa, everyone knows that the likes of the Globe’s Bob Fife breaks the big stories like LavScam and Norman-gate – and the likes of Postmedia’s Andrew Coyne and John Ivison are the ones who dominate federal politics opinion-making. Delacourt’s bureau just doesn’t factor on either front.

The CBC, meanwhile, has plenty of problems, too.

Just before election day in 2019, CBC’s then-president whinged that the public broadcaster was at risk of “extinction,” quote unquote. Justin Trudeau got the message. Once installed in power, Trudeau forked over $115 million to CBC. For good measure, it threw in another $35 million.

But despite that, CBC’s national impact continues to shrink. Its flagship news program — the one that used to literally determine what topics were covered in Question Period — is failing. In the past two years alone, its viewership has nose-dived a mammoth 24%.

A few weeks ago, even the CBC’s editor-in-chief Jennifer McGuire was forced to admit that The National isn’t all what it once was: “Are we pleased with the overall state of The National? I think the answer is no.”

She shouldn’t be pleased with the overall state of CBC’s relevance to the federal political scene, either. Despite being the recipient of millions in tax dollars — and despite being allowed to use that unfair advantage to compete in major markets with private-sector media competitors — the CBC simply isn’t breaking big national stories like it used to.

At the most recent Canada’s Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) awards, Global won a dozen awards for excellence. CTV, which regularly clobbers The National in the ratings game, picked up the RTDNA’s best national newscast award. CBC radio and its regional stations won some RTDNA awards, but none were for national political stories.

What does it all mean? Maybe nothing.

But to Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, facing a hotly contested election in just over 90 days, it isn’t good. In the past, the Star and CBC could always be counted on to light the way for Grits, and help secure wins.

True, if you add up the poll data for all the parties the skew to the left it makes up nearly 70%, but most Canadians that actually vote are older, rural, jobless or having a hard time economically, and have too much time on their hands. Dangerous combo for leftist parties. One thing to take part in a poll, another to actually vote. Being 30-something and working in the suburbs, along with family problems, I missed out on my minicipal elections here recently. Not making the same mistake for the federal. Its actually one of the reasons I switched to a less demanding job just in time for the election season, but most other people around here wouldnt be concious of making a decision like that.

What you say at the very end is both extremely scary, and 100% true – “In the past, the Star and CBC could always be counted on to light the way for Grits, and help secure wins.”
How could a publicly funded organization show any type of bias at all. That is what happens in 3rd world countries. It is likely time to consider de-funding the CBC. Which by default is also a means of helping all the private broadcasters – which will eliminate the need for that bailout as well.

Even the news coverage in the normally-excellent NYT has become so slanted that I recently cancelled my online subscription. Sorry, not interested in reading another piece about how the white working class are destroying American society, or why we all need to unquestioningly support children performing at adult drag shows.

The Globe is miles ahead of anything else in Canadian journalism. Look at all the Globe stories and investigations that actually forced changes – eg the high rate of dismissal of sexual assault complaints by police, the obscene criminal activity that has destroyed Vancouver for generations of young families, the dismal track record of securities regulators in actually enforcing fines, the shady goings on at the TDSB, etc.

The CBC and The Toronto Star have become nothing more than narrative enforcers for the Telford PR machine. How can they break stories? Their job is to tell and emphasize the stories the PMO wants told.

Both were chosen as organisers for the so-called “non-partisan” debate. Telford will get to dictate most of the questions. And Trudeau will get to see them before hand.

You know, it’s really strange how their online comment section works (if and when comments are allowed, which precludes most discussions about racism and “gender identity”). Most of the commenters seem to be Conservatives, which is quite surprising considering how most of their stories have an overt Liberal slant to them. Weird…

On Youtube? Oh, you noticed that too? Not only are 95% of the comments they get from ppl who obviously skew to the right but most of them dont seem to have watched any bit of the video they were commenting on (maybe just read the title and thats it). Its really annoying when I want to see some ligitimate feedback and discussion. They say something like “oh look, the CBC showing their lefty bias again!” And I ask them about where in the video that was, and they never reply. I wouldnt blame the CBC from blocking comments for most of their videos in that case. The internet is a crazy, crazy place…

Using social media for “news” is one of the key reasons we have the Mango Mussolini in the White House right now.

Social media is not news. It is, at best, sound bites of news that strip away most of the meaning and context. But often it is much worse than that. Opinions and half-truths masquerading as fact.

Those who truly care about understanding a topic will take the time to pick up a newspaper or read a fully-written article online (like from the NYT, G&M, or Atlantic).

Lazy people who want their news during the commercial breaks of watching the Kardashians will rely on social media. And their vote negates the vote of knowledgeable people. Sad times indeed.

Agree wholeheartedly. Social media has not been a net benefit to society, not at all. Misinformation, online bullying and the Outrage Mob I can live without, which is why I have never had a Facebook or Twitter account and never will.

Oh, and if you want to actually “do something” about both mass shootings and online radicalization of young people by terrorist organizations –

(and when I say “do something”, I’m not talking about the standard Liberal practice of throwing a useless law at the problem, then patting yourself on the back and bragging about how you just “solved” the problem (you didn’t, sorry), I’m talking about taking actual action that results in tangible, measurable benefits)

– don’t bother trying to take away the guns of people who don’t abuse them or freedom of association from people who don’t misuse that either. Do something real for a change: BAN SOCIAL MEDIA. Because THAT would make a difference. THAT would yield results that we could all see and appreciate.

Social media technology is just that. It gets misused like any other.

What needs to be stopped is censorship by its owners/operators. Not much longer before they are regulated to act like the telcos and the postal service.

As for anonymous participants that comes to an end within the decade as the cloud era ends and blockchain and its derivatives are adopted.

I very much appreciate the stories of Parliament given that I have still yet to take a tour of Parliament and have only seen it from the outside. Stories of the Chretien days are the best given that he was the most fun PM of all time bar none.

Newspapers are so quaint today it is of no wonder why they are disappearing en masse. I, for one, think that the website format replaced the brick & mortar buildings and things are just evolving to online blogosphere type political punditry.

What I do is pretty much the same as everyone in that I search the right & left domains for the type of balanced news reporting we all used to get back when PM Chretien was in power. Heck, back when Mulroney was in power I was reading the Globe, Ottawa Citizen, & Ottawa Journal every day. Today, I would never be able to afford three newspapers daily. Times have changed the infrastructure of news reporting & the 80s type of work schedule to meet the lifestyle of today’s journalists and the way they report on news or conduct research for news articles.

Cost wise I think the move was much more financially responsible in that the 80s style of news reporting was high cost compared to today with email. Can you imagine what it would be like if we went back to writing snail mail with CANADA Post stamps? We would stop writing as much.

Oh! To try and get a comment on. Here goes:CBC is run by and uses as reporters and journalists well-fed, sated, self-satisfied and smug elitists. It comes across and people notice. The Star? No clue. Never read it anymore. As Orwell wrote: “The typical Socialist…youthful snob-Bolshevik…probably have made a wealthy marriage…often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with a social position which he has no intention of forfeiting.” Hunger is a powerful motivator.

The National Post lost money from 1998 to 2011. While the goal of supporting the right was explicit, if its goal wasn’t to make money, that means it was subsidized for some other reason. I believe it was to promote tax cuts and other neo-liberal policies.

Communism as an example where equalized distribution is in affect kills initiative as well as prohibits it. When the free press is no longer associated with freedom of the press than people intuitively and intellectually perceive truth of told at all is biased.

Everyone on the internet keeps telling me that the CBC has a leftest bias and is apparently dead-set on helping the Liberals or maybe other leftest parties while putting the conservatives down. As someone who’s watched CBC almost every day for the past 15 years I have yet to see any evidence of this myself, could someone please finally point me to some evidence of this? I started trusting the CBC more than other news networks precisely because it isn’t a commercial service like the US’s CNN, since its funded by taxpayers more than ad revenue, and because from what I’ve seen myself, they just gives the facts, good or bad, for whatever party those facts are relavent to. If the Cons ever look bad, its of their own making, just like the the past year the Libs got no special treatment for their stupidities either. Being a fan of CBC I should be loving the Liberals right now, right? Nope. Unbelievable to some, I’m sure.

Even if I agree personally with left-leaning parties in general, I’m finding all of them to be weak and problematic, tbh. I actually hate the party system in general, but the Libs and Cons are never gonna disappear because once people start to see something as part of their heritage, its like a kid and a beloved teddy bear thats never been washed and even though its become grotesque and unhealthy its still near impossible to pry it out of their hands. JWR is one of the few people who has the right idea in my book.

I’m not a fan of any party or political groups, I’m a fan of the truth no matter who it hurts or helps, and that’s what good journalists should provide and from what I see most of them still do that (its the fringe ones on the internet and a few major stuff from other countries like RT and Fox that dont)… its just the rhetoric against them thats heated up since the internet came into the picture, since people in general have become more partisan and divided (especially because of the culture wars), and since politicians of all stripes have gotten more bold in blaming the media for their own problems. Truth tellers get the most enemies in this world, and theres few truths more true than that.

Maybe I’m in a niche and vast minority of Canadians, since most would probably be indifferent, just plain hate them, or have been brainwashed by “alternative news media” on the internet or by partisan politicians, but I’d hate to see the CBC go away.

273,Warren Kinsella,My latest: Trudeau is likelier to win,2019-08-12 07:01:00,Warren,,"Dief’s jowls jiggled. His brows bristled.

“I’ve always been fond of dogs,” the Conservative leader declared, and the assembled media throng — the ones who had just informed him that Gallup had him losing, badly, to the Liberals — leaned ever closer.

“And they are the one animal that knows the proper treatment to give to poles.”

The ink-stained wretches burst out laughing, and scribbled away in their notebooks. Dief the Chief had conjured a political quote for the ages.

He was sort-of right, too, about the polls (and poles). Diefenbaker would go on to win, big time, shocking the pollsters and the pundits alike. And 1957 would become one of the biggest upsets in Canadian political history, with the Tories ending nearly a quarter-century of Grit rule.

In the intervening years, plenty of politicos have repeated Dief’s quotable quote, or offered up a variation on it: “The only poll that matters is the one on Election Day.”

And both bromides are true: some pollsters get it wrong. Often. Nowadays, with voters getting harder and harder to reach — because many of them use only cellphones, and cellphone numbers aren’t readily found in directories, like landlines used to be — pollsters are making mistakes. Sometimes big ones.

Remember that 2012 National Post headline, declaring: “PQ headed to comfortable majority,” based on Forum’s numbers? The one just before voting day? It was wrong.

Remember BC in 2013, when pollsters said the NDP was nearly ten points ahead of the BC Liberals? Well, they weren’t. On election night, the BC Liberals were five points ahead of their rivals — and won.

How about the time the Angus Reid Group issued a news release flatly stating the fledgling Wildrose Party would form a majority government in 2014? Remember that? Well, they didn’t. The Alberta PCs did. Handily.

And so on, and so on. Brexit: no one really saw it coming. Trump: ditto. Prime Minister Tom Mulcair, what happened?

The definition of insanity, goes the cliche, is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result. And here we all go again, with the commentariat eyeballing the polling entrails, and declaring that Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are in a so-called dead heat, with Scheer slightly ahead. No party is likely to form a majority in 2019, sayeth the punditocracy.

But are they really in a dead heat? And is a majority truly out of reach?

This writer is not so sure. As much as it pains me to say so, a Trudeau win — minority and maybe even majority — presently seems likely. Here’s why: it’s math.

Even though Trudeau may be behind Scheer by a few points — and even though he’s far less popular than he was in 2015, and he has both the Greens and the NDP working busily to steal away votes — Trudeau remains relatively popular where it counts most: seat-rich Central Canada.

Aggregates of several recent polls indicate Trudeau is comfortably in the lead in Ontario and Québec. Based upon those two provinces alone, the Grits may claim as many as 120 seats. Add in Atlantic Canada, where Trudeau has been dominant for months, and the Grit seat count could easily grow to 145 seats.

Could Trudeau win 10 seats in British Columbia? He certainly could. That gets him to 155. Throw in a few territorial and prairie seats — say, eight — and he’s at 163 seats. That’s short of the 170 he’d need to form a majority, true.

But with Green Party leader Elizabeth May openly admitting that she’d be willing to prop up a second Trudeau government, the Liberals may well get all that they need. At that point, all of Andrew Scheer’s dominance in the West won’t matter — because the places where Scheer dominates simply have fewer seats.

If John Diefenbaker was still here, he’d likely admit that polls do, in fact, sometimes matter. But campaigns matter way more.

In ’57, Dief simply campaigned better in those final days. And that’s why he won big.

Seats are allocated by population and the notional polls are by population. Scheer’s problem is he is way ahead in the West and a little behind in Central Canada. Because of first past the post, that means his vote doesn’t translate well into seats.

I have to fully agree here that the math looks positively great for a second term for Trudeau Liberals. Moreover, the Wild Rose Party leader allowed herself to be coopted when she could have stood strong in opposition and won at the polls.
Frankly, the Wild Rose Party was one of the biggest political gaffs in Canadian political history.

I feel sorry for Andrew Scheer this time round. He is a nice person & Con leader. Whereas I did not like Steven Harper one bit I do like Scheer.

Yep. I’ve been telling my Tory friends for a while that the math just isn’t there for them, especially since Scheer would need, at the bare minimum, 160 seats to form a government.

The collapse of the NDP in Quebec will only help the Grits there. Any Bloc gains will, I suspect, come at the expense of the Tories in large degree. Trudeau won’t repeat the clean sweep of Atlantic Canada but I doubt Scheer can count on much more than maybe 7 or 8 seats there. And since suburban and urban Ontario are currently pissed at Doug Ford, there’s little chance of cracking the 905 and zero chance at the 416.

The Tories need to be much further ahead in the popular vote than they are now. Unless the Grits botch the campaign Wizard-style and Scheer walks on water, I don’t see it happening.

IF the polls are right — and consistent — mid-sixty+ percent of respondents have identified this as a change election. That means votes translating over to the CPC, the only likely alternative at forming government. I doubt the NDP will come from third place to win. But it has been done before.

The Liberals are already softening in Quebec. I expect the Scheer likability factor to work in their favour. Hence, I’m sticking with my prediction for a CPC majority. (Nobody liked Harper in 2006 and he still managed a minority.)

Derek,

What a huge laugh to see English Canada all out of joint over that one. Funny how that same gang couldn’t give two-shits about royally shafting Quebec in 1982.

To that bunch I say well, have at it. But remember that decentralization is the card to play in Quebec cause it wins elections — not to mention otherwise unobtainable votes. The top CPC Quebec strategist is not far short of a genius. He or she KNOWS Quebec very well. I tip my hat to that person.

Liberals know the Canada formula.

1) Take Power from the West and Atlantic, and give to Ontario and Quebec.
2) Take money from Ontario and the West and give to Quebec and Atlantic.
3) 3 of the 4 Regions are happy with this arrangement.
4) Screw the remaining 4th Region.

This is potentially THE most consequential election in Canadian history. Yet probably 70% of Canadians don’t know it.

An LPC minority or majority means Bill 69 and the tanker ban remain in place. And of course the LPC will abandon the trans mountain expansion when the protesters in BC start to block it.

And no change to Equalization.

Gord,

The doomsday clock is ticking. People haven’t a clue that once Alberta decides to walk, they’ll do it long before we do. No Alberta government, of any stripe, will put up with the EF as is, period. So, the federal parties better get it in gear fast before Alberta walks.

As for the tanker ban, the CPC will fail Alberta. They like far too much the idea of AB and BC seats. However, if Horgan gets voted out, then watch for sudden CPC flexibility.

We will certainly be significantly closer to dissolution if the LPC wins. Many I converse with are understandably skeptical if not downright contemptuous of the possibility.

I would point out that whatever happens won’t gapoen overnight. It took 18 years for the American Revolution to reach its end.

This downturn is entirely the government’s doing. That’s the difference between it and all the other downturns except when PET and Lalonde brought in the NEP in order to guarantee central Canada below market prices fir Alberta oil at the expense of Alberta.

And that downturn was greatly exacerbated by a crash in oil prices not long after the NEP was installed and a huge spike in interest rates that accelerated the contraction of the economy. Were it not for unprecedented low rates these days the damage to the AB and SK economies would have been far more sudden and immediate than it has been.

Those who either work in or rely on the O&G industry are okay with a downturn in prices and opportunities due to global phenomenon. This downturn is 100% due to feckless, cowardly, and/or contemptible actions by politicians whose franchise was given to them by others.

I fear you are correct in your prediction.

$1.2B to get CBC support.
$0.6B to get remaining media support.
$4.0B in pre-election funding announcements
while passing law to prevent opposition from using their own money to campaign.

With all of this, I doubt anyone would have had a chance.
It’s sad what became of our democracy in such a short time.

The narrative told by Barton and Wherry is like it was dictated by Butts and Telford, leaving out most of the important facts. The most important of which was how Trudeau and the PMO block the full public testimony of most of the individuals involved in the scandal. CBC was and is actively participately in the coverup.

The piece in The National last night also glossed over the fact that JWR was moved from the position of AG after she refused to overrule the Director of Public Prosecutions decision that SNC-Lavalin was not entitled to a deferred prosecution agreement. This is a key part of the story, but the CBC buried it last night.
WTF.

As long as JWR is bound by cabinet secrecy, we’ll only hear one side of the story – the side that does indeed appear to provide “false, self-serving/one-sided and inaccurate accounts”.

Here’s what I don’t like: Trudeau’s ridiculous position that has absolutely zero credibility that they did nothing wrong when everyone even only remotely detached from the PMO knows in fact that they did precisely the opposite.

Then there’s JWR conveniently cloaking herself behind cabinet confidence when it suits her purposes and being remarkably more candid when she deems it appropriate.

In short, both of them are real politicians and they each have it down to a science. There is no righteous saint in this story, not by a long shot. The hypocrisy is mind-numbing but not necessarily astonishing.

Reply



Ronald O'Dowd says: 

August 12, 2019 at 9:38 pm

And I would add this: the Prime Minister has repeatedly in public forums pronounced himself on matters post JWR leaving the AG-J portfolio. Everyone understands the limitations of the waiver. However, given the PM’s repeated actions, IMHO, it’s now time for JWR to get a fresh instructive legal opinion and release its main conclusion publicly as to cabinet confidence. Without that, her assertions remain at the very least open to legitimate questioning, which nevessarily can’t help but undermine, to some extent, her credibility. She says it’s not fair. So, do something about it.

A Liberal-friendly book released just shortly before the federal election campaign and the scheduled release of JWR’s book? Mere coincidence, I’m sure.

“Unfortunately, I think Canadians care about this as much as they cared about Harper being in contempt of Parliament.”

Except that Harper was only found ‘guilty’ of being in contempt of Parliament by his political opponents, and only because he was a minority government (and, infuriatingly, he not only refused to bow to their legislative demands but continued to govern as if he had a majority). Justin Trudeau is the very first Prime Minister found guilty of breaking a federal statute, is he not?

Now that the RCMP are finally involved, it’s a whole different ball game…

Enough is enough with the “aw, shucks, we can do better in the future” nonsense. The man-boy we elected PM four years ago reveals himself time and again as completely tone deaf to anything that doesn’t support his narrative. All questions on the ethics commissioner’s report were deflected with tired old talking points long since disproven, and he truly looked like he was hiding something.

People have been looking for bogeymen that are somehow trying to sabotage the country in the run-up to the election, or have the opinion that all politicians are ultimately the same. Make no mistake, folks: JT is the true bogeyman, an arrogant politician like no other, proven to have only the best interests of his inner circle in mind, not the voting public. And he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.

On discovering such a charlatan, voters have only one option: throw the bum out!

Awkward? Because JT brushed off bland Scheer and went scurrying away? Run Justin run. Scheer said what many Canadians are thinking: the PM is lying to Canadians. The PM is covering up the truth, and has prevented nine witnesses from co-operating with the Ethics Commissioner. This is not good: our PM, investigated by the RCMP. And please do not reference, in any way, Stephen Harper. Because this is about the here and now. Not way back then. JT: doing politics differently? How about doing politics, worse!

Pretty straightforward boys and girls. Justin “accepts the report and takes full responsibility”. What he is messaging is “I’m the PM and it’s my job to make sure it won’t happen again. In the future.” How very noble and honorable.

His other message is “I disagree with the findings…”. What Justin is messaging is, “I did nothing wrong with those things in the report that infer I did.”

See what he’s trying to do here?

So, if he said he “didn’t direct his staff to pressure JWR”, how soon will he be firing Jerry ‘BFF’ Butts? Ben Chin? Katie Telford? Let’s get after it Justin! Start here by showing your rogue staff will be held accountable!

Oh, and for all the Trudeau LAVscam sympathizers, MP sychophants and complicit media who kept demanding and asking JWR and Philpot to break cabinet confidentiality and spill the beans, given that no less than 9 people on Trudeau’s side and in his circle REFUSED to provide information to the Ethics Commissioner, will they now speak and share as so many demanded JWR and Jane P do?

He was an American lawyer, and chief counsel to the US Army. He died long ago. But even from the grave, even after so many years have gone by, Welch has something to important to say about the sordid, seamy scandal known as LavScam.

The Ethics Commissioner had something to say, too, as it turned out. And this week, he said it: “The authority of the Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. [Jody] Wilson-Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”

That sentence – and the commissioner’s finding that Justin Trudeau and his thugs did, indeed, conspire to stop the criminal prosecution of a Québec-based donor to his party, SNC-Lavalin – has myriad implications for many people. Here are just a few.

• Andrew Scheer: When the LavScam story broke in the Globe and Mail, the Conservative Party leader was criticized by some in his own party for demanding Justin Trudeau’s resignation. It is clear, now, he was right to do so. It’s also equally clear that Scheer need not worry himself about Trudeau’s puerile threat to sue him for defamation. Truth, after all, is an absolute defence to a libel claim.

• Jody Wilson-Raybould: Everything that the former Attorney-General said – and Trudeau petulantly refused to let her say all she had to say – was also true. All of it. She was, in fact, pressured by Trudeau and ten of his minions (including his Minister of Finance) to cut a sweetheart deal for SNC-Lavalin on 22 separate occasions over a four-month period. She spoke the truth. And, in so doing, Wilson-Raybould revealed more integrity and courage than Trudeau could ever hope to possess in ten lifetimes.

• Trudeau’s Office: His most-powerful aide, Gerald Butts, resigned at the height of the LavScam scandal. At the time, it was unclear why. Not now. Butts should tender his resignation again – as should Katie Telford, Ben Chin, Mathieu Bouchard, Elder Marques and others in PMO. Bouchard and Marques, both lawyers, additionally deserve the scrutiny of the relevant law societies for their role in LavScam.

• The Mounties: It is known that the RCMP seized Butts’ government-issue laptop and cell phone when he first resigned. It is also known that Butts, Telford and the others “lawyered up,” and retained counsel for an anticipated criminal probe. And then…nothing. While Scheer and others demanded a criminal investigation, the RCMP gave every indication they were having an extended, collective nap. The Ethics Commissioner’s extraordinary report will force them awake. Or should.

• The Media: For various sycophantic media voices – most notably the Toronto Star’s Susan Delacourt and HuffPo’s Althing Raj – the SNC-Lavalin affair has been a trifling matter, and Wilson-Raybould deserved to be exiled by Trudeau and his lackeys. The damning Ethic Commissioner’s report should oblige Delacourt, Raj and other Trudeau-flatterers to radically revise that assessment.

But what, one might ask, of Joseph Nye Welch? How is LavScam relevant to him, and vice-versa?

Watching Justin Trudeau simultaneously accept the Ethics Commissioner’s report – and then condemn it, all dewy-eyed sincerity – Welch might have said what he famously said to Joseph McCarthy, during the Democratic Senator’s hunt for communists and subversives.

“Until this moment, I think I have never really gauged your recklessness,” Welch might’ve said to Trudeau. “You’ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?”

While Scheer and others demanded a criminal investigation, the RCMP gave every indication they were having an extended, collective nap. The Ethics Commissioner’s extraordinary report will force them awake. Or should.</p>
<p>• <strong>The Media: </strong>For various sycophantic media voices – most notably the Toronto Star’s Susan Delacourt and HuffPo’s Althing Raj – the SNC-Lavalin affair has been a trifling matter, and Wilson-Raybould deserved to be exiled by Trudeau and his lackeys. The damning Ethic Commissioner’s report should oblige Delacourt, Raj and other Trudeau-flatterers to radically revise that assessment.</p>
<p>But what, one might ask, of Joseph Nye Welch? How is LavScam relevant to him, and vice-versa?</p>
<p>Watching Justin Trudeau simultaneously accept the Ethics Commissioner’s report – and then condemn it, all dewy-eyed sincerity – Welch might have said what he famously said to Joseph McCarthy, during the Democratic Senator’s hunt for communists and subversives.</p>
<p>“Until this moment, I think I have never really gauged your recklessness,” Welch might’ve said to Trudeau. “You’ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?”</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau, at long last, does not.</p>

I can’t wait till he is gone. Keep up the good work on behalf of the country.

I wish Chrétien was still running this country. Quite likely Canada’s favourite former PM.

I stayed in Alberta because of his pipeline approval press conference. Where he approved Line 3 replacement, TransMountain, Energy East but said no to Northern Gateway. ( I was between jobs at the time, so this press conference really affected my decision)

I made a decision on my future on this, only to find out Energy East was to be intentionally frustrated by his administration after this press conference. Only to find out his frustrations of TransMountain had resulted in Kinder Morgan to pulling the plug. which resulted in the state to purchase it… Bravo.

He messes with people lives and then joyfully jokes that he doesn’t know what he can do to make Albertans happy. The easy answer is quit obstructing with peoples lives.

I forget how some old school political strategist summed it up, but the metaphor was something like, “when your political opponent is down, step on his neck.”

Keep up the political pressure, and perhaps the radical centrist, Mr Rogers replica will win the next election.

253,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: a Prime Minister to all, not a few",2019-08-25 05:45:00,Warren,,"The bar isn’t much to look at.

It’s on the tougher side of downtown, in a place where you cross the street when you see a couple guys coming your way.

There’s a big marquee out front, announcing its name, and a pair of weathered wooden doors that are open to all, but not all dare step inside.

No liquor licence. Envelopes stuffed with bills, handed over to the cops, are all that keep it open.

Whenever there’s a raid, the bar’s owners will sometimes get tipped off. Not always, but sometimes. The raids happen, ostensibly, because people gather there – people who dare not speak their name out loud.

Their sin? Dancing. The city doesn’t want them to dance together.

In the early morning hours of June 28, the cops raid the place again. There are uniformed officers outside, and some plainclothes officers inside, posing as patrons.

The cops go after one of the women in the bar, a regular. They push her and strike her. She gets mad and pushes back. They assault her some more.

A crowd has gathered out on the sidewalk, watching what the cops are doing to the woman. A cop brings his baton down on her head and she starts to bleed, a lot.

She’s mad, but not just at the cops, who are punching and kicking the bar’s patrons. As she’s being pushed into the back of a police van, the woman yells at the crowd: “Why don’t you guys do something?”

And they do. Just like that, just like a light being switched on, they do. Remembering, perhaps, all the years of bullying and beatings and actual murders, they erupt. They hit back.

By the end, they’ve trapped the cops inside the bar. And, later on, it’ll take dozens more cops to rescue them.

The bar isn’t in your town, but it could be. The raid, or something like it, doesn’t really happen in your town anymore – but it used to.

And the kind of people who would go there? They’re found in your town. Lots of them.

The bar really existed. Stonewall’s, in Lower Manhattan in New York City. Anyone could go there to dance and have a drink, but only one of kind person generally did so.

Homosexuals. Gays, lesbians. The ones who – in those days, and in these days, too – weren’t allowed to dance together. Or come together. Or even, you know, be.

The ones who would be denied jobs, or hotel rooms, because of the way they were. The ones who would be often beaten and sometimes killed for being who they were.

Their uprising that June night – that’s what that lesbian who the cops were beating called it, an uprising and not a riot – would later bear the name of the bar: Stonewall. Every year, bit by bit, in cities and towns all over, there would be a commemoration of what happened at Stonewall’s bar that night. Remembering.

In time, the remembrances bore another name. A name that described what they were really about.

Pride. Pride in being, at long last, in being who they are. Being how God made them.

Now, I don’t know Andrew Scheer all that well. He’s a family man, he goes to church. If he stayed that way, nobody would really care what he thinks about the various Pride events that happen across Canada every Summer. He’d just be another guy.

But he’s not just another guy. He’s not a nobody. He’s the leader of the Conservative Party, and he’s running to be Prime Minister.

When you’re a Prime Minister, you don’t get to pick and choose which Canadians you represent. You represent all of us, or you represent none of us.

So, I ask Andrew Scheer: are you going to be one of the guys on the sidewalk, watching and not doing anything about what you see? Or, are you going to step forward, and say: “I support you. I will help you. I will protect you. You are no better or no worse than me.”

That’s what the Pride stuff is about, really: equality. Support. Humanity.

Get off the damn sidewalk, Andrew.

Fair enough up to a point. He should be punching back with an unequivocal statement on where he stands on SSM. Harper nipped this one in the bud by stating firmly and openly it was a closed issue. But I am really getting tired of the significance so many gays, etc. are claiming attaches to attending or not attending their blessed parades. They aren’t just about equality and humanity, they’re also about open displays of sexuality, which is simply not to everyone’s taste regardless of whose sexuality is being celebrated.

Nicole says:

There are no expressions of sexuality at a pride parade that are any different from heterosexual couples holding hands in the streets or kissing in public. This talking point from homophobes trying to suggest that pride parades are like an orgy and OMG what if the kids see this is simply unacceptable and completely false.

Scheer is a Catholic who grew up in the 80s and 90s when LGBT issues became openly discussed and acknowledged. He is not old enough to pretend that his hesitancy has to do with how his generation was raised. Catholics his age are in very large numbers very accepting of same sex marriage, adoption etc. As it stands, his hesitancy looks like he is trying to placate the vocal religious minority that populates a large number of CPC supporters instead of acting as a leader for all Canadians. Warren is entirely correct here.

Sorry, Nicole. I have to disagree with you. I used to live in Toronto and attended a couple of Pride parades – back when the police were welcome. One year, there were men running around totally naked and the police looked the other way. If this was you or I walking down the streets of Toronto, we would have been arrested. So the parade allows for a double standard and I found it offensive. I stopped attending them.

Sheer has every right to stay away.

Peter,

Not everyone is entirely comfortable with aspects of pretty much anything in life. That’s a given. But it’s also conveniently beside the point in the proper exercise of true party leadership. A leader calls the top shots and sets the party’s tone: it’s a deliberate abdication of leadership not to represent Canadians at Pride events. Successive Conservative leaders cower behind the fear of their own membership rather than confidently dictating the party’s course. A real leader puts dissident members in their place. But it takes the best qualities of leadership to do something simply because it’s the right thing to do. Representing all Canadians is never a half-hearted, conditional or qualified effort. To my knowledge, that’s the lesson MacKay, Harper and Scheer have failed to learn to this day. Being genuinely prime ministerial, in all that it entails, continues to escape those otherwise sentient individuals. Excuses no longer cut the mustard in 2019. They simply aren’t good enough or even remotely acceptable for a potential PM of all Canadians.

This includes things like Remembrance Day ceremonies, 9/11 Memorials, and dedication of Afghan War Memorials.

Is there anything such as a National Pride parade and flag raising, or are those all local events? I imagine this is why not a single PM had attended a Pride Parade until this corrupt PM did to distract from his general incompetence.

I had an outdoor gig to play back in 1979 where the RCMP drove a marked police cruiser with requisite cherries on top right into the middle of the field in Vincent Massy Park where
my music peers were lounging on the grass listening to my band pumping out 10,000 watts & having a good time.

It’s not a Pride story but I fully get why gays, lesbians, straights, et cetera don’t appreciate or want police interloping on their cohort of friends when they are socializing, or having an outing/party, or gathering at a bar/concert for entertainment purposes.

As long as I live I will never forget the RCMP police cruiser being driven right into the middle of the Vincent Massy Band Shell field just so that the gathered crowd would be intimidated by their menacing presence & perceived threat of police brutality if anyone stepped out-of-line.

Police are often menacing to everyone whether gay or not. Police have always been typically aggressive towards anyone that is non-conformist or rebellious politically or socially.

Today, pretty much all police departments have learned to respect difference from their own perceptions of social norms & mores. Back in 1979 things were far different from today. And back in the Stonewall Bar era it was even worse than 1979 was for acts of brutality by police.

The Watts Riots were prototypical of that era of police brutality.

It’s not mandatory for Muslim Lib MPs because of religious beliefs to attend Pride parades & that’s ok. But it should be same for all.
As well, many in LGBQT community see they’re being used for photo ops by Trudeau & LPC and as a political weapon, they resent it and don’t attend Pride parades because of it. Also lots of us have family & friends in these groups and resent being marginalized by hate from Liberals, because we & they don’t agree with some of the vulgarity on display and choose not to support it.

I’m presuming you & WK are saying the same would hold true for an equally qualified person of any faith whose beliefs do not allow him to participate in a Pride parade?

J.H.,

Nope. He or she can aspire and even become PM.

Where your argument misses the boat is in defining capacity: the PM is not there in a private, personal capacity. He or she attends in a civil capacity, which should be completely divorced from one’s religious beliefs. He or she attends such events as a secular, non-religious representative of the Canadian people at large.

That’s why the Americans have separation of church and state. Personal, strongly held religious beliefs are not meant in the Constitution to animate the comportment of a civil official exercising his or her powers of office. That’s why there’s no state religion in the U.S. but I digress.

“The diff since you’ve obviously missed it is they: a) aren’t a party leader and b) aren’t aspiring to serve as prime minister. ”

The Prime Minister is also an MP, and why should a Muslim be excluded from becoming PM for his religious beliefs? Religious beliefs are much like like personal ones, and neither should keep a normal person from qualifying for office.

You’re saying that people should be *forced* to attend Pride Parades, and that’s just PC bullying. The CBC just published a story where a prominent gay activist claimed that they didn’t even want Andrew Scheer to attend anyway. Why should he force his way into a useless, exploitative photo-op with people who don’t want him there anyway?

Agreed Fred. It seems that under the criteria that Ron & WK appear to be laying out, in the future, if a Muslim aspired to be PM of Canada, under their scenario, because of his religious beliefs , he would be disqualified as not meeting Trudeau’s national standard.

Well, quite obviously, if organizers don’t want Scheer, or any future CPC leader there (think MacKay), then, of course, common sense dictates that they not attend. Who goes to any type of event when a request has previously been made that you not attend?

I could not agree more–if people change so should those among, that wish to gain global contacts and thereby benefit from being in office. Now, lets not forget that —‘all politicians who aspire for provincial or federal office are doing it more for themselves than any so called claim of public service. Its just too obvious and silly to claim otherwise. With that in mind, lets look at the associations of anti-science, anti-history, anti-gay-, anti-human-rights-groups/associations/and-education-anti-environment-anti-small-business-(which curtails multinational control)-anti-rights for FN/women/the-Constitutional-laws-that-protect-most……Care to answer why this list not only existed and was acted on but why you (and the media) continue to play out as though none of these truth are real —and the decade they played out –didn’t happen as per your refusal to air and of the real conservative RECORD-to date???????????

Andrew Scheer is a social conservative. Why is it any surprise that he doesn’t attend Gay Pride events? If he did, he would only do so for votes, and that would show a lack of principle. He has no desire to change Canada’s laws regarding marriage, so why is this even an issue? Do we demand that social liberal attend pro-life events?

I have to wonder to what extent a similar line of thinking explains the recent rise in popularity of the Greens, especially among people who don’t see May’s sympathies for Trudeau (I agree with you on that). Is it because there has been a rise in the priority people are giving to the climate change issue, or because the Greens represent “None of the above” for them?

I doubt he will attend any Pride events. He’s not wanted, and he would be loudly scorned and berated by the SJW crowd unmercifully if he did. That’s the way things are these days. I am sure there are a good number of his supporters who wouldn’t attend the parades either, for whatever reason. These events have become a political litmus test, and your attendance is mandatory, or else.

By my reckoning, showing up at local Pride Parades has done zero to tangibly help the LGBTQ community. Legislative changes, and basically getting out of their way so they can succeed, is what helps people. Pride Parades are rarely (any more) marches or demonstrations to advocate for specific changes; they are merely a community celebration.

However, given that most in the LGBTQ community would not vote Conservative anyway, these parades are also an opportunity for those already opposed to Conservatives to attack Conservative policies in completely unrelated areas. That’s why the Libs, NDPs, and Greens jump at the opportunity to attend. They achieve their coveted virtue-signalling (again, achieving nothing of consequence for the LGBTQ community), while also allowing them to rally behind anti-Conservative messages.

Now, all of that said, it would be helpful if Scheer made direct and specific repudations of his 2005 comments regarding gay marriage. Of course, many Liberals (including current cabinet ministers) also voted against gay marriage back then – but they aren’t running to be PM.

Scheer would do well to push a reset button with his war room. One of the reasons Harper lost was his unwillingnness\inability to express human compassion for various social issues. Justin Trudeau seeks out compassion issues – words come out of him just like s..t going through a goose. Whether or not he believes what he’s saying, he does touch a feeling with many Canadians. Scheer would be wise to make a few comments about how his own world view has changed….. These comments cost nothing but do serve to speak to the human side of political leadership. If Scheer and his war room are unable to do this, they’ll likely lose this election – to the detriment of Canada.

“One of the reasons Harper lost was his unwillingnness\inability to express human compassion for various social issues. ”

I would agree with that assessment. ‘People skills’ were never his strong point. In fact, he never really wanted to be a politician at all: he was happiest as a policy wonk under Preston Manning (the two of them actually wrote the Clarity Bill before it was commandeered by the Liberals). Harper did one term as an MP, apparently did not enjoy it enough to run for a second term, but was then ‘drafted’ into being a party leader…and the rest is history.

(at least that’s what my memory tells me)

At any rate, I’ve seen leaders who were telegenic, personable and dumb as a post beat people who were superior in almost every other respect. As a group, we voters really aren’t that bright, are we?

New Litmus Test for those seeking to become Prime Minister of Canada. This is in addition to the requirement that you are pro choice and totally intolerant of any opposing view based on conscience or religious belief.

1. Articulating that you respect the law as it stands and will ensure the human rights of all Canadians is not enough.
2. Must attend one or more Gay Pride Parades.
3. Must show you are enjoying yourself at the parade by using a squirt gun at least once.

Those not willing to comply need not apply for the job no matter their qualifications. Those in compliance can apply no matter their qualifications (even high school drama teachers)

Listening on the radio today, I heard that many Pride organizations require attending politicians to sign-off on some list of requirements in order to attend.

We live in a democracy. There are other parties you can vote for if you do not like Scheer and the Conservatives. You can try to drop rhetorical bombs on Conservatives as Hitler tried to blitz London. But you will find it will only increase Conservative resolve. Conservatives are not going to surrender over this.

We have seen these gay pride people commit indecent exposure in front of CHILDREN during their pride parades. This is a serious criminal offence. There is no reason why any rational politician should support this kind of illegal behavior.

Both Tories and Grits have dissenters from the official party position on the issues of SSM and abortion. This has been well established going back about 30 years. Leaders on both sides have been inconsistent while Canada experienced major social changes…. Which in fairness actually mirrors the attitudes of many Canadians. Both parties embarrass themselves if they attack the other on these issues. Stones / glass houses etc….

The only difference here is that PM Zoolander’s incompetent team of desperate, frequent losers chose to re-open these wounds… they sense that after all the disappointments, lies and failures, they have nothing left to sell Canadians in their final 7 weeks in the spotlight. The Tories didn’t start this fight because they know better and frankly, they have some class.

Went to Ontario a few months ago and all the outspoken progressive friends couldn’t let it go that Scheer has a personal belief of choosing to be pro-life.

Doesn’t matter that Scheer says that this political issue has been settled and isn’t interested in opening the abortion debate out of the bottle.

It was like wow… there aren’t any social issues in Federal Politics to scare voters with anymore. (As shown by a Harper government not Pursuing any such movements .) And yet the Trudeau brain trust had successfully got the attention of the electorate regarding Scheer over this.

This issue was to be the ticket to get re-elected. Time to hit the reset button on the campaign, I sense the start of 2006 Paul Martin style campaign is being emulated by Team Trudeau.

Trudeau has created such political uncertainty in Alberta, that Foreign Investors have fled. Vanished. Poof. So Trudeau’s Team handling the economy is the problem.

So Compassion you say? He is direct reason Energy East failed to become reality.

I know people selling property in Alberta cuz they think Trudeau is going to win. I have known people who have purchased property, cuz land values are so low and don’t think it can go any lower. I just bought, at a steep discount and am still very nervous if the property will ever be liquid.

Compassion as in extending EI benefits. Yippeee! That’s a Trudeau the solution. More EI when people as just asking for the dignity to work. This PMO is anything but compassionate.

Have you ever been unemployed and on the government dole? Government likes do these things called skills programs. Which are contracted cash grab for someone, I assume party insiders. (It’s criminal actually.) They are so bad, they do a poor job telling you how to write a resume. Then they want to know if you have found work on your own accord so it can be marked down in their success metric.

What could Trudeau possibly do to be so compassionate? Hand Bombardier money without undoing the Dual class structure that is keeping the stock suppressed.

What I have learned about far left governments, is there well intentioned programs do more damage than good. Especially programs that Trudeau creates which exclude people who pay too much tax.

Downturns are common, a 4 year downturn, capital flight when the rest of world has increased their drilling activity only happened once before. It was the NEP.

The thing is, we aren’t asking for a handout. We are asking for the government to quit being obstructionist. Quit destroying investor confidence in Canadian resource sector.

And finally no one in Canada should have to beg a government to stop this behaviour, so we may have the dignity of work. This is a very dark chapter in Canada, and outside of the Prairies it doesn’t even seem to register.

As much as I would argue that Alberta has been far too slow to get on the diversification train — I think you are bang on target with this assessment.

But the real problem is that we’re a federation and as such BC, Quebec and New Brunswick hold a de facto veto over pipeline expansion. So, IMHO, even if Scheer gets in with a majority, how do you unscramble those eggs without losing tons of seats? For Scheer, that REALLY means BC seats.





Ronald O'Dowd says:

Gord,

I think Ottawa needs to recognize a few things: a) Trudeau has put us in the position of owning Trans Mountain. b) That means he, or his successor, has an iron-clad obligation to get it done. c) To get past the de facto BC government veto, there needs to be a federal binding referendum in Alberta and BC. IF it passes with 50% + 1, then BC has to fold her cards and give way. If not, Horgan must immediately go to the people for a renewed mandate, otherwise he can no longer speak credibly for BC. It’s my sense that re-election will be an uphill battle for him, to say the least.

The age old ‘abortion debate’ is the most laughable old canard in Canadian politics each & every electoral round since the HarpyCONs darken the doorways of Parliament.

Harpy himself stated unequivocally that the Conservative Party would not entertain any debate on the matter whatsoever. The religious right literally regurgitates this religious tripe every electoral round like all the right wing religious zealots do upon Easter every year too.

Abortion is a constitutionally protected Charter Right in Canada. HarpyCONs & Ford Nation know that neither the federal level HarpyCONs or provincial level so-called ‘Progressive Conservatives’ will engage in any sort of debate about ‘abortion’ in Canada, or provincially.

Partisan zealotry sucks but partisan religious zealotry sucks even more, man.

Their aim is two-fold: to get the one-third of supporters who plan not to support them this time back on board and to get still loyal Liberals to not sit this one out. That’s what has them positively shaking: they have nightmares of getting Hillaryed in Ontario and believe me, it’s coming.

Ronald, one website projects the Liberals winning 72 Ontario seats; the Conservatives, 43; and the NDP, 5. Sounds about right. I don’t see JT getting Hillaryed in Ontario.

Douglas,

One of us is right, the other wrong. Not for me to arrogantly say 100% that I’m right. I will leave a little wiggle room but I remain confident that the polls will underestimate CPC support and far more importantly, momentum. (Let’s also see if NANOS hits another home run.) Trudeau has a track record: some good, some really not good. Actual voters will decide and distribute the egg on our faces accordingly.

Douglas W says: 

September 2, 2019 at 7:41 pm

Ronald, I concur: the polls are underestimating the strength of the Conservatives, and I also believe the pollsters’ numbers have not factored in the Conservatives’ ground game: apparently strong in numbers, and flushed with cash. I also wonder how strong the Liberals’ ground game will be? And do their supporters have the same passion as they did in 2015? Finally, the unexpected wild cards: a damaging comment from JW-R or Dr. JP. Something drawn from the V-A Norman case? Something, that reaffirms the ethics (or lack there of) of the Trudeau inner circle. It’s going to be one heck of a heck of a campaign.

“Finally, the unexpected wild cards: a damaging comment from JW-R or Dr. JP. Something drawn from the V-A Norman case? ”

I’ve been thinking the same (especially about Norman). But there’s one more potential factor: the Chinese. What if, God forbid, they decided to lash out at Trudeau by executing one of our hostages? Wouldn’t put it past them, not at all.

Douglas,

JWR has fervently stood behind her limited CC and SCP waiver. I think she needed a more up to date legal opinion. But I digress. In any event, she could only drop a very limited bombshell in the campaign given her up until now respect for those imposed parameters. I don’t see her having the margin for manoeverability that’s required to take Trudeau down with a nuclear blast. But I could be wrong.

Ronald, if Charlie Angus were to take over, there would be a huge momentum shift to the NDP; Charlie would be shaking things up, fast; and Mr. Singh would be a very distant memory. I get your point; and I know hockey is not politics, but years ago the NJ Devils fired their coach, only weeks before the Stanley Cup playoffs (who ever did that before?), and went on to win the Stanley Cup. Make a bold move, and don’t look back. This is what the NDP needs to do. Will they? Nope. Totally surprised that the caucus is willing to go over the cliff.

Unfortunately race will play out, especially in the privacy of the voting booth. Reminds me of the late 1980s when that young RCMP officer was finally allowed to wear his turban. He turned out to have had, by all reports, a fine career, and the country didn’t fall apart. Yet today, we’re still beset by these “debates.” None of the other federal leaders have shown any courage in these post-Bill 21 days. Too afraid of offending voters, especially in Quebec.

I think the ad is fine and the slogan is probably the best of the three. The Conservatives’ slogan is a real dud; clunky, forgettable, and too long. The Libs’ one is okay, at least short and to the point, and the Greens’ is alright too I think, although that start-stop aspect of it is a little strange to me.

As for race/religion issues, I’m sure that’s a factor for some people and probably more so in certain regions, but the seeming non-existence of the NDP for a year or more after his election as leader is a way bigger problem, and I don’t know they can be convincing enough to fill their own void.

I’m with you on that. I think Singh was vastly overrated and untested in the first place when the NDP membership went all gooey on him and elected him leader. But the bigger problem is that the Liberals, Greens and NDP are all essentially fishing in the same progressive pond these days, and it’s difficult to stand out when you’re doing that. JT got there first and Jagmeet just looks like a JT wannabe as a result.

You must have a different definition of the word ‘infrastructure’ than the rest of us. I think it means roads, bridges, tunnels, power grids, pipelines, sewer systems etc…what do *you* think it means?

Oh, and since the world will still be running on fossil fuels for at least three more decades, what *that* means is that the NDP really isn’t supporting the people working *right now* are they? They will be waiting to support these future ‘green’ workers, instead? Not really a recipe for electoral success right now, is it?

Infrastructure also includes subways and other transit, geothermal heating/cooling systems, expanded and electrified railways, hydro, wind and solar power plants and power grids.

As the world winds down fossil fuel use over the next three decades, economics dictates that the most expensive and most emitting sources will be eliminated first, like the oil sands.

So 14 racist NDP members are welcome into the Green Party.
At the same time, Liberal MP (Sangha) warns that his own Party is rife with Sikh extremists.

It appears once again the CPC is the only moderate party.

Wait, I thought only Albertans (or westerners) were racists, and everyone in Ontario eastward was enlightened and “woke” ? That stereotype was a such a timesaver for voters in the GTA and eastward!

My thinking is that a lot of people would do what I generally can be bothered to do, which is to skim headlines and conclude, “Wow, the NDP just completely bottomed out in NB and the Green Party just gained formal support, and what with the Greens’ success of late in NB and PEI, ouch for the NDP.”

Perhaps if NDP or whoever else beats this racism angle over the voters’ heads in the right way it will sink in. Myself, I’m more just confused about the point of the comments. I mean, I can see racism being an issue, but is their complaint that the NDP leadership didn’t give them any tools to help address those kinds of issues and reservations, or what? The rest of the expressed reasons for dissatisfaction makes more sense to me.

Good question. Mine is this: “if the NDP is full of racists, how did Jagmeet Singh even get elected to lead the party?”

For a moment let’s ignore the race issue. How is it advisable, possible, or even thinkable that a newly elected federal party leader not visit an entire Canadian province in the TWO YEARS between his leadership victory and the next federal election? This suggests astounding naivety and/or complete incompetence in the NDP leader’s office.

Discussions about race ought to be important when it comes to politics. More so in our relationships and how we conduct ourselves. Unfortunately, it’s easy to become apathetic if not desensitized to this sort of thing. While I agree with you Warren, I do not believe you, if that makes sense. Simply because Trudeau and the Liberals have consistently shown themselves to fail at ethics, and yet we see the polling needle inch its way back up to where it was with “The Natural Governing Party”. While it’s a bad reflection on each of these 14 individuals (and their crass political opportunism), and a bad lock for the Greens, given the response to Lavscam, and Liberals poised to be re-elected, I’m afraid we’re gonna get the government we deserve. (Where is electoral reform when we need it?)

Those 14 might be better at home in the Greens according to the Leger poll from June.

57% of Greens approve of limiting immigration as opposed to 44% of NDP voters.

Really stupid statement, although asides from Quebec, which due to its history has a strong issue with religious symbols, I believe NDP decline has less to do with Singh being a Sikh and more limited space on the political spectrum. Trudeau has swung the party far enough left there is little daylight between the NDP and Liberals, so why waste your vote on a party that has no hope on winning when you can get much of the same from a party that can win. If the Liberals were more centrist like in the Chretien/Martin era, I believe the NDP would be doing better, although still struggling, but not in danger of losing its official party status.

245,Warren Kinsella,Thirty-five years ago right now,2019-09-04 20:39:00,Warren,,"September 4, 1984: 35 years ago today, I was on an Air Canada flight from Ottawa, heading home to Calgary to start law school. The pilot came on the blower.

“For those of you who are wondering, we are hearing that the Liberal Party has lost every one of its seats,” he said. “And we have a new Conservative majority government.”

The plane erupted in cheers and applause – lots of it. Having just said goodbye to many of my Liberal friends at Ottawa polling stations, and having just finished working for a Liberal cabinet minister on the Hill, I slid further into my seat. A woman beside me noticed I wasn’t as deliriously happy as everyone else.

“I take it your friends have lost?” she asked.

“You could say that,” I said.

On the ground in Calgary, my Dad was there to collect me. We silently listened to John Turner’s concession speech on the way back to my folks’ home on the Bow River. Near the end, Turner said: “The people are always right.’

“I’m not so sure about that,” I responded, but – on reflection – I reckoned that Turner was indeed correct: the people are always right.

And the people had chosen Brian Mulroney, in record numbers. More than seventy-five per cent of eligible voters turned out to give Mulroney an astonishing 211 seats. The Liberals were reduced to a paltry 40 – only ten ahead of the New Democrats.

So began the Mulroney era, and a decade in the wilderness for the Liberal Party of Canada. It was an extraordinary decade, a time of great change, and it is hard to believe it all started 35 years ago today.

Not many in the media marked Mulroney’s September 4, 1984 triumph, and that is a shame. He changed Canada – not always for the good, but not entirely for the bad, either.

Meech Lake, Charlottetown, and assorted ministerial resignations, are always cited as the principal failures of the Mulroney era. But the former Conservative leader had successes, too: free trade, which his Liberal successor – my future boss, Jean Chretien – refused to undo. So, too, some of his major economic reforms, which arguably helped return the federation to balanced budgets and surpluses.

To not a few of us, his most singular achievement was his unflagging opposition to South Africa’s evil apartheid system. This placed him squarely against his closest conservative allies, Britain’s Margaret Thatcher and America’s Ronald Reagan. But Mulroney’s determination to end apartheid put him on the right side of history – and earned him the enduring friendship of Nelson Mandela.

Why does all this matter now, 35 long years later? Two reasons.

First, Mulroney extraordinary victory on September 4, 1984 – and the historic events that followed that day – should not be forgotten. Whether you approve of his tenure or not, Mulroney truly changed Canada.

The second reason really has nothing to do with Brian Mulroney at all. The second reason we should recall September 4 is this: when democratic political change comes, it sometimes comes in a way that is dramatic, decisive, and defining. It can be shocking.

That may be good, that may be bad. Depends on the team you belong to, I suppose.

One thing cannot be disputed, however:

To add to your note, Mulroney started an era of ending the intervening and/or nationalizing of private enterprise.

This modernization of the economy was later to be championed by Chretien, Martin and then Harper alike.

Direct Foreign Investment was understood to be a good thing.

Previous governments were obsessed to Tinker with the economy, that was beneficial in the short term. This tinkering however is unsustainable, (and proven unsustainable by the time we entered the 70’s) if playing the long game. Managed declines became the word of the year used by these interventionist.

These economic reforms were structurally painful for many as we modernized, and it took several decades to come to fruition. But we were getting there.

One Trudeau is undoing all that. Short term gains are being created, deficit spending during good times, propping up one company over the other. Picking favourites & winners.

Example, it may be very successful in the short term to help purchase homes for young Canadians. It’s anyone’s guess how this will distort the market in the long term.

Messing with markets can have substantial short term benefits. Like giving parents earning low incomes a lot of money. But long term can be much more devastating, as in the incentive to achieve is being abolished.

It’s what Trudeau is doing today, is what was finally rejected 35 years ago.

No idea why he would even waste his time going to Owen Sound. Seriously. Owen Sound Sun Times played down the booing(and his ridiculous waving at the booing crowd) because their boy Den Tandt used to be their editor. Their efforts to prop him up will be a waste of time, however. That riding will go green before it ever goes red.

I remember that day as well. I was a 12 year old living in suburban Dallas. My family had left Calgary in 1981 in response to the NEP. My dad, a self employed engineer, started a business focused on creating investment vehicles for Canadians to move their money to the US. With the defeat of the Liberals, he and two friends also living in exile from the “evil empire” (his words) decide to start a new business and give Canada another chance.

Free trade is the shining example of how opposition parties may screech that the sky will fall if a particular economic advancement occurs, but rarely is that the case. What the Liberals called a “blow to Canada” in the mid-80s was actually a very prescient harbinger of how world trade would eventually move.

Ironic that now it is the far right (in the U.S. mainly) who screeches against trade agreements and reciprocity.

Reply


Peter says: 

September 5, 2019 at 11:52 am

Not just the far right. A lot of people are coming to realize the answer to the self-destructive foolishness of autarky isn’t necessarily to make the whole world one big free trade zone. NAFTA has been a boon for Canada and the States, as has the EU economically for Europe, especially Northern Europe, but we’re talking about countries with similar tax and social structures (minimum wage, health & safety, etc.), uncorrupted judiciaries and belief in the rule of law. When you move outside those parameters, it gets murky. When free trade agreements are seen as tools to be manipulated politically (China) or merely statements of good intentions (Greece), it can go askew. Globalists tend to wax eloquently on the good vibes and harmony free trade brings, but in the end they are about competition, and there will be winners and losers. No politician can survive defending foreign winners against domestic losers. As to their role in promoting peace, there was probably more free trade in the world in 1914 then there had ever been or has been since. ‘Nuff said.

Like all rules-based systems, the whole WTO system depends on a certain level of buy-in by its member states in order to function properly and as intended. The problem is, countries like China aren’t really buying in. They’re scofflaws and free-riders. It creates an immense challenge as to how to deal with that. I don’t agree with Trump’s approach, but China has a lot to answer for, particularly in the area of intellectual property theft.

And the US is hardly the only victim. I recommend the book The Looting Factory, which has a chapter on how counterfeit Chinese goods and related smuggling by Chinese and Nigerian organized criminals have utterly destroyed Nigeria’s domestic textile industry. It’s disgraceful.

“Another example of something huge that Mulroney brought in that the Liberals ran against but left alone was the GST. ”

I wondered when someone was going to mention that. It was both of these things, free trade and the GST, Mulroney implemented to pull Canada back from the threat of economic collapse after the disastrous PET mandate, and he did it despite record-high interest rates crippling his efforts at debt repayment. People who whine, even today, about how Mulroney “added huge amounts of debt” to Canada don’t understand how tough it was to just to keep the government going ( oh sure, he could have shut down all government offices for a month or given the RCMP a month off without pay or closed all Canadian hospitals for a week and balanced the books that way, I suppose..)

He had his flaws, but overall history will be kind to him, I think. Stephen Harper, too.

Fred,

Harper’s tenure will be far more mitigated re: his record while he will obviously outshine Mulroney on ethics.

Harper had too much gonzo right-wing BS: long-form census, monkeying around with credible climate change science and his overall environmental approach. He thought he could cut ice just by going up North religiously ever year. Evidently not.

Reply


The Doctor says: 

September 6, 2019 at 12:03 pm

I’m biased, I’ll admit, but I think Harper made a similar mistake to what Trump’s making. As Paul Wells once put it, Harper loved “narrowcasting”, and he was enamoured of the Karl Rove school of political tactics. Related to that, Harper had nothing but contempt for Red Tories. It was the old Reformer in him that couldn’t let that go. So he convinced himself that he didn’t need Red Tories or defecting Blue Liberals for support. It was those people who were turned off by some of Harper’s more idiotic right-wing stuff (the long-form census idiocy being a perfect example). In the 2015 election, he totally lost the Red Tory/Blue Liberal vote. And if you’re a conservative party in Canada, as a general rule you need those people to vote for you in significant numbers in order to win. Just relying on the rural vote and far-right Goobers will not get you there.

Trump appears to be making a similar mistake down south, though of course his personality disorder makes it all the crazier and acute. He’s convinced himself that all he needs is his feral base. And of course he’d rather do that, because his base gives him the unconditional narcissistic supply that he so craves. But he needs more than just that base to win (barring a very viable third-party candidacy that would peel votes from the Democrats).

And no, Stephen Harper did not ‘wipe out’ protection for waterways (he updated old, inefficient regulations) nor did he do anything to libraries other than consolidate them and have their information made available online. Informed people already know all this, of course…

Chretien promised during the 1993 election campaign to renegotiate NAFTA or, if that was not possible, tear it up.
In the end he did neither. So, saying he refused to undo NAFTA is misleading.

Indeed, if we go that route, we can say he refused to undo the GST – despite the fact abolishing it was a major campaign promise. Sheila Copps can provide more detail ????

FWIW, I supported (and still support) NAFTA and the GST/HST. But the blatant breaking of campaign promises is a major contributor to the less than stellar way in which politics and politicians are viewed by us ordinary folks – looking at you, Mr Trudeau (FPTP, transparency, omnibus budget bills, etc).

Sadly, I don’t expect a Prime Minister Scheer would mitigate my cynicism.

I think this country needs a decade or so with numerous independent MPs, of all political stripes. The party system has devolved into a ridiculous circus of trained lapdogs, who just repeat the party’s talking points and add zero value of their own. We need a system where MPs can express their own opinions and advocate for causes they care about.

Given the way the Canadian parliamentary system is structure, perhaps an “Independent Party” should be created? It would enjoy all of the enshrined perks of an official party, but it wouldn’t actually have any specific platform. Each candidate would have their own platform. Thoughts?

Campbell was never *elected* as PM (like PM BoJo in Britain). However, her real “sin” is, as PM, taking a 153 seat majority PC government down to a derisive 2 seats in the 1993 election. And, FWIW, neither of those seats were hers.

I think it fair to say that the PCs were not expected to win the 1993 election. But 2 seats? That takes a certain skill.

Party affiliation is very low in Vancouver-Granville and in Vancouver generally. Partly owing to the fact that so many people in Vancouver were not born there, partly owing to the fact that the Reform Party experiment in the 90s blew up a lot of old allegiances and created some odd new ones (e.g., old Tories migrating to the provincial BC Liberal Party to break bread with Martinite federal Liberals).

Plus JWR was a notably popular MP in her riding even before SNC hit the fan. I’ve seen her around on city streets just having a coffee or whatever and she gets a lot love. The Tory vote probably won’t be a serious factor. The last Tory to get elected in the City of Vancouver was Kim Campbell in 1988. That’s 31 years ago if you’re counting. One of the things that really bugs me about today’s CPC is the fact that they don’t seem to give a shit that casting a vote for them in Vancouver is an utter waste of time.

Yup…and let’s not forget the old Social Credit Party. As you no doubt already know, one of the reasons the Conservatives have never done well here is because the BC Liberal Party was founded by the remnants of the Socreds. Least liberal Liberals in the country, I think…which is why I didn’t mind voting for them a couple of times.

237,Warren Kinsella,The sounds of (political) silence,2019-09-10 07:10:00,Warren,,"Above: example of when a politician should’ve shut up.

The sounds of silence.

It’s not just the name of an old Simon and Garfunkel song. It’s a way to achieve political success, too.

Two anecdotes, from two sides of the political divide.

Several eons ago, this writer was a speechwriter for Jean Chrétien. It was kind of like being the Maytag Repairman, to be honest. Jean Chrétien doesn’t ever need any help in crafting a political tub-thumper. He’s pretty good at that all on his own.

One day, however, our opponents were saying all kinds of nasty things about the then-Liberal leader. The subject matter doesn’t matter. What mattered was Chrétien’s abject refusal to say anything back. Why, Boss, I asked him.

“We don’t have to be in the damn paper every day, young man,” he said. “People don’t like it. They want to hear from us when it’s important. But not all the time. Silence is good.”

Another anecdote, from the other side of the aisle.

Not as long ago, my good friend John Walsh was the president of the Conservative Party. As such, he’d periodically meet with the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper.

Two times, he did, and Harper held up a newspaper and pointed at a column by – this is the best part of the anecdote, in my opinion – Yours Truly. Both columns talked about how the then-presidents of the Liberal Party of Canada, who shall remain nameless, were in the media way, way too much.

“See what Kinsella said?” Harper asked John Walsh. “He said nobody can name the president of the Conservative Party, and that’s how we know how good at your job you are.”

Harper agreed. Too much media? Bad. Silence? Good.

Brian Mulroney? In the paper all the time, with Meech Lake, Charlottetown Accord, big meetings with big wheels, blah blah blah. His party got reduced to two seats.

Justin Trudeau? This week, the irrepressible David Akin added up all of the stuff Trudeau and his minions have been announcing. The result was shocking, if not sickening: “In August alone, Liberal MPs made 4,545 new spending commitments worth $12.8 billion.”

And, after all of those announcements and all of the resulting news coverage, has Justin Trudeau abruptly gotten a lot more popular? Nope.

In fact, some pollsters are telling this writer that all that ink hasn’t helped Trudeau much at all. Indeed, they say, there’s evidence to suggest the precise opposite is happening.

Another example.

Just over a year ago, the Ontario PCs roared back into power, and commenced holding special sittings of the legislature, energetically passing umpteen laws and getting in the media a lot. A lot, a lot.

Did it boost their popularity? Um, no. Their popularity went South, fast.

So, Premier Doug Ford hired a brilliant ex-newsman to be his Chief of Staff, and reminded his ministers of that old adage – speak when you have something to say, folks. Not when you have to say something.

Doug Ford thereafter stepped into the political equivalent of the witness protection program, and invited his ministers to join him. Result? Morale is way up, controversies are way down.

Just watch: Ford’s numbers are going to start inching up as a result, too. And so will Andrew Scheer’s – because Andrew Scheer benefits when Doug Ford isn’t in the news all the time. (Justin Trudeau, not so much.)

The moral of this cautionary tale is this: in all of those 4,545 new spending commitments Justin Trudeau made in a single month – out of all of that extraordinary $12.8 billion in spending – can you remember a single damn thing that was announced?

The sounds of silence, folks: it’s more than a nice song.

Just my take but it should made illegal to introduce new spending withing 4 months of an election. If it was not important enough to announce in the first 3 + years then it is not important enough to announce in the last 4 months. This would reduce the tax payer funded travel to “announce stuff”.

A brilliant insight. Chretien knew it and so did Harper. Unfortunately, down south, no one seems to know it.

I don’t know how many times in the past few years I’ve tried to imagine myself as an independent or middle American voter and concluded that Trump is an embarrassing disaster, only to pause in disgust at the nonsense spewed out by Dems rushing to the microphone and a media trying to boost profits by slamming the grammar of his tweets and the silliness of his kids. Not good for anybody.

“All I see is Scheer’s grinning face all day long. Rarely see Trudeau.”

Mostly because the Conservatives have so much more money to spend right now.

235,Warren Kinsella,How Justin Trudeau could lose,2019-09-10 20:48:00,Warren,,"In it for you.

It’s the New Democrats – now a sad shadow of their former selves – who, ironically, came up with the best slogan for the 2019 federal election campaign: in it for you.

That’s what just about every election campaign is about, this one included. Which party best understands the lives of everyday Canadians. Which leader actually has the best understanding of the struggles your family faces every single day.

Justin Trudeau is at a big disadvantage, here. That’s because Justin wasn’t simply born with silver spoon in his mouth.

It was more like a silver shovel.

Trudeau is the guy who likes to talk about the middle class, a lot. But he has never, ever actually experienced the middle class. Trudeau has never had to worry about paying the rent, or coming up with the next mortgage statement.

He has never wondered where he’ll get the dough to pay a hydro bill. He has never wanted for anything. His life has been one of mansions, private jets, and hanging out with celebrities like the Aga Khan.

Against Andrew Scheer – who grew up in a big immigrant Catholic family, and whose family didn’t have the wealth Trudeau did – the Liberal leader will likely appear privileged and out-of-touch. Scheer worked as a waiter and a salesman.

Trudeau, meanwhile, wears a $15,000 IWC Portuguese Regulateur watch and drives a Mercedes-Benz 300SL he got from his Dad. (Which, apparently, can sell for millions.)

Who is in it for me – who best understands my life?

If the 2019 election ballot question becomes that question, Justin Trudeau is deep, deep trouble. Smart Liberals know this. That’s why Trudeau rolls up his sleeves, and loosens his tie, and rarely wears a suit when on the campaign hustings. That’s why he talks about the middle class all the time.

But not all Liberals are smart.

Last week, some less-than-smart Grits revealed a big poster of Finance Minister Bill Morneau wearing an expensive, tailor-made bespoke suit, tugging at what looked like French cuffs and pricey cufflinks. It didn’t exactly scream “middle class.”

By this week, Liberals had pasted over that unhelpful image with campaign posters.

But the deeply-dumb Liberals weren’t done yet. Shortly afterwards, some of them actually cooked up a hashtag to mock Andrew Scheer’s comparatively-humble beginnings. One of them, a Liberal MP – the heretofore unknown Gagan Sikand, soon to be the former MP for Mississauga-Streetsville – actually tweeted this: “Scheer Was So Poor he had to buy his Conservative Values second-hand from Stephen Harper.”

Sikand, a lawyer, actually wrote that. He actually tweeted that. It was the 2019 campaign’s Beer-and-Popcorn moment: people with more, making fun of people who have less.

Lots of other Liberals went online, too, giddily promoting the “Scheer Was So Poor” hashtag.

It recalled late 2005, when this writer was huddled on a cold bench at a hockey rink somewhere, waiting out a son’s early-morning practice. A revelation hit me: the Liberals were Starbucks, and the Conservatives were Tim Horton’s. The Tories were going to win with a campaign that was aimed at the Tim’s crowd, not the latte-sipping elites who frequent Starbucks. And win they did.

No one should ever underestimate Justin Trudeau’s retail political skills. No one should ever discount his party’s organizational chops.

But if this race truly becomes who is really “in it for you?”

I can understand why the rich vote Liberal. I can understand why the poor vote Liberal.

I cannot for the life of me see the appeal of this government for the middle class. My sister and brother-in-law are considered “somewhat upper” middle class. They had a baby a few years ago and due to changes to the child benefit rules, they get….zilch. I thought the benefit was supposed to be universal? When did it become a baby bonus exclusively for the poor who do not want to better themselves and now have even less incentive to do so, and who already pay zero in tax??

The Trudeau Liberals have done more to concentrate wealth in the hands of the rich AND the poor than any other government in Canada’s history. Between excessively high immigration pushing down wages and pushing up housing, abusively high taxation to those with professional accomplishments, and a bump in public sector employment further entrenching the divide between a privileged, overpaid, and underworked civil service vs. an underpaid and overworked private sector, this government has been a disaster for the shrinking middle.

Well, Scheer quickly dumped his “humble”origins at age 25, and rapidly adapted to a well-paid lifestyle funded exclusively from the public purse, from whence he has somehow made himself into a wealthy man. Not paying rent for over a decade no doubt helped immensely. Trudeau also “worked” at being a teacher or something.

I have no time for either man – they’re both as out of touch with actual wage slaves as are their parties which kowtow to big business interests over the people who elected their respective MPs – but this column to my mind is a kind of carefully wrought rendering that purposely omits relevant facts so as to present a skewed viewpoint. Disingenuous. And Scheer is a Con, thus rendering him 100% entirely useless in my personal opinion as lacking any kind of imagination whatsoever, beyond the usual hackneyed Tory nonsense, repeated endlessly for the bewildered gullible since Maggie Thatcher thundered BS in Britain. That eventually got you lot in Ontario a premier well-known for his intellectual vision, yet one who seems to know how to butter both sides of his personal slice of wholewheat bread, while disclaiming any presence of dairy product whatsoever.

Both Trudeau and Scheer are privileged far beyond your average Canuck, and picking out one as some blue collar “I’m for you, working man!” wunderboy, while excoriating the other as a dilettante is fatuous nonsense. A distinction without a difference related to their current circumstances.

Why not list their current worths if you want to make a relevant comment?

From the internet, Scheer’s current worth is $3 million, so he’s not begging for quarters on the streets. Trudeau at $12 million is ahead. I wish I had a few hundred thou myself.

How about concentrating on some election issues yourself beyond the two major leaders and their circumstances? I know, no fun at all, is it? Kind of hard work. But that’s the meat and taters for the rest of us, which opinion-makers carefully avoid wading into, it seems to me.

The narrative has sure shifted since last election. Trudeau was ridiculed by PCs for his lowly work as a teacher. A lightweight compared to Harper’s pre-politics analyst for a right wing think tank.

And now Scheer is lauded for a couple years work as a waiter and in an insurance office. A working man , middle class, forget the need for a PM with a significant pre-politics resume.

234,Warren Kinsella,LavScam shocker: Trudeau PMO blocking Mounties’ obstruction of justice investigation,2019-09-10 21:54:00,Warren,,"I’d say the election just found its defining moment, wouldn’t you?

These guys make Donald Trump look like a rank amateur.


The RCMP has been looking into potential obstruction of justice in the handling of the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., but its examination has been stymied by the federal government’s refusal to lift cabinet confidentiality for all witnesses, The Globe and Mail has learned.


This means individuals involved in the matter cannot discuss events or share documents with police that have not been exempted from the rule of cabinet confidentiality, according to sources, who The Globe agreed not to identify so they could discuss the RCMP inquiries.


In Canada, the principle of cabinet confidentiality is intended to allow ministers to debate decisions freely in private. As a result, discussions involving cabinet matters must be kept secret unless a waiver is granted. In the SNC matter, the Liberals say that the Clerk of the Privy Council, who heads the bureaucratic agency that serves the Prime Minister’s Office, made the decision not to offer a broad waiver to either the RCMP or to the Ethics Commissioner, and that the PMO played no role.


A source who was recently interviewed by the RCMP told The Globe that investigators indicated they are looking into possible obstruction of justice. The Criminal Code says obstruction of justice occurs when an effort is made to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice in a judicial proceeding.”


The national police force will pause the operation because of the coming election campaign. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is scheduled to go to Rideau Hall Wednesday to ask the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament and call the vote for Oct. 21, and the RCMP has a policy to suspend politically sensitive operations during campaigns.


Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod said the decision not to offer a broader waiver for the RCMP “was made solely by the Clerk of the Privy Council as guardian of cabinet confidences.” Mr. Trudeau’s director of communications, Cameron Ahmad, said the PMO was not involved in the decision.


Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion faced the same obstacle as the RCMP in his investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair earlier this year, stating in his final reportthat nine witnesses were unable to provide full testimony because government allowed only a limited waiver on cabinet secrecy.


Mr. Dion found that Mr. Trudeau breached the Conflict of Interest Act. His report said the Prime Minister and senior federal officials improperly pressed Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister and attorney-general to order the director of public prosecutions to settle bribery and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin without a trial.

What’s the difference between Trudeau being accused of obstruction of justice and the accusation of obstruction of justice made against Trump?
Let’s see… The Mueller investigation went on for more than 2 years and Mueller issued more than 2,800 subpoenas. Mueller also issued about 500 search warrants. Millions of documents were handed over to Mueller and Mueller admitted under oath that Trump didn’t interfere with his investigation. Despite unfettered access to witnesses and documents, Mueller found he couldn’t charge Trump with anything.
Meanwhile, the Ethics Commissioner of Canada said outright that the PMO interfered with his investigation, that information was kept confidential which preventing witnesses from speaking freely. The RCMP also said that the PMO interfered with its investigation. The RCMP told the Globe and Mail it would have to drop the investigation into the Trudeau obstruction of justice case after the election was called.
Trudeau interfered with the #LavScam investigation at every level. Jody Wilson Raybould said when she addressed Parliament that she was unable to speak freely. Unlike Trump, Trudeau totally interfered with witness testimony.
Hate Trump all you like, but he cooperated fully with Mueller’s investigation. Trudeau can’t say that he cooperated with Parliament, the Ethics Commissioner, and the RCMP at all.

It was clear that Mueller couldn’t charge Trump with anything because of the Justice Department policy not to charge a sitting president.

Damn…you just can’t stop yourself, can you Darwin? Trump Derangement Syndrome has an unbreakable grip on you, and you don’t even know it.

“It was clear that Mueller couldn’t charge Trump with anything because of the Justice Department policy not to charge a sitting president.”

Oh, please. Mueller couldn’t charge Trump with anything because he found NOTHING to charge him with. He did his very best to charge everyone remotely connected to Trump’s campaign with minor process crimes in a futile attempt to justify his ‘investigation’, but failed utterly in connecting Donald Trump to any “Russian collusion”.

(although, strangely, he somehow failed to pursue any of the *real* Russian collusion he found involving the Clinton campaign….along with the illegal campaign finance misdirection that paid for the fake “dossier”. Hmmm…)

“Trump didn’t fully cooperate. ”

And WHY SHOULD HE?? With Meuller stacking his investigative staff with as many partisan Democrats as he could find, veering off on every possible tangent that steered well clear of any Democratic wrongdoing but managed to dredge up petty bullshit like Stormy Daniels and her sleazebag lawyer, why in the hell would he grant Robert Mueller ANYTHING?

“He didn’t do the requested face-to-face interview. ”

GOOD. I wouldn’t have either. He knew Mueller was so desperate to save face that he would have dredged up any potentially embarrassing incidents he could find, no matter how *completely unrelated* to the original ‘investigation’ they were. Good move by Trump to leave that smarmy prick twiting in the wind.

“Mueller listed several cases where Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation.”

More misdirection. Donald Trump could actually have *shut down* the so-called ‘investigation’ any time he wanted, but didn’t.

Like I’ve said a number of times before, you and your kind appear to have learned *nothing* from your repeated failures to smear Trump; the more you try, the more people you drive into his camp. Now you’re just embarrassing yourself…and of course HELPING HIM GET RE-ELECTED in the process.

As much as I don’t care for the man and would love to see him defeated, the American public now finds the Democrats and their useful idiots to be even more abhorrent than Trump (check his numbers: they are going *up* for a reason, despite the fact that you people are so utterly unable to understand why). I can’t wait to laugh at you all when he gets a second term THANKS TO YOU. It will almost be worth it.

Fred,

I don’t know about you but I’m squarely in the Scaramucci camp. Trump is clearly already incapacitated and he’s doesn’t have the luxury of having been re-elected like Reagan was when he became dysfunctional. IMHO, there’s no way in hell that he’s up to the rigours of the 2020 campaign, so I expect he’ll eventually give way to Pence, who supposedly is now more popular than Trump.





doconnor says: 

September 12, 2019 at 5:00 pm

If the Department of Justice policy on charging the president had nothing to do with not charging him, why does Mueller have a large section of his report going over the policy?

You are aware that the dossier originated with Republican opponents of Trump? While the dossier contains information from Russian intelligence, there is no reason to believe they cooperated with it or offered it up willing.

Fully cooperating would have made him seem less guilty in the eyes of the public and Congress.





Fred from BC says:

” IMHO, there’s no way in hell that he’s up to the rigours of the 2020 campaign, so I expect he’ll eventually give way to Pence, who supposedly is now more popular than Trump.”

I wouldn’t bet against you on that, Ronald. As much as I despise a guy like Micheal Moore, I have to admit that was right about Trump’s election being “the biggest political FUCK YOU! in American history”, and that he *may* have been right about Trump never expecting to win the election in the first place . Being US President is a tough and thankless job; why would a 70-year-old billionaire need that when he could be out screwing porn stars (not to mention whatever the hell else one can do with that kind of money and unlimited free time)?

I hope he allows Pence to take over. The man is a bit too religious for my tastes, but at least he’s soft-spoken, polite and doesn’t live for Twitter ‘likes’…

And what exactly would the Cons do differently if caught in the same circumstances? Eh? They stopped regular scientists, quite a few of whom I know personally, from expressing their true results under harper’s paranoia land of dystopia, even sending along “minders” to accompany them to conferences to make sure they toed the predetermined line. The public paid the scientists’ salaries, but the Cons stifled their output to suit their agenda. Wholesale demagoguery.

Then harper put the screws to Duffy by getting the RCMP to lay 31 charges against the man, a disreputable person to be sure to my mind – but EVERY ONE of those charges was dismissed by the judge, who said that the guilty ones didn’t appear before him, and issued a tongue-lashing. Water off a duck’s back.

My, how the memory becomes selective when you’re on a roll! Both the Libs and Cons are in it for themselves and their sponsors. Avoid both and don’t touch them with a ten-foot pole is my advice. Gerrymandering opportunists sums both of them up – organizations of little or no honour.

And why does cabinet confidentiality have a veto over a criminal investigation? I thought no one is suppose to be above the law?

If Scheer was smart, an election promise to outlaw the ability to legally obstruct an investigation by the RCMP should be apart of a Sunny Ways commitment to the electorate.

Lib minority with NDP and/or Green support, another election in two years. Cons and Greens will gain seats, Libs and NDP lose some. Quebec is unpredictable, and might do a classic decisive shift (Green? Bloc?). I think Greens will find a seat or two in the Maritimes somewhere. My prediction.

When you say that everyone made up their minds about SNC-Lavalin already, you’re assuming that everyone was paying attention at the time. I don’t think that’s a valid assumption. Many of us here may keep track of what’s going on, but there seems to be a very significant number of voters who completely ignore just about everything that happens between elections, and only start paying attention a few weeks after the writ has dropped. If then.

So I wouldn’t be too sure that SNC-Lavalin is over – especially not with recent headlines, and Trudeau’s refusal to answer direct questions at the election launch.

Could be, could be! Definitely true about most people not paying much attention. Just for me personally, it’s a dead issue as I’ve already decided I don’t like what happened, and any further news is just noise. I was supposing, from the polls (ack, foolishness of course), that the damage had already sunk in and enough people grew to tolerate the whole affair to make the Liberals competitive again.

I really hope that the kind of corruption and obstruction we’ve seen so far don’t become as ‘tolerable’ to Canadians as they seem to be down south.

Sadly, I don’t think most voters will consider this important. The CBC will focus, not on the issue of obstruction of justice, but on whether or not this issue will affect liberal chances of being elected. However, if the election race remains close, this issue may result in 3 to 5 percent of Ontario liberal voters switching or staying home, provided the opposition parties can provide a credible case for supporting them. My observations of personal liberal voting friends would indeed suggest they hold an unquestioning belief in the integrity of the party and will rationalize away with great skill any issue such as this. However, I also frankly surprised to hear these friends note, at a recent meal, they don’t find Andrew Scheer “scary”.

So, in conclusion, “who knows”. However, with the CBC seeming to be the “house media outlet” for the liberal party the edge still has to remain there – a “third world situation” for sure.

As a lawyer who is no fan of JT, I’m hoping this does not result in charges, mainly because I’m very dubious they would succeed. Unless there is a clear, unambiguous smoking gun of the “Back off SNC-Lavalin or lose your job” variety, this is probably too politically nebulous to ground a criminal conviction. No criminal court would find obstruction of justice on complicated circumstantial evidence, but it’s already enough for a lot of voters.

Agreed. They’ve smartly cloaked it in PCO clothes. But the law is one thing and the court of the public opinion quite another. This will get traction nonetheless.

Warren, I agree with you, and the others on this thread.

The problem is whether or not the other media giants, other than the G&M, report on this outrage and carry the story further. The G&M story mentions that the RCMP investigation is currently on hold until after the election.

Since this is the case, I hope the opposition leaders and the media delve into the G&M article. Otherwise, the article is not the “defining moment”.

Ronald O'Dowd says:

Like I said above, they were smart to cloak this using PCO. But where they were incredibly stupid was in not making 100% sure that no one could possibly PROVE that they instructed PCO to proceed as they did. They aren’t politically sophisticated enough to have done that, so expect a bombshell in the campaign when proof ultimately leaks 0ut that they put PCO up to it. And then they’ll be finished politically.

What I’m a bit surprised at is how Sheer hasn’t really capitalized on this. Why has he not come out and said that if the Conservatives form government he will waive privilege and cabinet confidentiality, allowing the RCMP to investigate and JWR to fully, and restart the committee investigation?
But it is still early so maybe he’s holding that particular card until the time is right.

Or it could be that a previous track record exists of CPC MPs eagerly doing the bidding of corps while in government. Doesn’t mean that was done by the Conservatives for the Irvings, SNC, Davie, etc. But we all know what bad political ops can do.

A future government cannot waive the cabinet confidence of a previous government.

Harper totally and ocmpletey waived any cabinet confidences of his government relatin to the Norman affair in writing, and the Trudeau government still tried to prevent the release of documents, even falsely claiming at one point that Harper had not waived privilege completely.

Trudeau can waive cabinet confidentiality relating to SNC. It is totally his choice. He is lying when he says that it is NOT. He is obstructing justice.

The RCMP should go to court. It would be an interesting (unwritten) constitutional case.

The other problem they have is Harper in 2011: a guy somewhat less likable than Scheer, who Canadian voters put confidence in for one term, hence the majority. Harper’s majority was really hard-fought and an uphill climb. IMHO, Scheer’s will be less so.

The Liberals will win a majority. All of the leaders are weaker than weak, but Singh is not even close to being up to the job. That will send many traditional NDP votes to the Liberals. Trudeau stands out from the remaining crowd due to his celebrity. Canadians seem to have an inferiority complex about being noticed. Trudeau may be phony and the people behind the curtain may be incompetent, but at least he will attract global media coverage.

Pretty clear now why they called the election on a day like September 11. The RCMP has a policy to suspend politically sensitive operations during a campaign, so, what do you do? Begin a campaign! Un-effing-believable. I see that the Globe is reporting that the RCMP has had a chat with JWR. I’m not a lawyer, but could she in this case say things that she’s not allowed to say publically? I’m guessing no if the RCMP can’t get anything from cabinet. Can anyone spare some help in me understanding this?

Des,

Take this with a large grain of salt as I’m no expert but it’s my impression that CC and SCP are absolutely binding without an all encompassing release. In short, she can’t say zip to the cops, about matters outside the purview of the limited waiver, without with an express and complete waiver from Trudeau’s PMO. And even God can’t get Trudeau to do that.

Former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould met with RCMP investigators this week to discuss political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., and is calling on the Trudeau government to waive cabinet confidentiality for her and all other witnesses to allow a thorough probe into potential obstruction of justice.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould told The Globe and Mail on Wednesday that RCMP officers from the national division in Ottawa, which handles sensitive political matters, had a formal interview with her in Vancouver on Tuesday.

“I have had a meeting and I have been interviewed by the RCMP, and that meeting happened yesterday [Tuesday], and I am not going to comment any further on the nature of those conversations,” she said. “Of course I am concerned about the government’s decision to deny [the RCMP’s] request for access to other witnesses. As a matter of principle, the RCMP should be able to conduct thorough and necessary investigations.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the meeting was at the request of the RCMP after several telephone conversations with her following the release of a report from Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion in August.

Mr. Dion said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated the Conflict of Interest Act when he and senior officials improperly pressed Ms. Wilson-Raybould to order the Public Prosecution Service to settle a fraud and bribery case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction giant…

The government says Privy Council Clerk Ian Shugart, who reports to Mr. Trudeau, will not waive cabinet confidentiality to allow the national police force to speak to witnesses and obtain cabinet documents relating to SNC-Lavalin.

<p><em><strong>“I have had a meeting and I have been interviewed by the RCMP, and that meeting happened yesterday [Tuesday], and I am not going to comment any further on the nature of those conversations,” she said. “Of course I am concerned about the government’s decision to deny [the RCMP’s] request for access to other witnesses. As a matter of principle, the RCMP should be able to conduct thorough and necessary investigations.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the meeting was at the request of the RCMP after several telephone conversations with her following the release of a report from Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion in August.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mr. Dion said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated the Conflict of Interest Act when he and senior officials improperly pressed Ms. Wilson-Raybould to order the Public Prosecution Service to settle a fraud and bribery case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction giant…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The government says Privy Council Clerk Ian Shugart, who reports to Mr. Trudeau, will not waive cabinet confidentiality to allow the national police force to speak to witnesses and obtain cabinet documents relating to SNC-Lavalin.</strong></em></p>

People have yet to grasp how historic this is. Trudeau’s only PM found guilty of ethic violations & then blocks investigation of the issues surrounding that finding.
Does that bring to mind another famous leader, with huge upside but forced to resign?
This will be a Justin Trudeau & Liberal Party legacy that Academics will lecture on for years, like they do Nixon & Watergate.

I expect vociferous disagreement, but the RCMP really shouldn’t be interviewing witnesses during a general election campaign (yes, technically a day before the writ dropped, but everyone knew it was coming) when they could be reasonably sure that the fact of their interview with a central figure in the affair–if not the substance–would become public knowledge.

Here in the lower 48, we had a little bit of experience with a national investigative body making a high-profile intervention during a general election campaign, back in 2016. Didn’t go well. The FBI was wrong to do so then, and the RCMP was wrong to do so now, absent a compelling reason to act during the campaign. In this case, JWR wasn’t going anywhere, and certainly would have met with the RCMP after the election.

That’s not PCO’s role. They are there to run the top echelon of the public service and to offer dispassionate and arms-length advice and assistance to PMO. They are not there to get a PM out of political jams or to informally become adjunct to Team PMO. Period.

PCO’s clerk Wernick, now Shugart and before them Lynch are part the reasons that the public has lost faith and believe civil servants, agency bureaucrats, even ex SCC judges are lap dogs for the LPC and like most politicians can’t be believed. By their games with the SNC Lavalin file, they encouraged more distrust in our institutions.

Don’t think Trudeau is hurt THIS time. But IMHO, it’s a mistake to repeatedly ghost oneself. After a while it sinks in: what is he afraid of and more importantly, what does he absolutely not want to talk about repeatedly in this campaign? Here’s a hint: three letters. If it becomes all about SNC pretty much all of the time then Trudeau is royally screwed.

“Didn’t watch. Know anyone who did?”

Nope. And from at least two of the six recaps I’ve read, I was wise to stick to my “no watching of debates if Elizabeth May is included” policy of the last two decades or so. She did exactly what she always does: TALKED OVER everyone else, making actual debate impossible. In her world, the person with the loudest voice is the winner; in mine, that’s just rude and annoying.

(insert Donald Trump comparison here…;)

But to be honest, I don’t even care to hear what the NDP says either. I would much prefer the American style debate where only the two people who could possibly form government are heard from…up here, it’s just grandstanding, virtue signalling, clever quips or stunts to try and get that all-important sound byte on the evening news (well done, Elizabeth!) and a colossal waste of our time.

Tactically, it makes not one bit of sense for Prime Minister Trudeau to volunteer information or provide access to information outside of formal access to information channels or requests for information that contain cabinet agreement for confidentiality.

My take on the right-of-center punditry is that most are simply belly aching over the fact that PM Trudeau will not voluntarily fall on his sword for the Conservative Party so that they can win the election outright.

Trudeau’s political advisors are not that naïve.

I dont understand how there is any tactical advantage for a prime minister who ran on transparency and openness to blatantly and arrogantly lie to his constituents. Especially in Canada, where truthfulness still has a modicum of value.

Of course, Trudeau won’t broaden the CC confidentiality waiver because even he knows that if it all comes spilling out, he’s definitely going to be out of a job. That’s the only reason why they’ve held the line.

226,Warren Kinsella,My latest: Trudeau’s Seinfeldian campaign launch,2019-09-13 14:33:00,Warren,,"Nothing.

That’s what Justin Trudeau had to say when he launched this, the 43rd federal general election. Zero, zippo, zilch.

Oh, sure, he said some stuff. He stood there in front of Rideau Hall, a focus-grouped gaggle of ethnically-diverse Canadians behind him, and he sprayed the usual Trudeau-esque word salad all over the unimpressed ink-stained wretches.

“I’m for moving forward for everyone,” he squeaked, oozing boyish charm. “We’ve all got a choice to make: keep moving forward and build on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years.”

Odd, that. Firstly, last time we checked, Stephen Harper isn’t running in this election. And, secondly, if the Liberals’ oxymoronic brain trust think Stephen Harper’s name still evokes fear and loathing from coast to coast to coast, they’re on drugs.

Smart Conservatives say that Harper ain’t reviled like he was four years ago. Not even close. Keep talking about Harper, Grits.

But that isn’t what was so bizarre about Justin Trudeau’s campaign launch. What was bizarre was this: nothing.

Meaning, that’s what he said: nothing. Apart from the jab at a guy who isn’t running, Justin Trudeau didn’t put the minutest amount of effort into defining the so-called ballot question. He didn’t say why he wants to keep being Prime Minister.

Years ago, Ted Kennedy blew his shot at the presidency when he couldn’t answer that eminently-reasonable question, posed to him by CBS’ Roger Mudd. Conversely, on Wednesday, all the other major party leaders said why they wanted the top job.

Invoking her inner Trekkie, the Greens’ Elizabeth May called us Earthlings, and said it’s all about climate change. The NDP’s Jagmeet Singh said the vote is about the little guy and gal, and he’s all for the little people.

Andrew Scheer cheerfully reminded everyone to read up on how Trudeau is stonewalling a police probe of LavScam – and then said the election is about pocketbook stuff, and helping folks get ahead. Which he’ll do.

It’s Politics 101, more basic than never getting photographed while eating something: on Day One, you get your guy or gal to bound up to a microphone and say what the election is all about, and why you are the best guy or gal for the job. And then you charge off to your campaign plane or bus, and head out to the hinterland.

(Unless you’re May and Singh, that is, in which case you will be campaigning on bicycles, or using a brisk walk.)

Justin Trudeau didn’t do that. He did what Teddy Kennedy did: he said nothing, basically.

In fairness to the Liberal leader, there’s not much he can say. After mishandling relations with India, China and the US – to wit, where’s the new NAFTA, Justy? – foreign affairs ain’t anything to brag about. Likewise, domestic affairs: Trudeau has helped to elect seven, count ‘em, seven conservative Premiers across Canada.

Same with ethics: he’s the first Prime Minister in history to be found guilty of violating two federal statutes (over LavScam and the Aga Khan) while still in office.

Fiscal probity? It is to laugh: he giddily broke his solemn promise to balance the budget. Ditto electoral reform. Feminism? Um: Gropegate, elbowed a female MP in the chest, exiled two women who (a) are way smarter than him and who (b) wouldn’t do what he told them to.

And so on, and so on. Justin Trudeau has nothing to say, and nothing he said. So he stepped out into the Ottawa sunshine, that cloying grin playing on the face that isn’t as youthful as it used to be, and said what he’s done to improve Canada, and what he’ll do to improve it if re-elected.

It reminds me of the very good column Andrew Coyne wrote the other day, pointing out that despite the fact that their respective partisan camps would scream the contrary, there really isn’t a lot that substantively differentiates the Liberals and Conservatives (e.g., they both support free trade, NATO, public health care, won’t criminalize abortion, won’t ban same sex marriage, etc.).

That IMO is why the Liberals are dredging up old clips of Scheer expressing his disapproval of abortion and SSM — the Liberals want to pour gasoline on culture war stuff to create essentially the illusion of differentiation (where not a ton of differentiation actually exists).

About the only significant exception of substance is on the climate change file. And even there it’s a difference in policy and legislative approach. Scheer’s not doing a Trump and refusing to say that anthropogenic climate change doesn’t exist.

I’m wondering seriously where his handlers are coming from or if he listens to them at all. The other day I heard him defend skipping the debates by saying that he was really excited about debating the other leaders, but he was even more excited to be on the West coast. He’s often so excited about attending Pride Days he sounds like he’d prorogue parliament to get to one. It’s just all so exciting and fun for him. It’s so different from his father, who never pretended he enjoyed campaigning, had to be strong-armed into meeting hoi polloi and got away with a cynical, tongue-in-cheek quip about “my beloved Alberta”. Doesn’t anybody on his team think a little somber gravitas would help him? He adores his father, but he’s definitely his mother’s son.

The Harper Derangement Syndrome is becoming nauseating at this point.

First of all, Harper was never “reviled” except by the far left who never votes Conservative anyway. The Tories got about the same number of votes in 2015 as they did in 2011. Virtually all the voters who gave him his majority seemed pretty content, by and large. Trudeau’s successful strategy was, of course, bringing in brand new young voters on promises of pot and electoral reform. One was accomplished, the other crashed and burned. Will those young people, and the new i-Gen kids who have turned 18+ since 2015, show up this year in such big numbers? The answer will determine who wins.

The Liberals are constantly evoking Harper’s name as if the 2015 election was won by a 20-point landslide and Harper was forced to flee to Ecuador in disgrace!

I think this is a hyperbolic piece. He hasn’t done nothing. Lifting many families out of poverty via changes to the child benefit etc. was significant, medically assisted dying was significant, cannabis legalization is significant, carbon tax is significant… Now, I agree about JWR and JP, who were instrumental in many of the real achievements, ironically. And I have no real time for the Trudeau Liberals, not voting for them. But man, it seems pugilistically hyperbolic to just add it all up to nothing.

Pedant says:

Changes to the child benefit meaning that hardworking people in the middle class now get nothing (or next to nothing) while the poor, who pay ZERO tax to begin with, receive a treasure chest of taxpayer cash?

Trudeau has successfully concentrated wealth in the hands of the rich AND the poor while screwing the middle class. Gutting the TFSA is another example.

Where are Canada’s economic advances? China is not buying our canola or pork, we have a big debt, the Canadian dollar is weak, and a lot of employment is part-time. The American economy is the reason for the improvement in ours.

Why did the PM call the election on September 11? That’s so insensitive. Let me guess. He wanted to start the campaign before we learned about obstruction of the RCMP investigation into possible obstruction of justice charges.

The precise date was chosen badly – at best it was insensitive, and at worst it can be seen as a direct insult to our American allies.

220,Warren Kinsella,My latest: Trudeau has the power to let her speak,2019-09-16 07:56:00,Warren,,"Let her speak.

That was the headline on an iconic Toronto Sun headline way back in February: let her speak.

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould – then still a cabinet minister, then still a member of the Liberal caucus – tell Canadians what she knew about Justin Trudeau’s attempts to influence the prosecution of the corruption trial of Quebec’s SNC-Lavalin, a big donor to his party.

It was important. In early February, the Globe and Mail had revealed that Trudeau and ten of his most-senior advisors had attempted to short-circuit SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution no less than 22 times over a four-month period. Wilson-Raybould said no, 22 times.

It would be wrong, she said. It was obstruction of justice, others would say.

Enraged by this proud Indigenous woman who didn’t know her place, Justin Trudeau demoted Jody Wilson-Raybould to Veteran’s Affairs. But the LavScam story wouldn’t go away. The scandal grew. There was a cancer on the Office of the Prime Minister, and everyone knew it.

Desperate, Trudeau relented somewhat. He issued a cabinet decision permitting Wilson-Raybould to speak about some – but not all – of what she knew. She testified before a Commons committee, and what she had to say plunged the Trudeau regime into one of the biggest scandals in recent Canadian political history.

When she testified, however, Jody Wilson-Raybould made one thing clear: she had more to say. She knew things Canadians needed to know.

But still, Trudeau would not let her tell all. And, even now, with the election campaign underway, Justin Trudeau refuses to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak.

How long the RCMP have been investigating LavScam is unknown. Trudeau and his senior staff lawyered up months ago, so perhaps it’s been that long. But the Mounties are on the case – and Justin Trudeau is doing his utmost to stymie their investigation. He’s adamantly refused to waive the cabinet confidentiality that would let Wilson-Raybould speak to the police.

Reached by the Sun on Friday, Wilson-Raybould said that she has spoken to the police, and more than once. But she says there’s not much she can say to them, or me.

Said Wilson-Raybould to the Sun: “Thanks for your inquiry. I can confirm that I was interviewed by the RCMP on Tuesday of this week. I am not going to comment any further on the nature of those discussions.”

Not because she doesn’t want to, of course. But because Justin Trudeau – the guy who solemnly promised in 2015 to return ethics to Canadian public life – won’t let her. He says the Clerk of the Privy Council – his personal bureaucrat – makes that decision, not him.

It’s unknown if lie detectors beeped to life across Canada, when the Prime Minister said that on day one of the election campaign. They could have. They should have.

The Clerk serves at the pleasure of the Prime Minister, not the other way around. Trudeau is the boss. That’s not all: decisions of the Prime Minister and his cabinet have the force of law; the Clerk’s doesn’t. Trudeau has true power, not some unelected bureaucrat.

His prevarications are cowardly and craven and dishonest. But they’re not the main reason Justin Trudeau shouldn’t be believed.

The main reason is this: Justin Trudeau, personally, was the one who authorized the February 25, 2019 cabinet decision – number 2019-0105 – to waive confidentiality and permit Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the Justice Committee. Right in the very first line, it said the decision had been made “on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,” quote unquote.

Him, Justin Trudeau. Not some bureaucrat. Not a member of his cabinet. Him.

Justin Trudeau had the power then to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. Now he claims he doesn’t.

He’s lying.

<p>How long the RCMP have been investigating LavScam is unknown. Trudeau and his senior staff lawyered up months ago, so perhaps it’s been that long. But the Mounties are on the case – and Justin Trudeau is doing his utmost to stymie their investigation. He’s adamantly refused to waive the cabinet confidentiality that would let Wilson-Raybould speak to the police.</p>
<p>Reached by the Sun on Friday, Wilson-Raybould said that she has spoken to the police, and more than once. But she says there’s not much she can say to them, or me.</p>
<p>Said Wilson-Raybould to the Sun: “Thanks for your inquiry. I can confirm that I was interviewed by the RCMP on Tuesday of this week. I am not going to comment any further on the nature of those discussions.”</p>
<p>Not because she doesn’t want to, of course. But because Justin Trudeau – the guy who solemnly promised in 2015 to return ethics to Canadian public life – won’t let her. He says the Clerk of the Privy Council – his personal bureaucrat – makes that decision, not him.</p>
<p>It’s unknown if lie detectors beeped to life across Canada, when the Prime Minister said that on day one of the election campaign. They could have. They should have.</p>
<p>The Clerk serves at the pleasure of the Prime Minister, not the other way around. Trudeau is the boss. That’s not all: decisions of the Prime Minister and his cabinet have the force of law; the Clerk’s doesn’t. Trudeau has true power, not some unelected bureaucrat.</p>
<p>His prevarications are cowardly and craven and dishonest. But they’re not the main reason Justin Trudeau shouldn’t be believed.</p>
<p>The main reason is this: Justin Trudeau, personally, was the one who authorized the February 25, 2019 cabinet decision – number <u>2019-0105</u> – to waive confidentiality and permit Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the Justice Committee. Right in the very first line, it said the decision had been made “on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,” quote unquote.</p>
<p>Him, Justin Trudeau. Not some bureaucrat. Not a member of his cabinet. Him.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau had the power then to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. Now he claims he doesn’t.</p>
<p>He’s lying.</p>
<p>And he needs to let her speak – because she knows the truth.</p>

She’s not the only person who gets to determine what is or is not ‘criminal’. Also, she has more to say but is unable to say it because she is being prevented from doing so by Justin Trudeau…what if that information being withheld is evidence of ‘criminal’ behavior? Or even more unethical acts that could spell defeat for the Liberals if revealed?

You just may end up being the one to need those “galloping unicorns” yourself, Bill…

She’s only been allowed to discuss developments up to a certain point, however.

Personally, I think she was being politic rather than completely truthful when she said she thought he hadn’t done anything illegal. At this point we know that’s not true anyway – the Ethics Commissioner made it quite clear that Trudeau *did* violate section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act.

But even if that weren’t true, she was only referring to the pressure put on her to stop the SNC-Lavalin prosecution during the period of the waiver. It doesn’t cover anything after that, and Trudeau is very deliberately keeping her – and everyone else with pertinent information – muzzled.

Stephen,

She simply can’t do that. At the very least JWR would have law society problems were she to seek bar re-admission. JWR cannot violate SCP and CC either. She needs an all-encompassing waiver and Trudeau will never, ever, give her that because he knows full well that it would be his government’s Waterloo. Some people are really not as good a liar as they think they are. Playing Canadians for fools is hardly a winning electoral strategy.

More particularly, Section 70 of the Privacy Act exempts The Queen’s Privy Council for Canada (Federal Cabinet) from the law’s application. However, you can complain to the Privacy Commissioner, or go to Federal Court but your chances are practically zero as courts defer to the well entrenched principle of Cabinet Confidence.

This campaign is going to show the true colours of Trudeau and the Libs. The promise of sunny ways was yet another bullsh*t pledge that falls apart as soon as it is tested. Instead, we will see the usual false accusations of “hidden agendas” and stereotypes of conservatives. And they do it because many voters are stupid enough to fall for it.

The true campaign slogan of the Libs, for many years, is something along the lines of “We will tell you what you want to hear, because you have a crappy memory.”

But the point is that the Liberals are trying to associate Scheer with Goldy through his candidates, and claiming that such past associations prove he’s evil.

The Conservatives are only calling attention to Trudeau’s own past association with her to highlight the Liberals’ hypocrisy.

In fact, Scheer has already taken a stand against this absurd “gotcha” approach to politics. He’s said that he’s going to support candidates who have made inappropriate remarks in the past, as long as they aren’t outrageous, and the candidates have taken responsibility and apologized for them.

But if I’m reading those numbers correctly, the Liberals do still have some forward momentum; just not as much as the Conservatives. It’s not ideal for them, but it’s much better than the negative trends that have taken 3-4 points each from the NDP and Greens.

It’s still early yet, though. And if memory serves, the Conservatives were ahead at one point during the 2015 election too, but peaked too early.

I think 05-06 is the best historical analogy.

Liberals: infighting, ridiculous spending announcements, arrogant, out of touch, pretending everything is great when it isn’t, serious scandal, desperate attacks on obscure statements from obscure candidates…

Tories: Boutique tax credits that people actually will remember at the ballot box. Keeping it bland. Keeping it Tim Hortons crowd. BUT Scheer has nowhere near the ridiculous baggage Harper had in 2006. He also has a very seasoned front bench which will easily slide back into power right where they left off 4 years ago.

How soon we forget the utter rubbish that harper was! Censoring public scientists paid for by the taxpayer, not him, and sending minders along to conferences to make them keep their traps shut if it wasn’t something harper agreed to. Just like the Soviet Union used to do.

The only good thing I see in the man Scheer beyond his apparent low level of intellectuality and probable inability to screw everything up in five minutes like Ford or Kenney, is that he just barely beat out the racist Maxime Bernier for leadership of the Cons. God knows what state this country would be in today with that loose cannon as Leader of the Opposition.

Seems that the scientists are under the *exact same* restrictions that they’ve always been under. RCMP, Canadian Forces, health care personnel and the Civil Service, too. Imagine that…none of them are actually allowed to go on social media (or be interviewed by journalists) and express their concerns about what the government is or is not doing or criticize government policy. The government, you see, IS THEIR EMPLOYER, and just like any other employer they take a very dim view of their employees overstepping their bounds (and rightly so). All the research those ‘scientists’ do? The government OWNS all that research, along with all those laboratories and research facilities they use. They publish, or publicize, only what they are expressly told to.

Now maybe there are independently wealthy “free range” scientists out there who can freely speak on their work any time they choose, but I have never heard of any (Dr. Fruit Fly could be one, but he hasn’t been an actual ‘scientist’ for decades, sorry).

This sort of fundamentally flawed idiocy is what really irks me about the Harper/Scheer types, not the socially conservative statements the libs are dredging up from the ancient past. I don’t fear a social conservative agenda, because I don’t believe it has traction. I do fear visionless, foolish vote buying that will accomplish nothing whatsoever except maybe remind selfish small-minded types that they can get a few hundred extra dollar a year that they don’t goddamn need in the first place when they are in the voting booth.

They’ve already brought out the old “in the pocket of the gun lobby” (really? We have a ‘gun lobby’ in Canada? Who knew?…) after abortion and SSM failed miserably to gain any traction. That’s the Big Three right there; the NDP also use number four (Tax the rich!) but the Liberals are loathe to use that one right now.

A big issue not being as discussed, but prominent in centers like Calgary, is propaganda. Not just the kind directed at politicians, but the kind they use in Calgary to harass and malign folks who like the liberals more than the conservatives. It’s like the kkk reborn. They stoop so low as to confuse reputations – this is such a serious issue because we aren’t free anymore living at the whim of whatever misguided loser feels like pumping out horseshit propaganda just to fuck with you and the reputation you earned

Or more broadly, this idiotic god complex so many have developed to disrupt reality with propaganda and social media to feel better, to pretend they’re better, to attack harass and malign people they’re jealous of – in job applications and everyday life – that’s a crime that disrupts every facet of existence for a losers esteem issues or overzealous ambition – that is a huge issue that should be addressed – this toxic cyber terror every loser depends on to feel better that is terror to the people they target – it amplifies during elections or in tight job applications – and i wonder if the catalyst is illegal surveillance

You can talk about fascism as an abstract concept, but some of us experience cyber fascism everyday, for standing out, for working harder, for believing in something better, for being informed, for overcoming more, for having an education – for having been sporty, or intelligent or liked – they target individuals with a steady stream of horseshit just to quell their human potential – that’s terror and it happens in Calgary every fucking day. Huge crime that goes to the fabric of being Canadian and it’s regular fair in these parts –

I was expecting a complete apology, but didn’t see it. Using the word “makeup” is an attempt at minimization of the incident, and thus renders the apology less than adequate.

Trudeau has a noteworthy habit of befriending pedophiles (Chris Ingvaldson, Frank Giustra, Ben Nevin, Peter Dalglish, the Bronfmans, just for starters).

216,Warren Kinsella,My latest: this isn’t the face of a Prime Minister,2019-09-18 19:42:00,Warren,,"Blackface.

I’ve been writing about, and researching – and opposing – racism for more than thirty years. And make no mistake: blackface isn’t funny.

It’s racist.

Ask Megyn Kelly. A year ago, the former Fox News star was filming a segment about Halloween costumes and “political correctness.” Someone asked whether it was acceptable for a white person to smear black makeup all over their face and pretend to be black.

Here’s what Kelly said: “But what is racist? Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween… Back when I was a kid that was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.”

There was a massive backlash. Kelly apologized. But her show was cancelled not long afterwards.

Just this year, Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, faced demands that she resign because audio of a skit emerged from when she was in college – even though the person in blackface was her then-fiance. Not her.

Ivey still apologized.

Also this year: upscale fashion brand Gucci fired its global head of diversity because he hadn’t stopped a “balaclava jumper” from going on sale. The jumper featured an image that resembled blackface.

In Canada, we’ve experienced blackface backlash, too. Theatre impresario Robert Lepage faced protests when one of his plays apparently contained scenes that recalled blackface. Some University of Montreal students wore blackface to “pay tribute” to champion runner Usain Bolt. The university was forced to apologize for that.

So why is blackface so controversial? Why is what Justin Trudeau has done so wrong?

Because blackface is literally about white people caricaturing black people. It recalls the era when blacks were referred to as “darkies” and “coons.” It was something popularized in minstrel shows to suggest that blacks were inferior to whites. That they were stupider. That they were deserving of derision and mockery.

David Leonard, a professor at Washington State University, and an expert on the manifestations of racism, says this: “It’s an assertion of power and control. It allows a society to routinely and historically imagine African Americans as not fully human. It serves to rationalize violence and segregation.”

Is Justin Trudeau racist?

Well, his appalling treatment of a proud indigenous woman, Jody Wilson-Raybould, didn’t exactly suggest Trudeau was nearly as tolerant as he regularly claims to be. When asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that four Democratic politicians “go back” to the “crime infested places” they came from, Justin Trudeau refused to say Trump’s racist statements were in fact racist.

Said Trudeau: “Canadians and indeed people around the world know exactly what I think about those particular comments.”

Do we really?

After Canadians have looked at that shocking photo of the Liberal prime minister mocking and denigrating black people – after the embarrassment and shame he has now brought on Canada internationally – it’s hard to know exactly what Justin Trudeau was thinking. Or if he thinks at all.

At the end of this shocking revelation, we are left with one thought: this is not the face of a prime minister.

Like Megyn Kelly, Justin Trudeau’s little show needs to be cancelled, once and for all.

Trudeau’s big problem is that this is not a one-off incident. He already admitted that black-face is a two-off incident.
But there is also the groping of Rose Knight.
There is him telling indigenous chiefs that if they think they need community centres, they are wrong because the youths really need places to store their canoes. Completely stereotyping a race.
There is Trudeau dressing in Indian garb – no skin colouring, but still cultural appropriation.
There is Trudeau mixing up Japanese PM as Chinese – essentially saying all Asian look alike.

Old and New examples
Racist and Sexist and Misogynistic examples.

The first book I ever read was Black Like Me. Mocking black people with racist caricature has historically been a very real part of our racist ancestry & sociological existence in Canada.
It gradually became antisocial but was once acceptable to the elite even of Toronto where I experienced racism towards black Torontonians when I was growing up.

I was raised not to tolerate racism as you were, Warren. Unfortunately, it existed in the schools in Toronto in the 60s.
Ottawa has had many racist incidents since I moved here in the 70s. We just got our first black City of Ottawa councillor about seven moths ago and we just got our first black Chief of Police a month ago too.

Transitioning to a culture of tolerance for all ethnicities is a challenge to be sure when incidents keep cropping up when they should not be cropping up at all.

Genuine? No. Contrite? No.

He and his inner circle obviously think that as along as they stay on message, they can get out of this. There was nothing even remotely sincere about it; it was all messaging strategy.

Was it a perfect apology? Absolutely not. Was it contrived? Probably. Let’s call it a first attempt where there is plenty of room for improvement.

Only a blithering idiot in the PMO, or elsewhere, could possibly think that this is even remotely recoverable. Trudeau needs to weigh very seriously whether he should remain as party leader. Whether he stays, or goes, Canadians will definitely have their say next month.

Trudeau needs to seriously look in the mirror and make the best decision he can in the interest of Canada and Canadians. I hope he’s up to it.

Warren well said And written thanks for speaking up and your honesty, I know you have spoke on this subject for many years.
warren why is it the msm is using the term brownface and not using blackface of which it is.
and also i find it hard to believe in todays ways of data research that this pic has not been around for awhile and has been silenced by the msm in canada, how is it a US media finds this and produces it.
I of course agree with what you have said about racism but its more he is the biggest liar i can remember in the liberal party, and we have seen some whoppers.
thanks again for what you said, you nailed it.

They are saying brownface because he is supposed to be dressed up as a Middle Eastern person, although his makeup appears black.

My question is, who was still taking black and white photos in 2001?

Because yearbook photos back then were mostly printed in black and white. I’m sure a color one is out there somewhere buried in someone’s closet.

I graduated from highschool in 1999. Yearbook photos were black and white. I forgot if ALL the event photos were b/w, might have been a mix between b/w and colour.

As uncomfortable as I am with the modern penchant for digging out old tweets, Facebook posts and high school year books and then throwing the offender to a howling mob of the super-woke (I’m starting to see it as a millenial plot to clear out the Boomers), this is really over the top for a teacher in 2001. It’s hard to know whether blacks or women should be more offended. And we thought Kavanaugh was a sleazy party animal! But my question is how could anyone think he could rise to the top of political heights in the second decade of the 21st century without this coming back to haunt him. Did his brain trust know about it? Did they think he could just duck it and nobody would notice? When did he start feeling pissed off at himself, yesterday?

I just watched Trudeau’s emergency press conference.

He is amazingly shameless.

I mean, I already knew he was shameless. But this… this is beyond anything I could have have imagined. He just keeps repeating the same obviously pre-rehearsed words: “I made a
mistake in my youth… case-by-case basis… conversations… I am deeply sorry… I take full responsibility…”. No change in expression, no answer to questions that doesn’t cycle back to these same words.

No change in expression. None.

If he wins the election after this… what does it say about us as a country?

Are they?

You would think so, but you’d also think that Liberals wouldn’t be out there shamelessly attempting classic DARVO techniques, either. You’d expect them to be genuinely embarrassed… and yet it seems that the vast majority are only making a token expression of disappointment or disapproval, and then going straight to the standard deflections and excuses.

If they do even the token expression of disappointment or disapproval, that is. I’m seeing a truly shocking number of people angrily dismissing this as a “nothingburger” or right-wing plot. Just like they did for SNC-Lavalin.

If a good number of people can be as utterly shameless as that, will this really have any effect? I guess we’ll see when the next poll comes out…

See, it would normally be forgiveable in high school, when he wasn’t even a legal adult. If he had volunteered the information earlier, and taken responsibility for it, and apologized. Then there would be no problem – people would already have forgotten about it, more likely than not.

But his stunning hypocrisy in trying to slime the Conservatives as racist for similar (or even lesser) past transgressions is just too much.

So shockingly stupid and so low class, and so completely lacking in any kind of empathy for others. I would never have been able to bring myself to do something like that, and if I had, my parents would have probably cleaned my face off with a deck brush, certainly my father, being Navy, would have.

In 1964, I was a teenager, we got the talk about racism, when Dad brought home a black South African soccer player, and a white German soccer player for lunch. He was the Chief of Staff for physical education on the Navy base Cornwallis, and had organized an international sports meet. So he brought these two men home, raved about their soccer ability, and as we all sat around the living room, he told us that if we were in S. Africa, we would all have been thrown in jail, because black and white people weren’t allowed to socialize.
That was a shock to me, at 14, and I never forgot it. We got the racism talk that day, and other days as well, and were introduced to the music of Miriam Makeba, Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles, and were aware of the way black people in Nova Scotia were treated. Of course the civil rights movement was also happening. This was in Nova Scotia. My father was a Navy PTI. He had no special education, but he was able to make us aware of racism – one would think that Pierre Trudeau, at that time, could have made his children aware, but apparently he didn’t bother.

Hey Warren, now seems like a good time to tell the story of Justin Trudeau on Oct 22, 2014, the day of the shooting on the Hill.

Long story short, everyone had been moved into the 5th floor cafeteria in Centre Block. Mostly staff and media cause CPC and NDP caucus had already begun by the time of the lockdown. But LPC caucus starts later so they were having their pre-caucus meeting in their leader’s office on the 6th floor.

They moved everyone to caf throughout the day before evacuation later that night. Anyway, at one point an East Asian man walked in to the cafeteria. He had a big beard and wore a turban.

Trudeau jumped up and joked rather loudly; “Hey there you are. You know they’re looking for you out there. Hey you’re making everyone in here nervous!”

He obviously knew the man, he was a liberal staffer. The man seemed to take the joke well but that’s not really the point. Those of us who heard it looked at each other in shock.

The arrest of a top RCMP intelligence agent linked to Phampton based in Richmond BC who sold encrypted devices to Hell Angels drug cartels and other criminal organizations and an MP of the Liberal party stripped of his law firm and has allégations of money laundering for drug kingpin of the Big Circle Boys.

He’s an entitled, spoiled, arrogant narcissist, coddled all his life, sheltered from the “common folks” he claims to defend. The only thing that’s genuine about him is he’s an actor; he LOVES to pretend… about everything.

The main focus is the corruption scandals left and right and the cover ups. Groping of women IS not COSPLAY Neither is smoking dope with students or involved in child pornography ring if the rumours are true So stay tuned and you might want to buy some eye wash if the rumours are true. I for one think Trudeau might have a fantasy of looking like his Caribbean dad. He must of overheard who his real daddy is so he leaned towards dressing up that way. Another rumour too but he sure looks like Fidel. You know psychological triggers. But corruption is very différent.

210,Warren Kinsella,My latest: Justin Trudeau likens black people to apes. Don’t let him get away with that,2019-09-19 09:30:00,Warren,,"An ape?

The video is grainy. It’s blurry, and it’s hard to make out who is in it.

But we don’t have to guess. The Liberal Party of Canada has confirmed to Global News – which released the video on Thursday morning – that it depicts Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Canada.

Acting like an ape.

In the video, he’s covered (again) in blackface. He really worked at it, too: he made certain to smear dark make-up on his face, neck, ears, arms. Even his legs. We can see through the holes in his jeans that he did that.

There are three photographs, now, of Trudeau in blackface. One from his high school days in Montreal, and two from a party at the high school he taught at in Vancouver. With his hand on an unidentified young woman’s chest.

He was about thirty in that last photo. He was someone who taught kids – who was supposed to be setting an example for kids.

But we digress. Back to the video.

In the video, Justin Trudeau is seen for only a few fleeting seconds. There’s no sound. But it is unmistakable what the future Prime Minister of Canada and his pals are doing.

Trudeau’s acting like an ape. Sticking out his tongue, waving around his arms, shuffling around like a simian would, in a zoo or a jungle or something.

I showed the video to my shocked colleagues when they came into the office. Two of them are card-carrying Liberals. They agree with me: Justin Trudeau was in blackface, acting like an ape.

Now, why would he do that?

Brent Staples is a member of the editorial board of the New York Times. Around the time Roseanne Barr called an advisor to Barack Obama the progeny of an ape, Staples wrote an extensive study about that. About how racists like to depict black people as apes.

Like Justin Trudeau did.

Here’s Staples: “[It’s] one of the oldest and most profoundly racist slanders in American history…This depiction — promoted by slave traders, historians and practitioners of “scientific” racism — was used to justify slavery, lynching and the creation of the Jim Crow state…[It’s] the ape caricature.”

Throwing bananas at black public figures. Making noises like apes at public events. Calling Michelle Obama “an ape in heels.” It’s all aimed at one simple, incontrovertible message: that black people areanimals. That they are less than whites. That they belong in cages.

At this point – and with the Trudeau in blackface leading newscasts around the planet – the evidence cannot be rebutted: the Prime Minister of Canada, as man and not just a boy, traded in the foulest racist stereotypes. He thought it was funny. He thought he could get away with it.

So, that’s him: he’s the scum of the Earth. He doesn’t deserve to be elected dogcatcher, let alone a Prime Minister of a G7 country.

Oddly, the issue isn’t him. It’s now the members of the Liberal Party. It’s us.

Will Liberal MPs now publicly condemn their “leader,” as I counselled two distressed Grit MPs to do this morning? They must.

And, Canadians, too, have a decision to make. Will we let him get away with it? Trudeau and his loathsome coterie are laying low, clearly believing this all will blow over in time. And it might, you know.

It is up to us – Canadians – to say: not good enough. Not on. Not this time.

Justin Trudeau – the goddamned Prime Minister of Canada – is on a video, this morning, joking that black people are, you know, apes.

<p>An <em>ape?</em></p>
<p>The video is grainy. It’s blurry, and it’s hard to make out who is in it.</p>
<p>But we don’t have to guess. The Liberal Party of Canada has confirmed to Global News – which released the video on Thursday morning – that it depicts Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
<p>Acting like an ape.</p>
<p>In the video, he’s covered (again) in blackface. He really worked at it, too: he made certain to smear dark make-up on his face, neck, ears, arms. Even his legs. We can see through the holes in his jeans that he did that.</p>
<p>There are three photographs, now, of Trudeau in blackface. One from his high school days in Montreal, and two from a party at the high school he taught at in Vancouver. With his hand on an unidentified young woman’s chest.</p>
<p>He was about thirty in that last photo. He was someone who <em>taught kids</em> – who was supposed to be setting an example for kids.</p>
<p>But we digress. Back to the video.</p>
<p>In the video, Justin Trudeau is seen for only a few fleeting seconds. There’s no sound. But it is unmistakable what the future Prime Minister of Canada and his pals are doing.</p>
<p>Trudeau’s acting like an ape. Sticking out his tongue, waving around his arms, shuffling around like a simian would, in a zoo or a jungle or something.</p>
<p>I showed the video to my shocked colleagues when they came into the office. Two of them are card-carrying Liberals. They agree with me: Justin Trudeau was in blackface, acting like an ape.</p>
<p>Now, why would he do that?</p>
<p>Brent Staples is a member of the editorial board of the <em>New York Times</em>. Around the time Roseanne Barr called an advisor to Barack Obama the progeny of an ape, Staples wrote an extensive study about that. About how racists like to depict black people as apes.</p>
<p>Like Justin Trudeau did.</p>
<p>Here’s Staples: “[It’s] one of the oldest and most profoundly racist slanders in American history…This depiction — promoted by slave traders, historians and practitioners of “scientific” racism — was used to justify slavery, lynching and the creation of the Jim Crow state…[It’s] the ape caricature.”</p>
<p>Throwing bananas at black public figures. Making noises like apes at public events. Calling Michelle Obama “an ape in heels.” It’s all aimed at one simple, incontrovertible message: that black people are<em> animals.</em> That they are <em>less</em> than whites. That they belong in <em>cages.</em></p>
<p>At this point – and with the Trudeau in blackface leading newscasts around the planet – the evidence cannot be rebutted: the Prime Minister of Canada, as man and not just a boy, traded in the foulest racist stereotypes. He thought it was funny. He thought he could get away with it.</p>
<p>So, that’s him: he’s the scum of the Earth. He doesn’t deserve to be elected dogcatcher, let alone a Prime Minister of a G7 country.</p>
<p>Oddly, the issue isn’t him. It’s now the members of the Liberal Party. It’s <em>us.</em></p>
<p>Will Liberal MPs now publicly condemn their “leader,” as I counselled two distressed Grit MPs to do this morning? <em>They must.</em></p>
<p>And, Canadians, too, have a decision to make. Will we let him get away with it? Trudeau and his loathsome coterie are laying low, clearly believing this all will blow over in time. And it might, you know.</p>
<p>It is up to us – Canadians – to say: <em>not good enough. Not on. Not this time.</em></p>
<p>Justin Trudeau – the goddamned Prime Minister of Canada – is on a video, this morning, joking that black people are, you know, apes.</p>
<p>This man is unfit. We, Canadians, must line up on October 21 and reject him and his ways.</p>
<p>We must.</p>

I still think we are missing a potentially bigger political story here. Specifically how prime ministerial Jagmeet Singh, a real victim of this type of racism, looks in his mature response to this situation. The contrast between him and Trudeau could not be more sharp.

One week ago, Singh and the NDP were struggling for relevancy this campaign. The general narrative was that they were being replaced by the rising Green Party.

Today, Mr Singh looks like a Prime Minister.

Ronald O'Dowd says: 

September 21, 2019 at 1:58 pm

Mark,

Agreed, absolutely. Singh must take Trudeau to the woodshed in the debates. But to pull it off and lead his party out of the wilderness, it must be done without being sanctimonious. Otherwise it flops entirely, without the proper balance.

C’est une question de nuances. A question of degree.

I think JS stating he would discuss the incident with JT only if it was in private and not politicized was the perfect response on Mr Singh’s part.

September 21, 2019 at 3:10 pm

I wouldn’t go as far as to call him Prime Ministerial because of this one occasion. But yes, his response was excellent, and deservedly raised his stature.

And that’s a big, BIG problem for the Liberals.

Mark D says: 

September 22, 2019 at 5:06 am

I’m not saying Mr Singh is ready to be prime minister yet, or that he will win enough seats for the NDP to form government. Rather I am saying his response to this affair *looks* prime ministerial.

That is, it’s mature, it’s thoughtful, it draws upon his own experiences, and it speaks to the deeper heart of Canadians. I particularly appreciated how Singh had the foresight to appeal to young Canadians of colour and minority cultures not to give up on Canada. And he looked sincere rather than sanctimonious in doing so.

The contrast between the NDP leader and the prime minister could not have been more sharp. Which is what I mean by Mr Singh looking prime ministerial. I may disagree with 90 percent of the NDP policies, but I do a fair bit of international travel and Mr Singh is someone I am comfortable with representing all Canadians on the world stage.

An NDP federal government would be such a financial disaster that we will never see it happen (thank god). That said, I am very happy to see them take a higher percentage of the vote, because they are taking most of it from the Liberals.

Warren do you think the media other than Sun is either way too sympathetic for Trudeau or straight up in the bag for him? The difference in tone between the international media and Canadian is pretty telling on this story. Why is nobody in the MSM bringing up the fact he was wearing a banana t shirt with a cod piece in his pants in full blackface? I am one of the last people to ever play the racist card but if that isn’t racist I don’t know what is.

I think he will be stepping down soon as the leader. News stations across the world have picked it up. I agree with Derrick Snowdy. Its not his cosplay that is concerning the most but its where his hands are on the young girl. Was his friend Ingvaldson a bad associate? Was he smoking dope with his students? All these rumours circulating on the net that the RCMP know are true or not. You can only cover up so much then it unravels. The RCMP being made to look real bad now.

On the subject of NDP leaders and campaigns…

I don’t want to reduce this situation to crass politics. Nor in anyway do I believe or suggest the NDP is behind this scandal. I think these photos are coming out at an ideal time for NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

Up until then, the narrative had been Singh is uninspiring and the Green Party is rising at the expense of the NDP, as Singh and the NDP struggle to connect with voters.

Race and multiculturalism are topics where Singh connects at his deepest and his strongest with the general population. It is an issue where he is at his most mature, his most insightful, where he looks his most *prime ministerial*.

In sum, if we are to compare this to the PC’s “Is this the face of a prime minister?” debacle, this is Mr Singh’s Jean Chretien moment. And Mr Singh is handling it like a mature statesman and leader.

Reply


Mark D says: 

September 21, 2019 at 6:16 am

Put another way, Warren asks the question of JT in brown face: “Is this the face of a prime minister?”

In light of Mr Singh’s mature response to this incident, we should also be asking ourselves the same question of the NDP leader: “Is this the face of a prime minister?”

I believe the answer is Yes. For the first time this campaign, the NDP leader appears prime ministerial because of the sensitivity, sincerity and maturity with which he has responded to this incident–in direct contrast to our prime minister’s immaturity.

Justin showed his true colors after he was first elected I believe he was the poorest attending member in the house.It soon became evident why , because he was traveling around Canada on speaking tours , charging to speak in some cases for thousands of dollars. Finally someone became wise to this and I believe that he was shamed into refunding his last engagement. There just isn’t much honourable about him period.

Trudeau continues to do the impossible:1) he made the World forget about Trump for one day. He bumped Trump from the headlines. The Donald will not be happy.
2) he enhanced his chances of being elected by distracting people away from LavSCAM. By replacing it with racism. Gerry Butts is brilliant! And Trudeau has the drama chops to offer up the teary apology.

For me, I’m focusing on the former Liberal Cabinet Ministers. Is there not one amongst them with an ounce of integrity, sincerity and ethical values? Now is the time for someone from within to step up to the podium and unequivocally condemn Trudeau’s behavior and duplicity. The whole country is watching – he will not fire you. He cannot fire you. Now is the time to feel embolden, to grow a backbone. Or forever explain to your grandchildren why it happened on your watch, and you did nothing. Said nothing but fawning, sycophantic platitudes.

Lastly, a direct challenge to our current Prime Minister! Now that your blindspot is gone, now that you “get it”, now that you want to be a leader and an ally, there is one thing you CAN do to prove you accept full responsibility and want to do better… make our country a better place for visible minorities! Call for the repeal of Quebec’s racist Bill 21. It would take you and Gerry Butts and Katie T just an hour to draft up the new Liberal “Woke” policy to reduce racism in Canada. Simple. Just gotta have the deeds to match your words. (Warren you have the platform and respect to call Trudeau to this action. What say yea?)

Justin has a fetish. He is uncomfortable being a white English speaking Canadian. He calls himself a ‘Montrealer” or a Quebecois even though he was born in Ottawa, raised in Ontario and spent many adult years I B.C. He has no culture, hence the endless costuming and dress-up.

When a 1984 photo of Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) in blackface surfaced earlier this year, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, ex-VA governor Terry McAuliffe and the NAACP all called for him to resign.
So Canadians are saying the progressive Democrats who took a stand against blackface were wrong? The NAACP was wrong?
Why would Democrats call on one of there own to resign over blackface, rather than make excuses for him? Is it because American progressives are really against racism. but Canadian “progressives” are posers?

How so you ask? Damn fine acting. Justin drew deep into his reservoir of acting skills and somehow, someway managed to convince us – with his impeccable acting skills – that he is a victim. A victim of his own privilege. Remarkable!

“Justin Trudeau and an Inconvenient Truth.” A privileged victim.The movie will be produced by Harvey Weinstein. Johnny Depp rumored to play the role of Po’ Justin. The book will be ghost written by Gerry Butts, with the foreward by Michael Wernick.

Vancouverois,

You’ve been around politics for a long time. You know a few self-evident truths that always apply, namely: winning is not only everything, it’s also the only thing. That’s the common truth. But it comes with house rules: how you win is critical. Honour, decency, telling it exactly as it is are absolute requirements under that political maxim and to laugh or blatently and quite deliberately disregard those constructs is to lose power in a big way. That’s politically inevitable. The Canadian people are what makes this country great and when they’ve finally had enough, they send the mother-of-all wake-up-calls to our leaders. Happened to Harper in 2015. Coming in spades to Trudeau next month.

Hahahaha! Harvey Weinstein of course! But I suggest the movie be set 20 years into the future, in 2039, with an older post-career Justin reflecting on his life lessons, played by Kevin Spacey. Mel Gibson will play Gerald Butts. Felicity Huffman will be Katie Telford.

In a flashback scene (there will be many), Bill Cosby can do a cameo, playing an offended elderly man who challenges a younger Trudeau when he encounters him in blackface at a party. This can be the “moment of awkening” in Justin’s life when he suddenly becomes aware of the “intersectionality between his privileged upbringing and his unconscious prejudices”.

Not sure who will play the younger Trudeau; it’s a pity Jim Cary is too old. A reprisal of his Mask/Pet Detective/Dumb and Dumber personas would be perfect. After the Bill Cosby encounter, a reflective Justin, still in blackface, could do a tumble down the stairs while a voiceover of his inner thoughts says “I’m not sure who let that blind old ghetto dude in, but maybe he has a point. Maybe the makeup is wrong… I’ve got a closet full of traditional Indian garments that won’t offend anyone, maybe I’ll stick with those from now on…. because it’s 2001”.

Mel Gibson as Butts not right. The older Aussie, Geoffrey Rush would be perfect. For Justin in his youth either Tom Cruise , Depp or Joachim Phoenix. If Spacey is allowed out he’d be fine as older Justin. If not, Jeremy Irons. Katie Telford has to be Meryl Streep’s role. The poor Sophie Gregoire can be portrayed sympathetically by

Trudeau reminds me of Lance Armstrong. When all the signs were out there that Lance was likely cheating, his fan base could simply not believe it or consider there might be another side of the story. He was considered a hero. A survivor. A fighter for all those battling cancer. He gave people hope. His fan base drank his koolaid.

Yet, they stood up for him. Fought back for him. Even after he admitted guilt, his hardcore followers justified that it was okay – that he was simply the best of the cheaters and everyone cheated… so it was okay. It was justified.

His fans chose to ignore the fact that he destroyed people’s careers, their businesses, and their reputations only to simply protect his lies. To protect his wealth. To protect his ego.

He flaunted his accusers (did you see him posing in his house with the 7 yellow jerseys after having his titles stripped?). He feigned distress for what he did.

And he still has his core supporters.

Deja vu… (other than the cancer piece).

I believe Harper and Martin both waived cabinet confidentiality.

I find Trudeau to be a dispicable person. He makes promises he doesn’t keep. He’s condescending. He’s a virtue signalling fool who doesn’t live up to his own standards. He’s vindictive (ref Caesar-Chavannes, AdmNorman, JWR, and Philpott). He’s unethical.

He’s obstructed the investigation into SNC and his ethics violations. His good friend Butts, wouldn’t testify under oath. What are they hiding?

On top of this he’s a liar.

And just recently Chrystia Freeland says she has total confidence in Trudeau.

Is it wise to pick and choose when PM’s waive cabinet confidentiality – when that could really impact how future cabinets function on an array of issues.

Reply


Vancouverois says: 

September 22, 2019 at 10:37 pm

In this case, the precedent has already been set – when there’s a serious ethical charge being brought, the PM waives privilege in the relevant matters fully. Because privilege isn’t meant to allow the government to cover up actual wrongdoing.

Trudeau has failed to honour this precedent. Such waiver as he has granted has been partial, and specifically excludes the period of the most interest.

You can make your own conclusions as to why.





jsa says: 

September 22, 2019 at 10:56 pm

Doctor-patient confidentiality is limited, however. In fact, doctors have a duty to disclose patient information in cases where a patient poses a risk to public safety: unfit drivers, people with certain communicable diseases…

I get your point though, I’ve known at least a couple of old boys that avoided their doctors out of fear of losing their driver’s licences, and I’ll probably be one of them myself, soon enough.

Can’t tell me Gerry Butt’s didn’t know! Can’t tell me the selection committee at the highest level of the LPC didn’t know. If they didn’t know they should have, and ultimately proves Trudeau is a liar and lied by omission to get the job. Lying on his pitifully weak resume would be reason enough to fire him.

Well, as much as I like both of these ladies and their hutzpah and principle, I think it’s time they “spoke their truth” on Trudeau and the SNC Lavalin affair – regardless of Trudeau’s GAG on them. Trudeau thought is was OK for him to speak and not them. While they’re at it, they should give us the ALL the details on Gerald Butt’s, and the PMO. The so called oath was never intended to prevent possible criminal behaviour of the prime minister to go unchallenged. Citizens have a duty to report crime – period. It’s no different than the code of silence within criminal gangs and the neighbourhood where they live. Silence only perpetuates and condones criminality.

I say vote for both of them if it closes the liberal candidate out, but not if the conservative candidate is favoured to win the seat. Trudeau and the liberals do not deserve a second mandate.

Trudeau – Not As Advertised.

Bill,

As explained before, you can’t do that: Philpott is a CPSO member while JWR may at some point seek re-admittance to either the BC or Ontario bars. You simply can’t violate cabinet confidence (like SCP or PC) without it having very serious repercussions as regards your status with the provincial regulating authority.

I think (correct me if I’m wrong) Warren himself and other lawyers and scholars said Trudeau eroded/broke cabinet confidence when he spoke out with his many reincarnations of his story, therefore opening it up to all. And what bigger implication is electing a possibly criminals to form government or at the least as MP’s. Are we a banana republic or do we still have rule of law in Canada? Sometimes you have to do the right thing for “God and Country” as they say!

Trudeau has blocked the RCMP from proceeding with a criminal investigation into SNC as well as the Ethics Commissioner by not providing waiver. Stonewalled and closed down the Ethics Committee – what does Trudeau have to hide that is so Nuclear? This is NOT state secrets, this is a cover up to save Trudeau’s skin from possible criminal charges. Banana Republic, No?

Warren, I will apologize in advance if this puts you on the spot…

I don’t know if you are in a position to discuss Jagmeet Singh’s response to our prime minister’s brown face, or if you are comfortable doing so, but I think a number of your readers (myself included) would be interested in your take.

Personally, I have been extremely impressed by the maturity with which Singh has responded to this situation. Up until this point I had not been impressed by his leadership or by the NDP campaign. But his appeal to minorities not to give up on Canada struck the right nerve with me.

Mark D, why would you be interested in Warren’s take on this specific thing. Can you not form your own “take” on it. It’s pretty clear, and it’s been covered extensively by all major news outlets in various formats and platforms. The overwhelming consensus is that Singh was sincere, believable, struck the right tone, did not attempt to score political points, etc. etc. You need/want more? Time to move on. The question is, will YOU be voting Liberal?

Fred,

That’s a bit of a stretch: Christians — not to mention everyone else in this society are divided on same-sex-marriage. Just because Singh condemns Scheer’s then views does not mean that his condemnation goes beyond Scheer’s comments in that particular time frame and context.

Condemnation is one thing, Ronald…calling those views “disgusting” is quite another.

Scheer at that time felt exactly the same way I did (and still do today): let them have ‘civil unions’ instead like all those European countries did at the time. Let them have the EXACT SAME THING with a different name. It’s called ‘compromise’, and it’s the solution that normal, reasonable people might formulate when called upon to make changes in society that could upset or insult millions of people of various faiths.

Nothing, since I’m a life-long atheist. I’m talking about avoiding deliberately upsetting people who *do* have a religious belief that marriage is sacred.

Believe it or not, Darwin, not everyone is as selfish and self-centered as your typical NDP supporter; many people actually care about the opinions and well being of others even though they don’t share the same beliefs (I know…shocking, right?).

Not too many though. Philpott and W-R certainly count and Singh has finally emerged from hibernation to inspire us all. There are some very impressive characters on the Con front benches, especially the women, and I wish Scheer would make more of his team. Of course the Libs have some good people, but these days they all look like piggies at the trough by defending the indefensible over JT. May and the Greens are much too erratic to qualify. What in the world possessed them to come out for legalizing all drugs? Like there is a big demand across the land for a safe supply of heroin and meth? I already know of one vote they’ve lost over that little gratuitous bombshell.

Almost all of them are locked in a world of bright young handlers, base-feeding, media sound bites, paranoia about polls and gaffes, etc. Meanwhile, like Diogenes, a whole nation craves honest, intelligent men and women of principle and sobriety who can transcend their petty little worlds and guide the ship of state through rocky shoals. Very depressing.

Both the NDP and the Green party has a policy to decriminalize possession of small amounts of drugs (not legalize). It was Singh’s main policy plank that distinguished him during the NDP leadership race. It is modeled after the success of Portugal in encouraging treatment over punishment for drug users.

May’s announcement said nothing about “small amounts. But I get that there is a case to be made for a therapeutic approach as opposed to a criminal one. I’m torn myself about it. But it’s far from a straightforward question and I was really questioning her political savvy in making such a simplistic rallying cry during an election.

Sound familiar? Remember that?

The old-timers do. It was an actual slogan that was deployed in the 1972 federal election campaign. Didn’t work out too well.

In yesterday walks tomorrow, they say, and that is certainly true when one compares 1972 to 2019. The similarities are striking.

• In 1972, a Trudeau led the Liberal Party, as in 2019.
• It was a Liberal majority government seeking another majority, as now.
• Back in 1972, as in 2019, the Conservatives were led by a kind of boring, bland guy who everyone underestimated.
• The Liberals’ 1972 slogan, “the land is strong,” sucked. So does the Liberals’ 2019 slogan, “Choose Forward.” It’s ungrammatical and uninspiring.

But the Justin Trudeau folks are wedded to their crummy slogan, just like Justin’s Dad was to his. Everywhere Trudeau the Younger goes, he robotically repeats the “choose forward” mantra, and no one knows exactly what it means.

That’s never a good idea, politically but it’s potential lethal when a scandal hits – like the blackface scandal. When you have no positive message, it makes it easier for a negative message to take its place. And blackface has.

Is an election won or lost on a slogan? Of course not. But a good one should give voters a pithy idea about what is on offer. Like, you know, “Melts in your mouth, not in your hands.” Or: “Just Do It.” Or: “The Quicker Picker Upper.”

The big problem with “choose forward” is that it actually reminds voters about Justin Trudeau’s biggest problem. Which isn’t LavScam, or the Aga Khan, or Gropegate.

It’s that he hasn’t done what he said he was going to do. And he hasn’t done much at all, really.

Let’s crack open the history book again.

From 1968 to 1972, when his Dad was Prime Minister and enjoying a strong parliamentary majority, lots of things were done: the Just Society, universal health care, regional development, parliamentary reform, bilingualism, multiculturalism, pro-NATOism, multilateralism, staring down separatism and terrorism.

When you examine the elder Trudeau’s first majority term – and whether you respected him or not, and this writer really did – it is remarkable how much was accomplished in a relatively short period of time.
But, despite all that, Pierre Trudeau was still reduced to a minority in 1972.

His son, meanwhile, doesn’t have much to brag about, legislatively. Legalization of cannabis, and … that’s it.

History will not remember Justin Trudeau for lots of important legislative achievements, because there haven’t been any. It’s been a lot of social media sizzle, but not much policy steak.

Broken promises and voter disappointments: they’re not predicaments unknown to incumbent governments, true.
But, if there’s enough of them, they’re why those governments get defeated.

And, at this point, Justin Trudeau isn’t known for any achievements at all. He’s known for being a racist, and wearing blackface.

Pierre Trudeau wasn’t defeated in 1972. But, despite a lot of legislative achievements, he almost was. He, the Northern Magus, lost his Parliamentary majority to the efforts of Bob Stanfield – who, like Andrew Scheer, was regularly mocked and maligned.

“Choose Forward” strongly implies that what preceded it wasn’t all that great. In Justin Trudeau’s case, he wants us to think of mean old Stephen Harper when we think about that past.

But what if voters start thinking about the more-recent past – and what, if anything, Justin Trudeau has achieved?

He hasn’t achieved much. There’s a reason why Justin Trudeau is less popular than Donald Trump, you know.

The land is strong? When compared to something like “choose forward,” the 1972 Liberal campaign slogan is practically a detailed 100-page policy platform.

Canadians are going to “choose,” alright.

Based upon his paltry, puny legislative record – based on his racist blackface stunts – Justin Trudeau may deeply regret asking Canadians to do so","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Couple of things. Actually a few..

Everyone’s talking about the blackface, not many talking about the creeping pinky / grope. Who puts their hand on a woman like that posing for a picture? I’ll tell you who..

There are 3 known occasions of him doing blackface. Over a period of years. This is not a one time thing, this is more like an avid hobby. Why is he not being grilled on this, like say, how Harper would have been had similar images of him in blackface surfaced?

Does anyone seriously think CDN Media did not have these pics before TIME released them? This is probably the most disturbing thing. Why does Trudeau hold cult-leader like power over the media that they keep giving him passes?

ONE incident of blackface would have finished the career of any other politician in the country. Trudeau has THREE and we know there is more out there simply by his refusal to acknowledge whether there is or not. Yet he survives – WHY IS THIS?

He had a reputation at the posh private school he worked at, for womanizing the staff and being overly handsy with some students. He roomed with a pedophile who used their dwelling for some of his crimes, who was also being groomed for the liberal party until his crime became public. Yet the media is strangely silent on this. Can anyone imagine any other politician getting leeway from the media like this?

His reasons for leaving the school are foggy, why isn’t the media digging into this?

It’s all a tad disturbing, no?

Trudeau would have been gone a long time ago if it wasn’t for the support of the Trudeau apologist media.

Also, I’m surprised more people aren’t questioning the way he’s holding the woman in the photo. This is not the way a man who “respects women” acts. The term “hover hand” exists for a reason.

My take on Trudeau the Younger is that he tried to institute gender parity in the legislature but failed when he pushed his strongest caucus members out on the Lav-Scam arbitrage deal gone awry.

The marijuana legislation was expected anyways so I don’t really think that is a true success.

In terms of adding up his current successes at this juncture I am at a loss. Positive attributes of his leadership seem to be absent but he must have some qualities aside from nice hair.

How someone like Justine Trudeau can get to the top of politics in Canada without the appropriate vetting process is beyond moi.

Frankly, even if one wants to work for the Government of Canada as an employee there is a vetting process that is fairly stringent IMHO. Nothing gets by RCMP security assessment & vetting for employment. They do their homework on every prospect for employment but somehow everyone missed the vetting process for Prime Minister Trudeau and his antisocial past history & behaviour.

Bottom line is that I know I am naïve when it comes to politicians but I never assumed that the RCMP were as dumb as I am when it comes to the vetting process.

P.S. The ‘quicker picker upper’ line made me laugh & chuckle like I have not laughed in a while, Warren. Thanks for the levity today. After the last few days of unhappiness I needed that chuckle.

I’m no fan of Trudeau but I don’t think the RCMP vet any MP, nor should they. Anyone who is eligible to run in an election and manages to win has gone through all the vetting that is required. It’s up to voters, media, and competing political parties to find this bad stuff before election day. Blackface is stupid, repugnant, insipid, but not illegal.

Time Magazine was responsible for the release of the previously unseen photos that were never vetted by media in Canada at all. If the Liberals had vetted the photos and gave the go ahead for Trudeau to be party leader why were they caught off guard for the timed release by Time Magazine?

Why did the Liberal Party not ensure that they would not be tripped up by an American news corporation like Time Mag if they really did know about the photos before hand?

Would it not be prudent for the RCMP to safeguard Parliament by vetting all future PMs for embarrassing & degrading photos that could damage the office of the Prime Minister if they were released to media in the manner that Time Mag released these photos to disrupt our election and possibly topple government?

Did we all fail to learn the lessons of J. Edgar Hoover?

“Choose Forward” But, But Harper!

The Trudeau government can’t run on their record, so they want you to forget their abject failure and broken promises over the past 4 years – too long to list, but someone will no doubt help me out here. Going Forward, Canada “will be Back ” as soon as we remove Mr. Trudeau from office in October. Trudeau has gotten away with more lies, corruption, groping and downright hypocrisy than any PM in the history of Canada. His Blackface era spanned decades, with possibly more evidence to follow? But this is not enough to convince the Trudeau cult of his total unsuitability to lead this country. He’s singlehandedly made Canada a laughingstock to the rest of the world.

Let’s “choose” to show Mr. Trudeau the exit door come October – he was clearly Not As Advertised!

By the way, I’m one of those who don’t approve of most of Pierre Trudeau’s policy “accomplishments.” However, I always respected him as a tough and principled man of consequence.

Likewise. Official multiculturalism has been a disaster and official bilingualism isn’t much better; both have done nothing but divide the country. P.E. Trudeau’s arrogance, his love of Castro, his riding around Montreal with a Nazi helmet on, his open disdain for the west and a few other character failings should have made him a one-term wonder, but his intellect, charisma and leadership ability made him a force to be reckoned with, as you say.

I remember feeling a certain amoutnt of “Trudeaumania” myself even though I was still in high school at the time and before I really understood what politics were all about.

They may think they can hold on as his Dad did in ’72, only to come back big in ’74. The fantasy could also include losing in ’79, only to Welcome us to the 1980s in ’80.

But, of course, they are full of shit. Justin Trudeau is not nearly the person required to pull off either scenario. I hated P-E-T’s incredible arrogance and being royally full of himself — but like him, or loathe him, the man WAS something to behold. Justin? Not so much.

Also, interesting these days to see Progressives defending racism and racists. One day that dog is going to come back and bite them all in the arse!
And do you think ant of those doing this will admit that if it was Scheer, they’d be demanding his resignation immediately and arming the villagers with pitchforks and torches?

J.H.,

You know me. Not exactly Harper’s poodle in the past but I digress. In any event, I think it’s a totally reasonable and a fair statement to say that if this was Scheer (or MacKay) or anyone else as CPC leader, most of the media would be on it in a nuclear New York-minute. And what’s far worse is that they won’t even acknowledge their own internal biases to themselves — much less to the Canadian people. (Same for Connie on the Trump side, by the way.)

The name of the teacher he was groping was Mariam Matossian. No Canadian media has mentioned her name. Why is that? Why don’t they ask her about the picture?

Also learned from foreign media is that many people were disturbed by what they saw but didn’t say anything because he is Justin Trudeau. The privilege is not race, it’s wealth and power. He was free to be a racist fool because of his name. Now the left wants us to give him a pass because he’s rich and powerful? What are they thinking? This is setting their causes back decades.

Some 500 guests showed up, the men in tuxedos. Except Mr Trudeau. He had painted his face, hands and feet black, donned billowing robes, and placed a giant turban on his head. Not one other person was in blackface.

If Mr Trudeau felt any embarrassment at his jaw-dropping and racially offensive faux pas, then he didn’t show it.

I’m kind of surprised, and disappointed, that JT isn’t being hammered harder for lying his face off about the budget deficit(s).

It seems that fiscal responsibility is out of fashion these days, particularly among those who consider themselves progressive. Which means we may well drive ourselves into another debt/deficit ditch like we did in the early 90s. Which was no fun at all. But I guess historical awareness is out of fashion these days as well.

This is a bit random, but speaking of “POSITIVE” I just remembered this anti-racism speech from the Hollywood movie We Were Soldiers. It is based on the all-too-real battle of Ia Drang, the first pitched battle of the Vietnam war to involved large units of the American and North Vietnamese armies.

In the casting, they went out of their way to choose actors who not only reflected the ethnic diversity within the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and supporting units, they even went out of their way to choose actors who looked like the men who fought in the battle.

Now, you may not like Mel Gibson much these days, in part due to an ethnic tirade he engaged in. Nonetheless, the character he plays, Lt. Gen. Harold “Hal” Moore (deceased), seems to have been one heck of an effective military leader and generally decent man. I’ve read his books, more than once, and been challenged and inspired. I’ll need to read them (especially On Leadership) again to get more challenged and more inspired and do better, but I digress.

Of special note here, over Moore’s career right from his days as a West Point cadet, he was very opposed to and actively campaigned against racism within the American military specifically and society generally. I can’t see Hal Moore cavorting about in blackface three+ times in his life. Can you?

Justin Trudeau is no Hal Moore.

To paraphrase Lloy Bentsen, ” Prime Minister, we KNEW Pierre Trudeau. Justin, you are NO Pierre Trudeau.” I grew up with PET as PM in Windsor with Liberal heavyweights like Martin Sr., Gray, McQuiggan and Whelan and I STILL became a lifelong Conservative. That said, PET was a country-changing Prime Minister of uncanny political instincts, a brutally effective delegator of responsibility and great legal mind. I didn’t agree with him but, he was great. That we have to thank the current Liberal brain-trust for using him and his name and that legacy for the merde we’ve seen for the past almost 4 years makes me yearn for PET, or a man of that, yeah, integrity.

I’m not here to troll.
But when your guy is getting skewered, and rightly so, across the world’s headlines, and on late night US tv, it is time to throw in the towel.
The Liberal party has to make a principled decision, at this very awkward time, and fire JT and replace him with an intern leader. I don’t care who, get Ralph, recall Stephany from where ever he is, (I don’t recommend Freeland….) put an electrolyte iv into Sheila for a week and see if her doctor will ok it… anybody….
Seriously though, if Quebec pulls the Liberals even into a minority government, with the Greens or now the NDP propping them up, that will be bad news and make people furious, and I remember the “Stop Harper” and all the press about how Harper was evil.

Trudeau’s CBC tackled the Maclean’s magazine story this morning. No mention that the supporter of the Syrian dictator attended fundraisers for Justin and the Liberal Party, that he donated money to Justin and the Liberal Party, or that he had a meeting and photo with Justin. They did report that Global Affairs Minister Freeland is shocked by the comments from the Trudeau approved Syrian hon. consul. She wants us to believe that she and her dept. knew nothing about it. In other words she knows nothing about his close Liberal ties. Just like she wants us to believe that Justin is not racist for wearing blackface.

I am going to start with a simple statement I am a baby boomer white male that votes conservative. There no hiding behind my allegiances.
It is a very sad state of affairs, you have a public figure, not just any public figure but the freaking prime minister of the freaking country caught in what has been judged by decades as a racist act THREE times, Yet the public perception if you believe polls is that of “would rather vote for a racist fool than save the environment” or “would rather vote for a racist fool then support a small c conservative” or worse of all “would rather vote for a racist fool then support a left wing leader from a visible minority”. Nary a wimper from liberal cabinet ministers and MPs and candidates. All whom it would seem would rather serve a racist fool and stay in power than depose him, or even mildly opposed him. Warren as a liberal you are very lonesome in your condemnation which shows your own moral compass is well tuned even if we disagree politically.
I won’t give Trudeau a pass, simple, he has smothered with arrogance the compassion that was my father and grandfather’s liberal party. He would give no quarter to old comments about Conservatives while out-lefting the NDP. He is an opportunist and like Donald Trump he has figured out just how to dupe the nation into thinking he is the best choice for leader.
My five year old dead cat is a better leader today. But the people of Canada seem (if you can believe polls) to have not just given Trudeau a pass, they have rallied around a substance free racist idiot.
My own personal fight to stand up to Trudeau with $500,000 thrown in will still leave me millions short of the message that needs to be broadcast. My money is staying in my pocket and not supporting any party because none seems capable of exploiting the incompetence of the man.
All I can say is people have turned a blind eye to many things and have elected horrible persons around the globe. Looks like Canada is not that unique after all.
Turdo is not Hitler, not even Donald Trump but he is sucking the grey matter from all who chant his name.
Society is not in a very good place when Jagmeet Singh, Liz May, and Andrew Scheer are not viewed worth choosing to oppose this racist idiot.
Someday we will have all had enough,I hope that day does not usher in an extreme populist from right or left but I fear one day we will vote selfishly for ourselves and not for the good of the nation. Liberal silence has me begging the question whose qualified and has the integrity to replace him?
Divide and conquer served Rome pretty well and the country will burn here too while some fool fiddles.

199,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: the speech Justin Trudeau should have given, but won’t",2019-09-24 07:17:00,Warren,,"My fellow Liberals, my fellow Canadians.

Last week, I spoke about the scandal that has hit my campaign. I didn’t do it right, so I’m now going to try again.

First things first: over and over, I used the wrong pronoun. I talked about how “we,” as a country, need to do better. How “we” need to be less racist.

I got that wrong. I shouldn’t have said “we.” I should have said “I.” Because I – not we – was the one who smeared stuff all over my face and my body and mocked black people.

It was I – not we – who was racist. Me. Repeatedly – as a high school student in Montreal, and then as a teacher of high school students in Vancouver.

When I wasthirty years old. When I was a man, not a boy. When I was supposed to know better.

In the video that came out, everyone focussed on the blackface-style racism, and they should have. But they missed something, maybe because the video was grainy.

In it, I’m wearing a T-shirt with bananas on the front. I’ve stuffed something down the front of my jeans. And I jump around like an ape.

I did all of that to communicate something that I’m amazed so many of you missed. I did it to suggest that blacks are apes. Which was the worst kind of racism.

Oh, in case you are wondering if I did blackface more than those three times, the answer is yes: I did. I repeatedly, and gleefully, acted like a racist. I can’t remember every detail because I was wasted.

The people who work for me have all forgiven me, of course. What do you expect? When the boss asks people for forgiveness, they will always give it.

But I must say that Liberal MPs of colour – Navdeep Bains, Omar Alghabra, Greg Fergus – surprised even me with how speedily they pronounced me without sin. I think we all know that if Andrew Scheer had done blackface on Halloween at the age of five, Navdeep, Omar and Greg would be convening a Human Rights Tribunal right now to have Scheer thrown in a gulag in Nunavut for the rest his life.

Because black face is racist. What I did was racist. I wanted to communicate that black people are worthy of mockery. That they are apes. That they belong in cages. That’s as racist as it gets.

Now, last week, I tried to excuse away my racism by saying I was a child of privilege. That I had grown up with a “blind spot” about such things. But we all know that’s a lie.

Growing up rich, and going to the best schools – being a child of privilege – doesn’t excuse my racism. In fact, it’s the reverse: it makes my racism all the more wrong. I, growing up in the house of the man who gave Canada a Charter of Rights, should have known better.

Anyway, words are cheap. I apologize for stuff all the time, to the point where the apologies have no meaning anymore. All that matters is actions, not words.

So, I will now do what I should’ve done last week. I intend to resign the office of the Prime Minister soon after the election, win or lose. And, by the way, I’m amazed I could still win it. That says a lot more about Canadians that it does about me, frankly.

So, there you go. I need time to get away and learn to be a better Dad, a better husband, a better man. I can’t do that as Prime Minister of Canada.

Because words can’t excuse what I did.

Because what I did was racist.

What Trudope did in the photos and videos was a lot of things: stupid, immature, ill-informed, intolerant, blinkered, privileged, shallow, showboating, grand-standing, ego-driven…. the list goes on and on. But ultimately, it wasn’t racist.

Here’s the thing: he’s demonstrated these behaviors, in whole or in part, throughout his entire term. Showy virtue-signaling in place of real action, empty promises made with no intention of keeping them, and a real lack of understanding of any of the files he mishandles.

That a man who lacked for nothing growing up as the son of a Prime Minister and the grandson of a successful businessman could grow up to be such an empty vessel is astonishing. So many people who grow up from a place of privilege go on to live a life of service, to repay in part for the bounty of riches they got to take advantage of.

Not our boy Justin. An empty vessel with no discernible skills but a tendency to be theatrical… a skill well-suited to pulling the wool over the collective eyes of a disengaged electorate to become PM.

Now that we know the truth… that there’s no “there”, there, now that we know he’s an attention-seeking lightweight who doesn’t know the meaning of contrition, responsibility or even “I’m sorry”, let’s do us all a favor. Deny him a second term.

An action doesn’t have to be conscious to count as racist. Whether he intended it maliciously or not, he did demonstrate that he thought it was funny to portray a racist stereotype. I mean, he shoved something down his pants! You can’t tell me that doesn’t count as racist.

It’s not as bad as lynching or burning crosses on somebody’s lawn… but let’s not pretend it wasn’t racist at all.

Justin was almost thirty years old at the last one (that we know of). This spoiled boy child hasn’t grown up. He’s still dressing up (India trip).

No, it’s just sharing responsibility for bad behavior with others so he gets less blame and consequences: it’s that simple.

By his telling, it was those who gave him a high-quality progressive liberal education were to blame for him not knowing better, and also those who treated him well growing up. His “privilege” made him do this bad thing over and over again.

Guess what? A lot of people went to those schools: they didn’t do this. For example, the Arabian Nights event was a black tie party. It wasn’t a dress up party. He’s the only guest who arrived in costume, much less blackface.

No, this is Justin’s behavior, not merely his “privilege.” Most rich people are not total pricks in this way. Why would they be?

Yeah, I’m not saying they’re perfect, but they don’t prance around in racist costumes over and over again throughout their lifetimes.

Just watched Trudeau refuse to answer a question asking what “costume” he was wearing in the river rafting video. He prattled on with his usual non answer bafflegab and when challenged again by the reporter to answer the question he again refused and repeated the same nonsense. I think the following may be the underlying problem :
A pathological liar tells lies and stories that fall somewhere between conscious lying and delusion. They sometimes believe their own lies.
It’s difficult to know how to deal with a pathological liar who may not always be conscious of their lying. Some do it so often that experts believe they may not know the difference between fact and fiction after some time.
Pathological liars also tend to be natural performers. They’re eloquent and know how to engage with others when speaking. They’re creative and original, and quick thinkers who don’t usually show common signs of lying, such as long pauses or avoidance of eye contact.
When asked questions, they may speak a lot without ever being specific or answering the question.
Sure sounds like the Trudeau we have seen over the last 4 years in the HOC and the numerous scandals…

Justin Trudeau didn’t dress in blackface, wear a banana shirt, shove a massive fake dick down his pants, and act like an ape and/or savage because he didn’t know better: he knew it was offensive and did it to show he could get away with it. He has no shame and is a sociopath.

Not all sociopaths are bad people. Some make excellent surgeons or generals, to name two, where ruthless decisions have to be made for the greater good. For Justin Trudeau, he and he alone is the greater good. To Hell with his Party or his country! He didn’t even tell his LPC handlers about all this. It was bound to come out and it did.

I think for a lot of people who see themselves as progressive, virtue is not a matter of personal behaviour or integrity, it’s grounded in their political and social opinions. I’ve never thought my conservative leanings put me in the company of people who were generally more ethical or even nicer than those across the aisle, but that feeling seems to be very common on the port side. If a Con had been caught in blackface, it would be seen as revealing his or her hidden deep desire to reestablish slavery, but when it’s one of their own, it’s embarrassing, but really not all that serious because the “real” JT is revealed in his odes to feminism, Pride Day marches, etc. How anyone can take the apology our apologist-in-chief made seriously boggles my mind, but it seems it’s more than sufficient for lots of people to murmur “Ego te absolvo”.

Exactly. It’s why so many Democrats fell over themselves defending Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal and other accusations of sexual misconduct: Clinton supported all the right causes, so he was a “feminist” even if he did occasionally assault someone.

These are far and away the strongest points the CPC has, so I’m sure they’ll want to get to them – but at a time when they feel they’ll have the most impact. That’ll probably be much closer to the actual voting day.

At one point in 2015 they were actually on track to win; but they peaked too early. I’m sure they’ll want to avoid that this time – and also avoid peaking too late.

There is all the evidence in the world that Trudeau is racist.

Since being MP, he said:1. Québecers better than Albertans
2. Italian/Greek immigrants are same as ISIS
3. Engages in Cultural appropriation (India trip).
4. Chiefs don’t know, but Indigenous kids need canoes
5. Mixes us Japan PM with China because they all look alike.

This is all on top of wearing blackface multiple times.

Not only does he make racist statements, he uses minorities as props with no intention of respecting their opinions.

Sadly, similar example can be found of Trudeau misogynistic behaviour was well.

What we know is true, there was indeed a flurry of female liberal MP’s taking to social media and standing in front of TV cameras extolling the virtues of “virtue signalling” Justin Trudeau. What I want to know (and many others) is who are the three liberal male MP’s who were bullying and intimidating her, and was it at the direction of Trudeau and the PMO? I’m sure we already know that answer, but give us the names, or is Ms. Nasi still afraid of said MP’s and the PMO’s long reach? Look like a long pattern of female abuse from the feminist PM Trudeau.

As a Globe subscriber, I saw this and felt it was important enough to share with you in its entirety, which is not something I do often. Please read it. W]


The photographs reveal the contours of a mask. By now, millions of people have seen the image: a man wearing dark brown makeup and a turban on his head, grinning into the camera. A spirit of conviviality and blissful unawareness reigns. Other people are present, but no one else has blackened their skin.

The man in question, of course, is Justin Trudeau, 29-years-old at the time and living one of the most privileged lives in the entire land. The pictures are horrifying, and each one unmasks the man with the darkened skin.

A brown friend sent me the photo. “This is how you lose an election,” he said. I saw the picture and my throat constricted. Anger, shame and hurt pulsed in my temples. I had supported Mr. Trudeau, admired his tenacity and goodwill, and worked for his government. His father was the reason my father was even allowed here. And yet, there he was, native son of wealth and privilege, having sung all the right tunes about diversity to get elected, caught engaging in one of the most humiliating forms of racist mockery. It felt like a personal betrayal.

I thought back to the children in the school playground who used to shout “Paki” at me. I thought of the scraps and fights and bruises and broken teeth. I thought of the kids in my university who dressed up in insulting costumes and drunkenly revelled in appropriating other people’s cultures for the night.

Even as an adult, I carry this shame around with me, do what I must to hide it, run from it, dissemble it. I thought of all the brown and black kids who must be wondering or suppressing the questions of why our leader did what he did. The flip-side of brownface and blackface are the actual brown and black faces ashamed of who they are.

These photos and video are not to be taken lightly. They are extreme manifestations of racist derision. Brownface and blackface arise out of minstrelsy and colonialism, taking the ancient form of domination by humiliating people the white man has conquered, wearing their distorted faces as masks for one’s amusement.

Wearing brownface is an intentional act, satiating the white man’s fetish for appropriating the colour and the attire of the dispossessed, to serve his own fantasies. British culture, wrote the historian Nupur Chaudhuri, had a “long heritage of negative sentiments toward dark-skinned persons. The ultimate negative symbol is the devil – black, hairy, horned, and hoofed.” An ugly history bellowed out of Mr. Trudeau’s gaze.

The question is not whether Mr. Trudeau was filled with racist hatred, and the response to this cannot be, “But Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is worse.” The Liberal Leader wore blackface. Let’s start there. He said on Tuesday that he has not worn it since 2001, but that doesn’t change the fact that he was an adult who mocked people of colour for sport. He was innocent in a way that would be touching if it were not so repulsive. He is innocent, just like the country that seems to be shrugging this off. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime, a punishing innocence that cannot be easily forgiven.

Ever since Mr. Trudeau entered national politics, the actor-turned-leader had worn a mask that had been fitted so well for so long that part of him must have assumed its form. What lay underneath was the distempered face, the real face, the one that had been concealed.

He came from a rarefied social class that existed independently of real people’s lives, growing up in the prime minister’s official residence, surrounded by foreign dignitaries. He would have met heads of state from Africa and South Asia. It strains credulity to believe that he did not know exactly what he was doing when he blackened his skin.

Racism among the elite is hidden behind correctly phrased sentences and polite nods to fashionable ideas. People who have had the best of everything their whole lives also need you to know they have the best opinions.

This Canadian variant of racism is more insidious than the American: Protected by politeness, racism can be perpetuated under a shield of good intentions. This is also textbook neo-colonialism: The white man will govern us for our benefit, and anyone who opposes him will be slandered, or worse. Look at the plight of Indigenous peoples. Look at the racial makeup of who is incarcerated, detained, deported.

In Mr. Trudeau’s rise to power, there were other signs of a mind corrupted by privilege. The paid speeches he gave while an MP, despite his six-figure salary and trust fund. He told an American magazine that he wanted to box a “scrappy tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community.” The mistreatment of the former attorney-general. The costumes in India. What was evident was not just blindness, but a deliberate unwillingness to see, one that has caused our country great harm.

This brownface episode has made many people suddenly wake up to the reality that Canada may be racist. White Canadians may feel uncomfortable by all this, but minorities in this country have been dealing with discomfort since they looked in the mirror as children.

I am a prisoner of my own experience here. It had been my dream to work for Mr. Trudeau’s government on foreign policy. I had worked hard and earned the right to serve my country. I headed to Ottawa feeling optimistic and hopeful. But as soon as I got there, I felt that something was fundamentally wrong.

Everyone with real power was white and looked the same – unacceptable for a movement pledging racial diversity as a core principle. Condescending attitudes were regularly revealed. Minorities were undermined, ghettoized. The casual disregard of the privileged was systemic. I felt like I could not breathe.

After several months, I decided to leave of my own free will. It is still one of the hardest decisions I have made, and felt more like jumping off a building. The hurt ran deep. Friendships were broken. I felt that I had failed and my reality had been distorted beyond my recognition.

Weeks passed, my mental health worsened. I became isolated. When I worked up the courage to make some tepid critiques of the India trip online, a senior person from the Prime Minister’s Office wrote to me. Perhaps they finally wanted to listen?

No. I was told that no one trusted me there from the beginning, that I was in it for my own reasons and that I was self-regarding in my criticism. I was stunned. For months afterward, I blamed myself. I thought perhaps they were right – that I was another uppity brown person who was too impatient.

I questioned my own reality, and once again the internalized racism ravaged my mind. After all of that, to discover that Mr. Trudeau had a fondness for wearing my skin on his face. I had been played. All of us had.

We often speak of racism as though it is a purely emotional phenomenon, but racism manifests itself in the body, and the body responds to it like a virus. Cortisol levels spike, increasing the chance of almost every conceivable illness. An enormous amount of mental energy is expended trying to understand other people’s slights and to keep oneself under mental surveillance.

Your sense of reality becomes permanently distorted. You question your own dignity and worth. The sociology, the history, the economics, the privilege, the power, the whiteness: None capture how racism dislodges the body, cracks bones, shatters identities, turns the minority into an alien in his own skin. And for people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and work their way to the elite – always having to be twice as good – their cells visibly age faster because of the stress response in dealing with discrimination. They have the longest distance to fall.

Racism is not a play thing or a wedge issue to be weaponized. It is the tragic story of our lives.

Canada, like the United States, remains a divided country. Official statistics do not reveal this, but segregation exists first in the mind, especially of those who have been blind their whole lives. Whiteness is a shelter from the realities of the world, realities Mr. Trudeau and his kind never faced until now because the joke was always on somebody else.

Apologies are not enough; they are a beginning, not an end. What we need now is a national reckoning of the sort we have never had. People must be held accountable in all parties. Painful grievances must be aired, uncomfortable truths spoken.

No one is free from their history, and silence is another form of lying. We must force ourselves to see the “Other” in our midst, truly see them. Our country has lied to itself enough already. Real change will happen only when Mr. Trudeau and his class have the courage to open their eyes and take a good look at what they’ve been missing. Until that day comes, we will remain in an infantile and morally duplicitous state of innocence","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Sometimes I wonder about my fellow citizens in Ontario. The National Post reports that half of voters won’t vote for Scheer because of Doug Ford trying to handle Wynne’s massive deficits. But will vote for a man who has gotten rid of two female cabinet ministers, has forced out two female MPs, groped a woman in B.C., broken the law twice, and likes to dress up in blackface. Funny old world isn’t it.

What he said was disappointing, although the Conservatives would never be blamed for failure of inclusiveness, becuase everyone knows they wouldn’t try.

I happen to live in a Liberal-NDP swing riding. If there is a minority the Liberal could very well end up supporting a the Conservatives like they did so often last time, so a vote of the Liberals is a vote for Scheer.

Does one need to exaggerate $350 billion in debt? Sounds pretty bad on its own. What has he cut exactly, we just set a record for spending under Ford. Would love to know.

I did hear a rumour the first thing Scheer was going to cut once in office was the makeup and costume department. Those are probably pretty vulnerable people. Eggs and omelettes I guess.

Extremely powerful. As a Canadian who has lived abroad as a visible minority, and as the father of a mixed race child I have witnessed and felt the effects of racism firsthand in a way I never could as a white boy growing up in Canada. The experiences changed me. I don’t think I can ever remember reading anything that lets a reader understand what the effects of racism do to an individual in the way this piece does. Thank you for posting this.

Canada has a lot of racism, but discrimination in general – racism being one kind of discrimination. Anybody from an immigrant family knows that in Canada you confront ignorance more often than not – we aren’t as progressive as we shop ourselves – going through a school system staffed by old stock, as a person from an immigrant family, you realize how isolated and clueless they really are –

What I find obnoxious is that people think in terms of elitism – that the image is sought after – because i have met a lot of people who consider themselves elites, and i never see it. I’ve met senior executives, or “local” elites with a family name – i never experience the rational because in their presence it’s always a big let down. They feel smaller and isolated. Maybe being from an immigrant family exposes you to more so it’s hard to take them seriously –

Mr. Aziz’s experience may be completely accurate, especially considering the crowd he was dealing with, but we only have his word for it at this point. However, I have a lot of trouble with his shift into his general critique of Canadian society. There are a lot of individual objections that can be made. In seventy years I’ve never worn or come across anyone in blackface and I wouldn’t have been amused if I had, so what white “fetish” is he talking about? Piggybacking on the plight and history of indigenous peoples whose story bears no resemblance to that of first and second generation non-white Canadians strikes me as a huge conceit. And if I’m existentially stained by hundreds of years of white history, why is he not similarly tainted by his?

We now have a multi-racial society and change has to come to make sure everyone feels included and respected. So let’s talk about those changes. But if the dialogue consist of me sitting quietly and listening to long lectures on how the looks on my face betray a racist essence and how “I” bear individual responsibility for the whole history of empire and colonialism, and how I represent some kind of exclusive culture that oppresses and patronizes people who don’t look like me, I’m not buying it and my participation will not be sincere. That’s not what I see when I go out in my community and I’m fairly sure it’s not how I speak or act. More to the point, that is not the way to promote inter-ethnic respect and equality in the public square. It might, however, be the way to drive people into the arms of types like Bernier and other extremists, a point made eloquently by the ever-insightful Andrew Sullivan in the past couple of weeks.

Sorry I beg to differ and I struggle to the realization our society needs a fix. Not trying to shift Trudeau’s failures to society he’s tried that himself.
The issue is 1/3 of our society if you believe the polls will vote liberal despite this most offensive failure.
That number is likely higher. I’m sure that some conservative/ppc/bloq supporters are more offended that Trudeau may be receiving benefit of a double standard and are as outraged at that as his actions.
So privileged white male here has come to a grave conclusion WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SOCIETAL FAILURES ALLOWING THIS TO GO UNPUNISHED

Bingo. Omer’s transition from Trudeau’s multiple racist acts to pinning it on all Canadians is simply wrong. It was clear as day what he was seeking to do. If he wanted to write about racist Canada he ought not conflate it with our disgraceful PM’s conduct. I also wonder about his naivete when heading off to Ottawa. I am never surprised by how low the Liberal party can go, while he seemed genuinely surprised that they routinely put everyone into little voting bins based on race, gender, income and national origin. Sadly, that is the modern Liberal party. His naivete may also have led him to believe that as an employed member of the Liberal team, he was equal to longstanding members. In reality, no business works that way, here or anywhere else. His experience clearly demonstrated that a small group of back-room, corporate and elitist white guys from Montreal run not only the party but the puppet at the helm. This, too, is something I have long known. On the bright side, Omer, you learned a lot and, more importantly, you escaped from the Liberal deathtrap mindset. I wish you success with your next position.

Wow! Grew up in small town Ontario in the 1970s. If not for television I am not sure I would have even known of any other races. That ignorance aside my upbringing was to treat all equally. I’m not perfect but I’m beginning to see the reality that my nation is not the place of refuge for some that I’ve been programmed to believe. I used to think I didn’t owe the world an apology for simply being a white male. Now I am sorry for not calling out others actions and for being careless in any with my own words and deeds. I don’t know what to think anymore because I still hope most white males are not treating others like this out of habit. None that are should have a place on a ballot.

Wow – a very strong piece! It should make everyone take a closer look at oneself.

Liberals are blinded by self-serving, self important superiority. They fail to see the Emperor has no clothes, (except when he’s in full Indian costume) and are willing to vote for a self-centred hypocrite, who has made his way through life on his name and privilege. The LPC appointed him leader, not for his brains (hate to state the obvious) but for Brand appeal. I’m wondering what’s been said behind closed doors at LPC HQ? Where are the voices of the gutless liberal MP’s who stand behind this sanctimonious fraud – why are they not calling him out for what he is, he’s an imposter and shallow excuse of a man. He calls himself a feminist and a defender of racial diversity – we now know he is neither.

I applaud Omer Aziz, and only hope others follow his lead. Again we see the PMO intimidating both when Omer was working in the PMO, and after he left of his own accord. I expect Trudeau and the PMO are following instructions in the how to run government hand book, Chinese style. Gerry Butts, the puppeteer, king maker and PMO bully is behind most or perhaps all of Trudeau’s rise to the top, must have known of Trudeau’s penchant for blackface and the groping episode. He has a lot to answer to.

I wish Omer Aziz well, perhaps a stint in the CPC war room may help exorcize his bad experience with Trudeau and the liberals.

Feminist Trudeau was asked by a reporter today about the female MP who was forced out. He stated that she was not removed for the reasons she gave. So in other words, she is either lying or she experienced it differently. And reporters finally chastised him for not actually answering questions given to him.

All I can say after reading this– and I’ll have to take the time to read it again– is that recently (even before the blackface revelations) it’s occurred to me that though I live in T.O. I live a remarkably segregated life. Since graduating from UW 20 years ago my social life and work life have gotten very much LESS diverse over the years. This is in “the most multicultural city in the world” (gag). I’m flummoxed as to what to think further about it, other than noting it’s happened. And yes I know dining in Little India or Chinatown does not count. Just something to further think about while I live my little middle-class life I guess….

The Laurentian elites in Canada control access to the industries of influence…i.e. the media, publishing, PR, political infrastructure, banking and finance, etc…through unpaid internships, which is why Toronto is white on top and brown on the middle and bottom. A few outsiders are allowed in to give a patina of diversity.

Unpaid internships have proven far more successful with less complaints than Bill 21 in Quebec.

Gatekeeping by unpaid internships has to be outlawed

If this clown gets elected again, which I think is more than likely going to happen as I have ZERO faith in the general electorate – what does that say to the rest of the world about Canada, whose status on the world stage would be, to put it lightly, embarrassing.

And riddle me this, should he get in with a minority propped up by dippers & greens (also a likely scenario), which for all practical reasons would mean the end of the Canadian oil industry – what possible reason does Alberta, and to a lesser extent, Saskatchewan, have to remain in confederation?

Bingo. I’ve always felt Canada as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts but now I’m ready to see Alberta leave. Just go already and lets have some TRULY hardnose negotiations. GTFO. Let you sell your tar exclusively through the US. Bon chance. Or if we come to an agreement where some of it can be sold through the Remaining Canada, you’ll get less for it and we’ll genuinely tax the shit out of it as a foreign transport and use that $$ for good. Alberta overestimate its contribution to our country period. Be gone and let’s compete against each other as true foreigners.

Here in Alberta there is a pulpible, seething anger that Trudeau would change one law and break another to save jobs in Quebec, but barely lift a finger for anyone in Alberta (buying an un-built pipeline expansion doesn’t count.) If he cancels TMX the Alberta-BC border is going to be shut down by mobs of unemployed energy workers (200,000 of us) and their immediate families (another 300,000). Trudeau will have to decide if he wants to unleash a national unity crisis to save his own skin.

With respect, prognostication on hypotheticals is pie-in-the-sky. Wait for the damned decision and then take it from there. Alberta will then do what it has to do. Period. And so will we eventually in Quebec. One day we will be out too. I’m 50% + 1 for Alberta, or any other jurisdiction, not just Quebec.

Mr. Aziz loses all credibility with the following statement: “This brownface episode has made many people suddenly wake up to the reality that Canada may be racist. ”
It’s not Canada – it’s Trudeau, and those who support him. The majority of Canadians have never wore blackface, have never groped a woman, and dressed in Bollywood clothes, and never said that indigenous chief don’t know what they are doing because youth want canoe sheds.
Canadians are a good people – likely the best on earth. I am tired of being tarred the same as a person I have nothing in common with, and never have, or never would, support.

The gullibility of Canadian voters never ceases to amaze me. Whether you agree with the other parties climate change policies or not, at least they are outlined and costed. Trudeau states he has no policies yet, and no costing, but he will think about it after the election. Trust us. And of course no mention of how much he will raise the carbon taxes. Meanwhile the National Post reports that is Environment Minister blocked messages from the Climate Strike people because they said negative things about Trudeau’s policies.

How do you know that, Ronald? Why is it self-evident? And if it’s true, is it just true for whites or is it a universal phenomenon? And if it’s a universal phenomenon, should our politics take on the task of curing us of such thoughts? Should we be policing one another about what is going on in our heads? It seems to me the only political systems that do that are theocracies and totalitarian regimes. Neither is very pleasant to live under.

Keep up the great work, Mr. Kinsella. Hopefully your next column about Trudeau’s racist nickname for Jagmeet Singh will(that you alluded to in your column today) emerges before JT has a chance to march in Montreal tomorrow. That’d be a glorious way to “rain on his parade”, so to speak. Additionally, any of the “more to come” juicy Trudeau scandals/dirt that you’ve alluded to recently (including with Adrian Batra on “Batra’s Battleground” and also on Evan Solomon’s radio show where he agreed “more is coming this week”) can hurry up and arrive anytime now. You’ve alluded to Bob Fife and “why did Trudeau leave West Point Grey Academy?” ). Canadians are eagerly awaiting all of that, increasingly. Thanks again. Best regards.

But my vote is entirely selfish, self-centered and with blinders on : I want Trudeau out and I’ll vote for quite literally anyone who can accomplish that.

190,Warren Kinsella,Trump and Trudeau: brothers of another mother,2019-09-27 06:44:00,Warren,,"Trump and Trudeau: They’re not that different, really.

Sons of millionaires. Never had to worry about a hydro bill, never needed to fret about a mortgage payment. Never experienced the pocketbook terror that is everyday existence for lesser mortals.

Bodyguards, maids, chauffeurs, private jets: These were the emblems of the lives that Trudeau and Trump led and lead. They breathed the same rarefied air as other millionaires and billionaires. They got invited to all the right parties. We in the media hung on their every utterance, stupidly believing that being born rich renders someone worth listening to.

No military service for either. No involvement in government before they both somehow seized the top job. No known ideas or policies. But models, yes. Lots.

And famous. Trump became famous for The Apprentice, and for his expert manipulation of New York City’s viciously competitive media. He’s the assignment editor for all journalists, and he bragged about it in his various ghosted books. Said he in The Art of the Deal: “Most reporters, I find, have very little interest in exploring the substance of a detailed proposal for a development. They look instead for the sensational angle.”

Trudeau gets that, too. He became famous because of the sensational eulogy he gave to his father — the one that his pal, Gerald Butts, told everyone that he wrote — and he became even more famous when he sensationally beat up an indigenous man.

He actually bragged about that. Trudeau actually crowed that he consciously targeted an indigenous man for a public beating. Said Trudeau to Rolling Stone: “I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.”

So: Rich, privileged, famous. There’s a reason why Trump and Trudeau have mostly gotten along so well: They both are charter members of the lucky sperm club.

But there is one characteristic that they share above all others. There is one thing, in government and out, that makes them brothers of another mother.

They believe the rules don’t apply to them.

This week, Trump reminded us of that. This week, we learned that he really, truly had called the newly minted president of Ukraine, and requested, seven times, that Ukraine investigate a U.S. citizen, one Joe Biden. Conservatives may not regard that as a “high crime,” but it sure as hell is at least a “misdemeanour” — and, therefore, an impeachable offence.

And how did we get the evidence that Democrats are now relying upon to impeach Trump? Well, they got it from Trump himself. He provided his political executioners with the rope they needed to fashion a noose.

Because he doesn’t think the law should apply to him.

Ditto Trudeau. He can brag about beating up someone who is indigenous (Patrick Brazeau), he can try and destroy an indigenous woman who refused to break the law for him (Jody Wilson-Raybould), he can wear racist blackface to mock others (black Canadians) — and then brazenly claim he isn’t racist.

(Oh, and he and his cabal can come up with a racist name for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, too. More on that in my next column.)

Trudeau can do all those racist things, and then insist he believes in tolerance and diversity. Which is standard operating procedure for someone who believes the rules don’t apply to him.

Only one thing differentiates the two leaders right now: Donald Trump is facing impeachment for his sins, and Justin Trudeau isn’t.

Though there are some big differences between them. Trump can hardly be said to have coasted through his youth doing non-jobs supported by his trust fund. Trump has always been an outlier among the beautiful people (I don’t think he was invited to the right parties). Trump revels in insulting people and never apologizes for it while JT pretends to love everybody and has made apologizing a second career. The people who back them whatever they do appear to generally be very different types.

As we are discussing “silent” racism these days, I was never comfortable with the treatment the media and elites meted out to Brazeau. The man was accused of some serious stuff to be sure, but he was completely ostracized by all of Ottawa and left nearly in penury. He had accomplished quite a lot for someone despite a tough background. I felt it was in part because he didn’t fit the mold of what a certain kind of contemporary right-thinking person thinks an aboriginal person should stand for and speak like.

“The reality is God gave us some oil and someone to buy it, but we should use the profit of that to make Canada even greener. Let’s be practical.” – Jean Chretien

What can’t Trudeau say that? It’s brillant

Also, if Jean Chretien is campaigning for Trudeau then Warren, shouldn’t you be as well? Loyalty has its limited I suppose.

Former prime ministers have strong opinions of the incumbent. But no matter what they all think, Liberal ones have no choice but to campaign for this guy. To do otherwise is not even remotely possible for les anciens. They are thoroughly boxed in right out of the gate.

Just saw a staged photo op of the Boy Wonder, paddling up to an awaiting podium. He announced a $2000 tax credit for the poor folk to facilitate their going camping. Doesn’t quite cover all the costs of flying across the country to go surfing in Tofino with da wife and kids in tow, but hey, its a start. Right?

By the way, Stockwell Day once did the same thing but came ashore in a jet ski and he was crucified for it. The Fake One will no doubt get a free pass.

Who ever came up with that crazy idea? I’d like a job on their team if all I would have to do is spew out cool ideas about how we should use tax credits to help people live like my Dear Leader. Personally I would have suggested using the $2k to help poor people buy organic vegetables and free-range chickens.

Very true and main thing is both are narcissists who think they are smarter than everyone else. Also both have cult like followers that will excuse bad behaviour from them they wouldn’t from anyone else. However unlike Trump, we have a chance to fire Trudeau in 24 days. I am voting to have him fired, unfortunately I fear enough Canadians will put him back in.

After getting a great photo op with Greta for his election ads, Justin announced that not only will he send the nation’s kids canoeing, but he will plant 2 billion trees.

Even though we have a huge deficit and debt, I’m sure international lenders will lend him more money.

The only difference between the two is that Trump knows he is all that you say and more, while Trudeau is all that you say and pretends that he is not. Trump makes no apologies; that is all Trudeau does and he can’t even manage to be genuine about that. Trump is a genuine asshole and embraces it; Trudeau is a genuine asshole and won’t admit it.

Warren,

You point out that with the Trudeau spectacle that Scheer should be way ahead. However, that conclusion only applies to truly moderate candidates. Scheer is more Conservative than yours truly, so people are hesitant. They wonder if they should take a big leap of faith, like they did in 2015. If they are satisfied with Trudeau but still technically undecided, then vote for him. But if you’re undecided but royally sick of Trudeau, then vote him out. How I wish we could do this with Jagmeet Singh but unfortunately, that won’t happen. That leaves only one game in town to turf Trudeau: they’re called the CPC.

All people change in life, hopefully for the better. I can understand why Trudeau was embarrassed and said nothing as a Liberal candidate and then as MP for Papineau.

But when you aspire to lead your party– and ultimately the nation — you have a special duty to be straight with those you hope to represent. Trudeau failed in that duty.

Do I think Trudeau in 2019 is racist? No. But he has miserably failed the obligations test he owed to all Canadians. He’s the leader of our country. He should have come forward as soon as he became leader, apologized and immediately worked to heal wounds and divisions, along with making amends. He quite deliberately didn’t do that. That’s precisely why this election is now a referendum on Justin Trudeau. It’s up to each of you to render your own judgment.

Whether Justin is or isn’t a racist can be answered by every voter. But Justin is:– unethical

– a virtue signalling hypocrite
– and someone who fails to keep his promises.

Now is the time for Canadians to say “Team Trudeau, you’re not good enough”.

I don’t think he deserves a free pass on racism. At all.

Outwardly he may make a big show of supporting all sorts of supposedly anti-racist policies; but his personal conduct matters. And even without his deranged fixation on blackface, the examples above are telling: he doesn’t have to be burning crosses on a lawn for his behaviour to count as racist.

It’s like Bill Clinton and other politicians (including Trudeau!) supporting certain policies, while also assaulting women in private: supporting the former doesn’t excuse the latter.

Most people know that the Toronto Star has always been a Liberal Party rag. But they are working overtime to spin our little Justin. They blocked the video of Trudeau’s white water rafting scandal(emphasis on white), and finally released it seven hours later after it was seen on the Post Millennial website. And in their Sunday edition the Star tries to put a positive note on his little racist adventure. It wasn’t a banana on his shirt so everything is ok. Just ignore the blackface part. Must be that evil Doug Ford stirring things up again. And today after doing basically nothing for four years, they are going to pour money into the violence problem in Toronto. Nothing to do with the election of course. Apparently according to the Liberals, nothing can get done until election time.

I said to my wife after Trudeau’s announcement today re his promise to keep on spending – “the fools who are voting for him, will be the ones who will have to pay for the reckless spending Spree” ! And a new luxury tax is just the start. Wait til he comes after your untaxed RRSP. Just like how the liberals plundered the EI surplus (or IE as it was then) and cut health transfers to the Province’s. Nickel and Dime you with a Netflix tax and on it goes. Liberal answer to this is plant another money tree – that would be you BTW! Someone always has to pay in the end.

Trudeau is a phoney, Period. Ask yourself this, if you’re considering voting for him. If it was Elizabeth May or Andrew Scheer prancing around in blackface with a fake penis down his pants, lied, was found guilty of ethics violations, trying to subvert the course of justice, including denying the RCMP access, broke the biggest promise in the last election, bullied women and groped a young journalist. Would you condone this behavior and say it was OK? If you do think this is OK then you have no morals and what is next for Trudeau? What would it take to shock you and turn you away from this man without a moral compass.

If there was any sort of palace revolt at the news I would disagree, but there simply are no courageous Liberal candidates who have stepped forward to say they are deeply offended by the leader’s past actions. That speaks to more than one man, there is some degree of systemic racism or at the very least a vacuum of qualities within the party to do anything but ride on his coattails.

I am a non-committed conservative (meaning I do not have a valid membership) but I am a former Liberal card carrying member. I left a lot earlier than the current crop of discontent. I voted once for Jean Chrétien than unlike Warren, I became offended by his party’s arrogance and the party’s sense of entitlement after one term where they nearly divided the country at the Ontario Quebec border.

I’m not saying anything other than the Liberal brand of today is nowhere near that which my father and grandfather bled. That is sad

I would go so far as to say that the Liberal ideology is healthy, but it is as distant from today’s Liberals as Max Bernier is from being a dipper.

NOTHING has changed when a bankrupt braintrust can ride on the coat tails of a feeble minded racist – my local candidate as and ALL local liberal candidates don’t deserve to be seated in the next parliament but the electorate seems fooled.

Liberals should be trailing the PPC and anyone who says that the leader of any other party would not have been canned is simply not honest with themselves. The Ontario PCs did it to a candidate with far less evidence of stain and whether you hate or loathe Doug Ford, you have to admire that he was able to lead a party to victory from a point of deep shame.

On second thought, is it possible that the police thought Menzies was a threat to himself after he was hit by the Scheer campaign bus and arrested him for mental health concerns, i.e., under the Mental Health Act?

(I am not saying David Menzies is actually mentally ill or was in emotional crisis. However, maybe after being kicked out and immediately being hit by the bus outside the police were concerned. Just a thought.)

Raj is one of the moderators in the crucial (and only) English-language leaders’ debate.

She and her employer have been criticized many times in the past for being biased – in favour of the Liberal Party of Justin Trudeau.

In my view, Butts was merely doing his job, and doing it well. But was it a good idea for Raj to get together with Butts, mere days before the debates kick off?

No. And some studies actually make that clear, too.
Conservative voters – and the debate audience will include conservative voters – are acutely focussed on moderator bias,as seen in this Rasmussen survey. Why, then, feed that narrative?
The danger for Raj, here, is that she can (and likely will) be now seen as having changed the debate outcome – whether she did so or not. Moderators may feel they lack that power, but voters don’t think they do.
There is now an entire cottage industry devoted to finding and documenting media bias. It is a surprisingly sophisticated mini-industry. Raj is dreaming in technicolour (or in high definition 4K) if she thinks that the above little get-together will go unnoticed. It lit up the Internet after it came out last night; it’s still doing so.

There’s bias, and there’s appearance of bias. In a tight election race, it is stupid for a reporter to do anything that provides evidence of an appearance of bias. Particularly when there is arequirement that “high journalistic standards” be maintained in respect of the debates.

It’s always the same: people in Ottawa regularly think that everyone South of the Queensway don’t notice what they do after hours.

That is very stupid of her. What many con voters (and I assume some Dippers) will worry about is not just whether she is biased, but whether she thinks she isn’t.

This problem has become so bad in the States that one doesn’t need to read media articles anymore, one just needs to see what outlet they are in to know what they say. The excellent news aggregate RealClearPolitics has a daily selection of about forty opinion pieces from all around the country–the vast majority (tediously) about Trump. I used to read a lot of them faithfully, but I no longer bother. I just check the publication they’re in and assume I know what they say. Occasionally I check to see whether I’m guilty of my own bias and read some as a self-imposed fairness test. So far, I am being completely fair. The only original and interesting stuff being written down there these days comes from GOP dissidents and the solid left.

It also applies to people on Facebook. Every time I see anything about politics on Facebook I immediately look to see who posted it. Then I don’t waste my time reading it as I already know what it’s going to say by who posted it.

Firstly, this should be on the front page of major newspapers across the country tomorrow. Secondly, she should be asked to step down from the panel.

That being said, this being Gerry Butts and the LPC key strategist, my concern if I were the other parties would be this: How much did Raj share with Butts as to the gist of the questions that Trudeau would be asked to respond to? And how much influence did Buts impart on Raj as to the tone and gist of the debate questions. No question, Justin gets a “heads up” as to the coming debate. This is the very thing Andrew Coyne, as a national political/government affairs commentator expressed concern about. How much does $600,000,000 buy the Trudeau government in bailing out the major newspapers? I guess it gets you to clear your calendar for Gerry BFF Butts. Sweet.

Good news for Conservative voters, Scheer has been completely investigated by the Libs and the worst thing they could find was he may or may not have been allowed to call himself a broker. He did legally sell insurance though. What an elitist! His parents made over 100k, what a snob!

As for the pic, I wonder if he is telling her what articles to write, or what questions to ask. Oh wait I forgot, articles are Telford’s specialty so it must be about the debate.

With the Libs moving hard left, and based on the polls, the majority of Canadians want to move far left from the pragmatic ways we used to praise. I fear for the future if this is a trend and not a blip.

Althea Raj personally never struck me as being all that bright in the first place on the CBC panel. She hasn’t had the experience of either Hebert or Coyne, and so I pay her little attention. She’s Liberal leaning? Who knew? I’ve never been able to discern that she can make a logical argument of any depth.

Coyne is the bright one, and seems on the face of it to be more even-handed, until you read his actual columns in the NatPost, and then you see who pays his salary.

Can somebody tell me why we have journalists asking questions at leaders’ debates anyway? Because the numbnuts Yankees do it?

Having a few poli-sci profs from Canadian universities asking debate questions seems a better bet to me than getting these journos to primp for the cameras and expand their resumes.

Bill, to your question “Can somebody tell me why we have journalists asking questions at leaders’ debates anyway?” Where you been? Firstly, Justin donated $600,000,000.00 to their employers (quid pro quo?). And secondly, Justin flexes his muscles when it comes to which debates he participates in and under what circumstances. Apparently you admire Coyne, but you don’t read him as often as you should. (Your comment about reading hos columns and who pays his salary is as cheap a partisan shot as there is.)

In fairness, how do we know that Raj doesn’t also meet with strategists from other parties as well? Isn’t it “normal” in Ottawa for journalists and politicians (and handlers) of all stripes to interact on a social level?

That’s a fair question in most cases, but Raj’s personal bias has been long established. She’s Liberal, through and through.

According to this well known Media Bias chart (which is hardly a right wing source) it is the left wing equivalent to the Washington Times and other non-credible right wing “news” outlets.

https://www.adfontesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Media-Bias-Chart_4.0_8_28_2018-min.jpg

Looks to me like the Liberals are trying desperately to make a mountain out of a molehill.

If the worst scandal they can find about Scheer is that he sometimes conversationally refers to his brief career in the insurance industry by saying he was “an insurance broker”, when he was on the path to being licensed but left to become an MP before actually receiving the license, then they’re only making him look pretty damned squeaky clean.

They may be trying to create the impression that he went around defrauding little old ladies or something, but that clearly isn’t the case, and the “scandal” (such as it is) isn’t sticking.

There’s a reason why the CBC isn’t running with this one.

Oh, they covered it, and there were hundreds of JT fanboys shrieking stuff like ” He FAKED his resume!!” “He LIED to Canadians!!!” ” He BROKE the LAW!!!” and similar crap in the comment section, but enough of us posted the facts in response.

(he never claimed to be a ‘registered’ broker, he *was* working and acting as a broker/ salesman (is there a difference? ) and passed one of the required courses to become registered, he had left the business to run for political office *before* calling himself a broker (so he clearly wasn’t trying to illegally make a living as one), etc, etc…)

Overall, I couldn’t help but marvel at their dedication and sheer *desperation* to find something (anything!) to hammer Andrew Scheer with. As scandals go, this one is just sad.

The CBC certainly did try to make it into a scandal; but even they had to let it drop after a day or so. It was just so obvious that nobody cared. If they’d continued to push it, they’d only have been revealing their own biases all the more.

I’m sure they’ll still try to mention it whenever they can, but I don’t think it will help their cause. If anything, it may annoy people and make the CBC and Liberals look petty.

Lynda,

While I agree RB tried her best to rattle Andrew Scheer, he came over looking good IMHO. Unflappable and statesman like. If you watched the entire show (not the abridged on the news) you will see even the 5 questioners seemed to be quite happy with Andrew’s responses. And in fact, a couple of them smacked RB down.

Overall impression of Andrew Scheer’s performance was, he held is own, gave good answers intelligent answers without doublespeak, did not talk down to anyone, he looked comfortable and above all, he looked like a normal guy. Not pompous and phoney like our current PM.

Andrew Scheer will make a fine PM, one to make Canada proud again. Canada will indeed be back from the brink!

While agree that the Conservatives should be 110% in the lead, given the examples you stated. This is no fault of the Conservatives per se – this is the fault of our electorate. Us in other words. It would appear in the words of Donald Trump’s now infamous statement. Trudeau could walk down Young St and shoot someone and his supporters would still vote for him. What would it take to sour Trudeau’s support? The world is going (if not already) mad!

Many Canadians like to see themselves as worldly and intellectual, especially compared to our neighbours to the south, but this election seems to be a good illustration of how small-minded and parochial we and our political leaders can be. No major discussion about the economy, investment, technology, etc. Deficits and debt are downers, so let’s pretend they don’t matter or even exist. Nothing about foreign policy (and imprisoned Canadians), defence or American relations. No major tax initiatives or concrete social policy proposals from the two major parties. Not a word on immigration, refugees, etc. Nothing on crime and public safety. The provinces must all be happy because nobody is talking about federal-provincial relations. Hey, remember electoral reform? Pharmacare and daycare predictably are dusted off for the election and will no doubt be put back in their boxes when it’s over. Healthcare must be ideal in Canada because nobody thinks it’s worthy of mention.

Pretty much just an endless succession of unrelated tax credits and giveaways that obviously haven’t been costed, silly tax hikes that won’t raise much (rich peoples’ toys), bromides about climate change and a fixation with the leaders’ personalities and backgrounds. They are all lightweights and I’m starting to grit my teeth when I see their smiling mugs on all the posters. The Americans are proving themselves razor-sharp policy wonks compared to us.

The Cons are narrowly ahead, and they may be more than narrowly ahead in a two weeks if the trends continue.

“They should be WAY ahead!!” How exactly? Was anyone expecting a Mulroney sea change election with 50% voting Con? Me neither. Trudeau didn’t work out, but there have been Libs who made poorer cases for their election, such as Ignatieff in 2011.

All to say, I think about a 10% difference in voting intentions between Libs and Cons is about the maximum we should be expecting. Maybe that will come on election night, but for now, it is about 5%. Maybe good enough for majority , maybe not. But I suspect as of now, the cons are in the lead for seats.

It would be nice if Scheer did something other than walk around looking unoffensive and promising billions to everyone. However, based on the number of law signs I’m seeing , nobody is really interested in this election. And perhaps that is the point for the Tories. People who despise Trudeau will come out and vote. Everybody else stays home.

Apparently 32% of this country backs the Liberals regardless. Just make the election a referendum on Trudeau by virtue of doing nothing. Depress their voters.

Warren….I agree 100% with your spot on comments about Trudeau Jr., whom most of us know is the brain dead idiot son product of a former “brainy” Prime Minister (supposedly and not Fidel Castro) and his father’s ill conceived marriage to a drug using hippie party girl, also brain dead like her son.

I cannot understand WHY you still support the LPC today.

I used to vote for the Libs..Yes I got sucked in too during Trudeau-mania in ’68 like a lot of us did back then. Here was a Quebecker who said he actually was a Federalist who stood for strong Central Gov’t on behalf of all of Canada – not just for Quebec’s interests. Quebeckers were being conned again (yawn) by the separatist sentiment and ploicies during the the chain smoking Rene Leveque, Jacques Parizeau years.
But after Trudeau’s double talk during the elections, after the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo had fuel prices shooting up into space with supplies rapidly dwindling under very tight control, he conceived the Petro Canada farce for “blended made in Canada” prices. Do you remember the fights between Trudeau and Alberta’s Peter Loughheed?
Trudeau Sr. won support and we got shafted yet again at the pumps along with uncontrolled inflation and Trudeau Sr’s runaway spending……….. just like his son.
During this time, I actually made 19% the first year I cashed in a coupon from one of my Canada Savings Bonds!!!! I was one of the lucky ones to be able to lock in a mortgage for 12% back then and to be able to fit it into my Budget at the demise of course of something else in the family budget.
Lots of people lost their houses under Trudeau because they could not afford to pay the ridiculous mortgage rates in the Trudeau Sr. years.

A great number of people who remember Trudeau Sr. and the LPC’s policies at the time have commented that Trudeau Jr. is just adding to a fiscal deficit mess he created and is making worse day by day not to mention the interest on the debt to be paid and he is “leading” Canada us to the same policies of socialism and/or communism, the same footsteps that his father started!! And yet. MOST CANADIANS DO NOT WANT ANY PART OF THIS!!!!

Me?????

I started voting Conservative (except I didn’t vote for either Mulroney or Kim Campbell, his lackey, who took over the reins after Mulroney sold out Canada’s manufacturing sector et al to the Americans and Mexico). Campbell was annilated along with the PC party in the next election as you will recall. After the Conservatives and Reformers settled their differences Stephen Harper rose up the ranks to leader of the new CPC.

Stephen Harper, although he didn’t seemingly come across as an individual well, at least in some people’s opinions, was probably the best Prime Minister this Canada has had in a very long time, if not since Confederation. He was a shrewd economist during the time of the worlds’ financial crises including the States under Obama. He kept spending under control much to Liberals chagrin, during this world period of doubt and kept Canada’s Budget situation in extremely healthy condition despite the rest of the worlds’ fiscal problems.
So then so called “progressives” and some very stupid Canadians out there voted in the Elistist spoiled little rich kid sockboy, selfie crazed, me first idiot, who blows Canadas’ good name in the world and Canada’s fiscal stability, along with breaking virtually ALL of his 2015 promises in his first 4 year term!!!!!
God (all religions that believe in one and others who believe in something or someone else) help Canada and Canadians from the Liberals.

So Warren, tell me why you are still a Liberal in this day and age?

Do you really believe that the “Elitist,
rich people who are in the LPC should come first and the rest of the country can “Just eat Cake”.

Should Liberals be running Canada Federally along with all their lap dog bureaucrats in power positions within the numerous departments in the Federal Gov’t? I think NOT as all of the various Provincial Elections voting for Conservative gov’t. has shown this year. C’mon Warren….perhaps it’s time YOU gave your head a shake or two, and come on over to the “FORCE” and leave the “Dark Side” to fall apart into history on its own.

Sorry Warren, its still supposed to be a free country with free speech but I cannot understand WHY you still stand with Liberals!!

“Who are these 1/3 of Canadians who still support Trudeau?”

I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure they aren’t happy about doing so. I’ve never seen so few lawns signs as I have this time. The people who are voting Liberal are probably doing it to keep the Conservatives from winning. The Conservative voters are likely feeling just as uninspired by Scheer as I am, but will vote Conservative just to defeat Trudeau (who, let’s face it, is just becoming more and more of an embarrassment the longer he remains as leader).

I’m lucky this time that I can vote for JWR (who is poised to win) and not be forced to support someone who doesn’t deserve my vote.

I watched that spectacle yesterday, and the first impression I got, was what is wrong with that guy? He looked like a spoiled ten year old lecturing his parents. He read the same old tired script from Gerald Butts that Harper, Ford, and Scheer are evil and never answers reporter questions. His continued intrusion on provincial responsibilities is also concerning. And how does he propose to work with provinces, when his main focus is trashing provincial premiers. As far as banning military assault weapons, he might as well ban gangs from using F16 fighter jets. Because neither are used by gangs.

Like Ford or hate him, questions is, will he bring a big voter turnout? A big voter turnout could be disadvantage Trudeau! More Greens and more NDP can only hurt Trudeau – they were never going to vote Conservative anyway and will punish Trudeau for buying a Pipeline. Blue Liberals who see Trudeau as the fool he is will vote Conservative. Hardline Liberals will vote down party lines – doesn’t matter to them how unscrupulous the Trudeau Liberals have been in government. Ford still has his supporters, safe bet he’ll vote Conservative and possibly the largest turnout of Conservative in decades. Could make for an interesting night full of surprises.

Ford cannot be popular. Ontario’s finances are a mess and austerity is the only path forward. Too bad the Ford government has bungled its communications strategy. For example, it failed to use data to justify downsizing teacher headcount through attrition. There are stats showing that Ontario has lost something like 110K k-12 students since the early 2000’s while teacher headcount rose by something like 12K.

So according to the debate last night the main issues facing Canadians are gay rights, abortion, and global warming. No mention that I saw of the housing crisis, or the cost of living. Lots of talk from Groper about Harper, Ford, and Kenney. Justin reminded us that Nazis are running rampant in Canada. Bloc leader thinks that the Lavalin scandal is a nothing burger. Deficits are wonderful, Justin is wonderful.

179,Warren Kinsella,Who won and lost the French-language debate,2019-10-03 06:51:00,Warren,,"Who won? The separatist guy, Yves-Francois Blanchet. He was calm, he was cool and he was collected. He totally dominated.

Who lost? Justin Trudeau. He needed to remind everyone that that hopey-changey guy from 2015 is still around. He didn’t, because he isn’t. (And he was clobbered on one key point. More on that in a minute.)

Who won a silver? Jagmeet Singh. His French was better than expected, and he played the class-warfare card expertly.

Who barely won a French-language bronze – but seized an English-language gold? Andrew Scheer, with a caveat, which is also discussed below. Because, while he may not have won the French debate in French Canada – his equivocation on abortion was pretty bad – Scheer definitely won a French-language debate in English Canada. (I will explain.)

Anyway. Here’s my caveat about Scheer, who as I say won the debate outside Quebec, partly because no one watched it outside Quebec.

In a leaders’ debate, you need to make certain that your story that dominates. Here’s why: no matter how nice your opponent looks — no matter how articulate, no matter how charming — he or she can’t win if your message is the dominant theme of the night.

Like Andrew Scheer’s attack on Justin Trudeau’s two campaign planes. Because it (a) exposed Trudeau to be a hypocrite (b) it made him look vain (because he uses the second plane for his “canoes and costumes,” as Scheer quipped) and (c) it was the dominant theme in all the subsequent coverage in English Canada, and the Tories had graphics and ads ready to go to ensure that it dominated. It reminded me of what Jack Layton did to Michael Ignatieff in another debate, with devastating results.

Televised leaders’ debates show us all why having the dominant narrative is so crucial. TV debates give candidates a chance to stress basic campaign themes, and in front of what is usually the biggest audience of the campaign. They also let candidates depict their opponents’ campaign message in an unflattering way. But contrary to what some media pundits claim, debates are not about defining moments.

Debates are about ratifying your side’s issues — and the issues in the campaign — and looking good at the same time. They’re not about defeating the opposition’s claims, proving something, or answering reporters’ questions, either. They’re about getting your story — your spin, your message — heard by as many people as possible. Full stop.

Now, keep in mind that last night’s debate is not going to change voters’ minds about the key issues. Most of them have their minds made up by now. But in a tight race, like this one, debates can make a huge difference.

The most successful presidential and prime ministerial performers enter debates with a single clear message they wish to get across — and they use questions and interruptions to return to, or highlight, their single key message. As Dick Morris told me once, a simple way to measure success is to count the number of debate minutes devoted to your key messages (eg. for a progressive, health or the environment) and not the opposition’s (eg. for a conservative, tax cuts or “getting tough on crime”). You win when your story has taken up the greatest number of minutes. Before they head off to bed, you want the people who tuned in to conclude that your guy or gal is humble, energetic, trustworthy, passionate, positive — and that he or she is “fighting for me.”

Losing, on the other hand, is easy. If a liberal guy or gal performs well on an issue like “getting tough on crime,” and the other side doesn’t, it doesn’t matter that the liberal did a fabulous job presenting his or her case and sounded like the best debater in the history of planet Earth. The “getting tough on crime” issue is their issue. The other side will always sound more credible when the subject matter is their issue.

Anyway: facts tell, stories sell. And when you’ve got a winning story, stick to it. Don’t talk about the other guy’s story.

That smug look on Trudeau all during the debate speaks volumes for me. He looked and acted like other people’s opinions are below him. I didn’t get the impression that real concerns of Canadians were discussed. Although the NDP leader explained his usual mantra that everything should be free. The whole abortion and gay rights rants were pure politics. Those issues were settled by the courts and parliament years ago. And Trudeau’s rants about Nazis, Harper, Ford, and Kenney are getting really tiresome.

You misunderstand what his point is. Conservatives almost unanimously despise Trudeau so this plane thing is not going to move the dial much for them. People who are already fair weather supporters of Trudeau and care about environmental issues (a large part of his previous electoral coalition) may just be demotivated enough to either vote for another party or stay home. If you have been following polling the Liberals support is surprisingly resilient but it is under girded by a significant segment of flighty voters who aren’t terribly committed to the Liberals or even voting at all.

And this sustained sentiment is what gets me. The risk of Scheer as PM? Why? Because he holds the exact same position on abortion as all the other leaders? Because he will do the exact same amount for the environment as Justin Trudeau? How is Justin continuing to govern as King Canada not scarier for the future of our country than happy go lucky Andrew Scheer? The current Liberal government has been more scandalous over the last 4 years than the previous conservative government had been the previous 10. Our country is FAR more polarized than it was 4 years ago. The BQ had almost dissapeared under the conservatives but seem to be making a huge comeback under Trudeau.

“Because he will do the exact same amount for the environment as Justin Trudeau?”

No he won’t. While Trudeau may fail to meet Canada’s inadequate emission goals, there is every reason to believe Scheer will fail by a far greater margin. Based on his promises so far, emissions will go up.

There will also have to be large cuts to meet Scheer’s goal of cutting the deficit.





Vancouverois says: 

October 6, 2019 at 6:25 pm

There are going to have to be large cuts eventually; and the longer we take to get a handle on the country’s runaway debt, the bigger those cuts will be.

It’s inevitable, and those who pretend we can continue running up the national debt without consequences are being foolish. Debt that will lead to the gutting of all social programs. Politicians like Trudeau merely pretend to be supporting our social safety net, while actually undercutting it.





Darwin O'Connor says: 

October 6, 2019 at 8:50 pm

The Federal government’s debt to GDP ratio is low and will remain low under the Liberal platform. Interest rates are incredibly low.

Those terrible consequences to running up the debt the right claims will happen (and forget about when they are in power) almost never occur, especially for countries that have thier own currency.

Furgus. Using a plane is not the issue. Two planes? Really?

It’s the old “I am entitled to my entitlements” act all over again.

Let’s look at Trudeau’s actions not words (cause he lies a lot).
– He gets a vacation home at tax payer expense. Yet he insists on vacationing all over the planet at tax payer expense.
– At said vacation home Trudeau bought eight new boats/canoes, and charged them to the tax payer.
– and now two planes? Admittedly not at direct tax payer expense, but it goes to the sense of entitlement of this spoiled child, and a morally bankrupt Liberal party that won’t reign in Justin’s excesses.

Indeed, High-Carbon Hypocrite was the theme running through my mind as the day ended. But not only because Trudeau was, once again, made to look hypocritical and vain, but because of the subsequent awakening over this thing called CARBON OFFSETS. Blame can be assigned to CBC twitterers who leapt to the defence of Trudeau and in doing so got a lot of us looking at the fine print. I got to wondering what this carbon offset/credit thing really was–if it was a thing at all–and I started to dig. I read and I watched (videos). And I fell to sleep more revolted than ever, convinced that carbon offsets are the biggest scam since the church sold indulgences. So Scheer got way more than a few chuckles. He got us thinking. BTW, the best information I got was from an MIT PhD who does a great white-board explanation of who profits by the Climate Change Hoax. https://mobile.twitter.com/va_shiva/status/1176506786414825473

Sharon, the offsets are the creation of wealthy Hollywood types who want their private jets AND feel good about it. Little wonder Justy has jumped aboard. He is the way I see it. Plants differentially consume CO2 and emit O2 while photosynthesizing, however the process reverses when a plant dies. Unless that ‘captured carbon’ is preserved – say as a coffee table – it will be degraded by fungi and bacteria – which will emit CO2 as a by-product.

All of this assumes the trees are ever planted in the first place. I am sure a few of the lads in Africa and Central America have grabbed the money and run. So, Gore, DeCaprio and our own climate criminal – Justy – feel good jetting on private planes while throwing a few nickels to Africans to plant trees.

I read your words Warren, and have no doubt you are correct. I guess I am a bit of a dreamer as I have always thought debates were events where ideas were discussed, discarded or embraced. Your narrative, Warren, makes me want to take a shower and escape from this world of advertising, logos, brands and other shallow inch-deep slogans that dominate our political landscape.
I find it insulting that the best this country can come up with is a pissing match about the number of planes the PM uses. I have no use for Mr Dress Up but this story is lame. It is all gotcha journalism and the inept media laps it all up. Andrew Scheer seems like an empty suit to me, Singh is out of his depth but at least believes what he says. May? who cares…however her party could well surprise.

When do the grown ups really begin discussing the huge budget deficit? How to pay for re-arming our armed forces? Dealing with the obscene number of homeless in our big cities? Does anyone have a vision for energy development in this country for the next 20, 30 , 40 years? More windmills and solar panels ain’t gonna cut it…not in this climate. There are lots of smart people in Alberta and the market for the oilsands is going to get smaller unless they can figure out how to deal with emissions. Any ideas? I’d love to hear them, but blackface pics and old abortion stories are all that tickle my ears.
Enough. Please excuse the rant.

Well, Dawn, you are entitled to your rant.

The pissing match about the number of plance the PM uses is hardly the main issue. It is just icing on the cake. Consider:
China, Norman, SNC Lavalin, open border, Bombardier, banning handguns and assault rifles to combat Toronto gang/gun crime. Aga Khan Foundation. Butts, Wernick, Omar Khadr, Hillary Cliton Foudation, India, Pipelines, Venezuela, Carbon Tax, Irving Shipyards, Jody Wilson-Raybould, “peoplekind”, Canada has no ‘core identity’, She experienced it differently, “What villa in France?”, , $594 million MSM payoff , adds another $500 million to CBC’s annual budget as soon as he is elected snubs Tori Stafford’s dad Rodney, but welcomed alleged wife abuser and self described “hostage” Joshua Boyle to his office; first Canadian PM guilty of not one, but two ethics violations, Bill M-103 and Islamophobia, Maryam Monsef who lied on her immigration papers about her birthplace, “How does 50 million sound? Let’s do it!”

These are but a small fraction of the idiocies foisted upon us – even before they announced their platform. Now he promises another $100 billion in borrowing, not to mention camping trips for all teh poor people.

Now go read Scheer’s promises – balanced budget year 5, Facilitating global solutions to climate change via innovation / research. Controlling Roxham Road. etc. etc.

Dawn, the issue with the Liberal planes is the hypocrisy – JT talks about the need to reduce our carbon footprint, then uses not one but two planes for his campaign. This comes after he flew from Ottawa to Tofino for a surfing weekend, and then flew back and forth from Florida, where his family was vacationing, to attend meetings in Ottawa, instead of Skyping. The same thing recently happened to Prince Harry – the UK media criticised him for using private jets for several holidays this summer, after he had lectured everyone on the need to reduce their carbon footprint. The “do as I say not as I do” mindset is what irks people.

From what I am reading, the second plane is a 737-200. 737 is on its 4th generation, the 200 is of the original generation.

It’s a fuel guzzler, the design is 45 years old. It’s very noisy, and has no turbo fans. Sounds like a fighter plane when taking off.

This plane is still used by companies flying charter to remote locations like the Yukon and such. It probably is illegal to fly at some of the airports in Canada because of the noise it makes.

Abortion is not going to sway voters. People who love abortion generally don’t vote Conservative. And after Harper did nothing and ran from the issue at every opportunity, nobody actually thinks that Scheer is going to do anything either. The more Trudeau talks about abortion, the more I assume his internal numbers are tanking. It reminds me of Paul Martin huffing and puffing about Harper outlawing abortions in the final days of his 2006 campaign. It was sort of demeaning to see him go on like that.

There isn’t any secret handshake or private meeting in which another story is being told. I know, as I have been on the Conservative electoral district association board in my area for many years. Yet the myth persists in the mind of pro-lifers.

True story: a few years back during a federal election campaign, at a party a Liberal friend of mine was beaking off about how Harper was going to criminalize abortion etc. A Conservative friend of mine immediately challenged my Liberal friend to a bet: I bet you $10,000 that Harper will not touch abortion. After much hemming and hawing, my Liberal friend refused to take the bet. That to me says it all.

Find me any strategist who in her or his gut does not already believe that the Liberals have lost this and I’ll drop dead in astonishment. This thing is over — unless Scheer blows the English-language debate.

But he should come clean about his personal Catholic -based theological position against abortion. However, he has to do it while AT THE SAME TIME pointing out that Trudeau also is/was personally against abortion until at least 2011.

Maybe Trudeau is personally pro-abortion now but how is that different from Scheer practically swearing on the bible that he won’t touch the issue with a ten-foot pole, if elected? Surely, voters can take all the leaders at their word on this most sensitive issue? Why the double-standard affecting only Scheer?

Personally I think the Scheer campaign has been on point almost the whole time. Two Plane Trudeau is going to stick, and the timing was impeccable. It can even be boiled down to emojis easily. Marketers dream.

One mistake was them sending the blackface video to the news media too soon. They should have waited a few days, as it ended up being lumped in with the so called brownface. I think that was a big error. But I’m hoping that just before the english debate the racist nickname comes out. Also would be interesting if the media was able to find someone to talk about what a creep JT is. Or whats up with Melanie Joly.

And finally, no matter what happens now, this election has truly been a joy. Seeing this smug, entitled, narcissist be shown for what he truly is can never be taken away. Now not only can they not call everyone else racists, which they loved to do, but they can’t talk about the environment either. An old gas guzzling massive jet, I mean you can’t even make that up.

If this had been during the English language debate it would be a huge game changer. Time will tell how it sticks.

The problem I had with Iggy is his refusal even after all that time, to give up his home in the US and make Canada permanent. My husband is a dual citizen with Holland. But, he has no real estate in Holland and his home for over 30 years has been here. With Dion, it was different. His inability to speak English clearly and his often spoken love for France is what cast doubt on his allegiance to Canada. Professor and former colleague Denis St. Martin said about him: “His vision of Canada was very influenced by his views on the politics and society of France – very Cartesian, very much about clarity.” I think Dion himself without meaning to, created the issue of dual citizenship. ~L

To be fair, the situations are not directly comparable. Most citizenships other than those that flow from place of birth are elective, one has a claim to citizenship to the citizenship of one’s parents. However, US citizenship (and therefore taxpayer status) does not work that way. You are a US citizen and taxpayer whether you want to be or not. Thousands of Canadians with no tie beyond a grandparent have been arbitrarily saddled with US citizenship, tax-filing obligations – and have to pay a ludicrous fee to go through a slow process of renunciation.

From 2017. Think there is a difference in which other country the citizenship is from. Are we outraged at those with dual citizenship from human rights abusing countries or dictatorships or is this selective outrage?

“As a dual citizenship debacle rocks Australia’s political world, Canada’s Parliament embraces sitting MPs and Senators who were born around the world and hold dual, or even triple, citizenship.

There are now at least 56 sitting parliamentarians — 44 MPs and 12 senators — born in countries outside Canada, according to information from the Library of Parliament and websites.

That figure does not include MPs and senators who hold citizenship through descent, naturalization or marriage.

Canadian MPs hold citizenship from various countries, including Afghanistan, Lebanon, Portugal, Poland, Pakistan, Syria, the United States and the United Kingdom.

At least 22 of them have citizenship from other countries, CBC News confirmed through queries to parliamentarians’ offices.”

Mulcair said he had no intention of renouncing his French citizenship. I *believe* Dion said he’d renounce his French citizenship if he became Prime Minister.

From what I can gather Mulcair wanted to keep his French citizenship for the convenience it afforded him – he cited a situation before he had it in which he had to go into a different immigration line than his French citizen wife & kids at a French (or EU?) airport, and for some reason he found this anxiety inducing (or some such oddness). Well, seems to me that having a PM holding a 2nd citizenship for the convenience it affords sets a terrible example in a country like Canada where we expect new citizens to fully embrace Canadian citizenship and not treat it as a passport of convenience, as so many apparently do nowadays. But maybe that’s just me.

According to Scheer, nobody every asked him about other citizenships, and that’s why we are only now finding out about his US citizenship. Fair enough I suppose. Though it is odd that we are only now finding out. Did not one single reporter or journalist ask him a question that would have brought this up? We know what pets the guy has, but not his other citizenships?????

Now, I’m one of those folks that thinks the *leader* (i.e. the Prime Minister in our case) of a country should not hold other citizenships, as there is at minimum the appearance of divided loyalties. Scheer claims to be in the process of renouncing his US citizenship (that was transmitted from his US dad), and initiated the process after he became Conservative leader. Knowing from bitter experience that it can be a lengthy process to renounce US citizenship, that seems *plausible* and I’m OK with it as long as it’s true (insurance broker issue makes him somewhat less trustworthy in my eyes). So, I’ll be eagerly looking for details on this story to see if they support his narrative.

And, FWIW, the stories I’ve read so far did not indicate Scheer actually attacking anyone’s duel citizenship status. What he apparently did was ask his constituents whether they thought Michaëlle Jean’s duel citizenship was an issue. One can read into that question any number of things, but it’s not an actual attack.

For those that care, it sounds like Scheer has had his US Consulate visit where he formally renounced his US citizenship (yes, a trip to the Consulate is required, can’t be done any other way) and is now waiting for his CLN (Certificate of Loss of Nationality). The CLN can take some weeks to many months to arrive depending on deity knows what. The CLN is what makes it official that one is no longer a US citizen.

[And, BTW, I don’t need anyone to tell me that however trustworthy or not Scheer is, we now know for a fact that Trudeau is *far* from trustworthy]

Personally, I could care less about dual citizenship, at least conceptually. It’s a worthwhile question, however to probe how an individual is using that citizenship. That is, how is he/she demonstrating his loyalty, commitment, etc to Canada. To me, that would be the main question.

175,Warren Kinsella,My latest: why isn’t Andrew Scheer way ahead,2019-10-04 09:48:00,Warren,,"So, Andrew.

You don’t mind if I call you Andrew, do you? It’s better than what I sometimes used to call you, which was Blandy Andy.

I stopped calling you that because you figured out a way to make the bland thing work, like Brampton Bill Davis did. You embraced your inner ordinariness.

You starting hanging out in hockey rinks and you commenced rubbing Timbits all over your torso – which, unlike Prime Minister Blackface, you have never exposed to a grateful nation. You became the Canadian Everyman, and you made it work for you.

The pocketbook stuff, too. That was good, too. You and Hamish concluded, rightly, that voters regard everyone in politics as an unindicted co-conspirators, so you stopped hollering all the time that Justin is a crook. You just kept talking about how hard it is for regular folks to get by, and left the scandalmongering to the media. That was smart.

And the polls bore fruit, sort of. Ipsos says you’re ahead, and you have been for the entirety of the campaign. Nanos says you’re tied with Trudeau for best choice for Prime Minister, which is way better than you’ve been in the past.

But. But, Andrew, seriously?

Why haven’t 110 per cent of respondents declared you their favoured choice for Prime Minister? Why isn’t your party a kabillion points ahead of the Liberals? Why, Andrew, why?

Because that’s the question everyone is asking themselves, Andrew. Hell, that’s the question members of the Liberal caucus are asking themselves – many of whom had purchased political funeral insurance, and now they’re wondering if they can convert it to another kind of policy at the insurance brokerage where you used to fetch coffee and answer the phone.

By any reasonable standard, Andrew, Justin Trudeau leads the most corrupt – the most casually evil – government in Canadian history. It is shiftless; it is reckless; it is soulless. It is a mess.

And they could still win, Andrew. They could still beat you. How can this be?

A scan of Trudeau’s press clippings reads like a grand jury indictment.

• In LavScam, he obstructed justice when he tried, repeatedly, to stop the criminal corruption trial of a Québec-based donor to his party.
• He violated conflict of interest laws when he accepted freebies during a junket to the Aga Khan’s private island.
• He lied about electoral reform, and balancing the budget, and improving relations with the provinces and the world.
• He made us an international laughingstock with his Griswolds Vacation India trip, and enraged the world’s largest democracy – our ally and Commonwealth partner.
• And, most recently, he admitted he repeatedly mocked black people by wearing blackface and jumping around like an ape – and he admitted that there’s more of it out there in the ether, but he doesn’t know how much, because he was wasted a lot of the time.

After all that, Andrew – after all that scandal, more of which this newspaper has been investigating for weeks, stay tuned to this bat-channel, everyone – why aren’t you way ahead? Why aren’t you creaming Chewbacca Socks?

Why, to cite just two examples from the past 24 hours, did you attract fewer people at a Brampton rally than Justin Trudeau’s Portuguese Water Dog, Kenzie, gets during a stroll through the park?

Why can’t you put an end to the interminable questions about your CV, and simply joke that you’re so boring, you’re the only guy in Canada who brags about being an insurance broker?

None of it makes sense, Andrew. None of it. You should be playing Fortnite with Hamish about now, getting ready to move into wherever we put Prime Ministers these days.

Instead, you’re fighting to get a decent lead. Instead, your caucus are whispering about the next leader.

It’s crazy, Andrew. But one thing isn’t crazy at all:
You’ve got three weeks left to win this thing.

And if you don’t, you’ll forever be remembered as the guy who couldn’t beat Prime Minister Blackface","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Minor point, many in the insurance industry, myself included worked as brokers before passing the exams and being licensed. It’s part of the training program where you take courses write tests, prospect for clients and go out on appointments either with a manager or training officer who is licensed and signs the contracts. In my case the commission was held until obtaining my license but was paid a living salary against them. I certainly didn’t fetch coffee and answer the phone and it’s a tad unfair to all aspiring agents and brokers to suggest that’s all they do.

Steve T says:

A couple of immediate reasons I can see for this situation (which I agree is odd). all of which are somewhat soul-destroying as a thoughtful voter:
1. Some people vote the party line regardless of the leader, or the scandals, or how the country is doing. All parties benefit from this to some extent, and clearly the Liberals are benefiting heavily from it right now. They also benefited from it in 2006 and 2008, when they should have been swept into the dustbin.

2. Extending the above, some people vote AGAINST a particular party under all circumstances. When the Liberals were reduced to 3rd party status in 2011, the number of Conservative seats didn’t change as much as the number of Liberal seats. That is to say, a lot of people still voted against the Conservatives – they just chose the NDP rather than the Liberals. This was somewhat true in the 1993 and 1997 elections as well (not so much number of seats, but pure vote count).

3. The third reason, and the most depressing, is that many voters are not particularly bright, and follow the shiny media ball to wherever it takes them next. Equivocation of dissimilar things becomes the norm. One politician tells a massive lie, while his/her opponent says something generally (but not 100%) true, and voters shrug and say “All politicians lie”. One politician breaks a fundamental campaign promise, while his/her opponent introduces a change that is similar but not identical to their promise, and voters shrug and say “Politicians never keep their promises.
Many voters are lazy, disengaged, and think of democracy as a reality TV show. We get the government we deserve.

I knew he was a lousy choice for leader as soon as he won the leadership. The citizenship thing is just a head-smackingly stupid own goal.

A related point is that Rona Ambrose should have run for the leadership. She would have been formidable IMO. Head and shoulders above Scheer.

Ambrose, like all “interim leaders” of all parties, publicly vow not to run for the permanent leadership as a condition of becoming the “interim leader.”

Which was too bad as Rona proved to be a well-liked and effective leader.

Justin Trudeau says people who are running to be Prime Minister have to be honest. This is an amazing display of arrogance, unmitigated gall, and hypocrisy even for Justin.

https://election.ctvnews.ca/have-to-be-honest-with-canadians-when-vying-to-become-pm-trudeau-on-scheer-s-citizenship-1.4624258

Honesty?
Like Justin about blackface?
Like Justin about SNC?
Like Justin about Admiral Norman
Like Justin about JWR?
Like Justin about the latest ethics investigation?
Like Justin about the balancing the budget?
Like Justin about electoral reform?
Like Justin about omnibus bills?
Etc.

Because nobody wants an American former insurance salesman getting his mitts on the Canada Health Act. Most Canadians aren’t conservative. Our phony electoral system lets the news pretend that the party has more support than it does. If we introduced proportional representation, we wouldn’t have another Conservative government for a hundred years.

I agree, but my take is the long campaign of scare tactics on the Conservatives in general has some effect. They’ve basically given up on advancing social conservativism (to my regret, personally), but the media and Liberals have successfully convinced enough of the electorate that they are right wing boogey-men.

That, and the general center-left worldview of most Canadians is a big hill to climb for a Conservative.

Andrew Scheer was (is?) registered for the U.S. military draft, which would make You Know Who his Commander In Chief.

Are you a liberal bot? All American citizens, of which Andrew Scheer was enrolled in their lot without his legal consent, are registered for the draft on their 17 birthday. A big computer running a 13,000 line Cobol program registered him.

That isn’t correct. All American boys, when they reach 18, are required to register. It doesn’t happen automatically, but there can be penalties for failing to register.

A bit exaggerated about where he should be in the polls. There is at least half of the electorate that wouldn’t vote Con to save the planet. But your point is completely fair nonetheless. All four of them are campaigning in fear of offending somebody, presumably the middle, independent voter. But do they not think that voter can smell a snow-job or fatuous blather? Are they so confident of their base that they can count on them not to stay home? I’m Con-leaning, but just this week I’ve come across two Green and NDP supporters who are turned off by their leaders and are counting themselves as undecided.

One yearns for the principled appeals of politicians before the age of polling and bright, young handlers. My model, from the turn of the last century, is the very Catholic British M.P., Hillaire Belloc, who was heckled with cries of “Papist!” at a constituency meeting and answered: “Sir, do you you see this rosary? I say it every morning before my breakfast. I pause at mid-day to say it again. I say it once more before I retire for the night. If that troubles you, Sir, then all I can say is may God spare me the ignominy of representing you in Parliament!”

I’m going to go with Ronald on this one, and predict a Conservative win. I’m basing this on the surprising lack of lawn signs, mostly, and figuring the people will ‘park’ their votes with the Greens or NDP for now but when crunch time comes, they’ll hold their noses and vote Conservative.

Left-wing icon Michael Harris says “Andrew Scheer is about as scary as the Michelin Man”, and I think that is what it will come down to: as much as people may *want* to be afraid of Scheer, they just can’t get that excited about him.

Fred,

What do you think about the latest NANOS? The NDP is at 16, GP at 7. (LPC is at 36, CPC at 33, BQ at 6 and PPC at 2.)

Here’s my expectation: Singh does increasingly well as the campaign advances, particularly after Monday’s debate. My take is that the progressive undecided who can’t support Trudeau and are increasingly dropping May, begin to move in waves to the NDP. If that’s right, counted on Liberal seats flip to the NDP while CPC turnout probably hits a modern record. In short, the Liberal shore gets weathered on both the progressive and conservative side. Not a recipe that Broadhurst and Butts will like.

I think those Green numbers are significant, for the fact that even though a large number of Canadians claim the environment as their top issue, they aren’t being very truthful. Agree with you that those voters will flip to the NDP (barring any more Bozo outbursts from Jagmeet) as soon as stuff starts to get ‘real’. That only helps the Conservatives, as you say.

The bottom line? There are three parties now vying for the ‘progressive’ vote and they can’t all win it.

I agree with all the feedback you are giving Scheer & CPC War Room newbies he hired from the second string cut of the Liberal War Room possible hires, Warren. I also agree with the tone you are taking with them as they deserve it at this juncture of mid stream failure.

I predict a Liberal minority win and a Conservative Leadership Review outcome at the voting booth.

Personally, I think the race is being called now via punditry, but to be honest here I think Scheer has done better than I thought he would. If I were the CPC I, for one, would give Scheer another run for next election given what he has learned to date.

It’s not that complicated. A meaningful climate policy with significant progress is more important to me and my family than which leader is the bigger hypocrite and did the worse things 20 years ago. And a lot of us see the SNC thing as an internal power struggle – and the “Shawcross Doctrine” as less important in priorities than climate policy.
People can support a party and be disappointed in the leader.

I can respect that. I don’t agree, but it’s your vote to cast as you see fit.

The problem you have, though, is that *none* of the parties have a viable environmental policy. The Liberal one is slightly less useless than the Conservative one but will still do absolutely nothing to reduce the dreaded GHGs. The NDP and the Greens have more useful plans but would utterly destroy our economy in the process (and, in the grand scheme of things, still do virtually nothing to save the planet).

The first item is a non story, the other two were settled by the courts and parliament years ago. And to top it off, the Liberals and media think that Scheer is the one holding talks with the Ontario school unions.

Trudeau’s story has changed at least four times since 2001

After media reports revealed that Justin Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the school. It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s story has changed four times since 2001.

First, the Ottawa Citizen reported in 2001 that Trudeau would “give up his teaching job at a Vancouver private school next September to give speeches.” Several days later this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by law firm Heenan Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at a public school.

In his 2014 autobiography, Trudeau says he left the school after a dispute with the administration over an article written in the school newspaper. According to Trudeau, he convinced a student to write an article criticizing the fact that the girls at the school were never reprimanded for the way they dress. This article was deemed disrespectful by the school’s administration.

The Vancouver Sun reported in 2015 that the reason Trudeau left the school was “in part over a dispute over dress code and values.”

In a 2019 book by John Ivison, Trudeau’s departure is summed up as “a disagreement over an article written by a student for which Trudeau was responsible”.

On October 4, 2019 Trudeau said he left the school “because [he] was moving on with [his] life”.

That same day, the former headmaster of the school said that Trudeau left the school because he was going to study to be an engineer.

Why did Justin Trudeau leave West Point Grey Academy? What’s the real reason? Why has his story changed so many times, and if the above reports are incorrect, why hasn’t Trudeau corrected the record?

I hate to spoil all this fun, but shouldn’t those who are anxious to defeat him (me included) start facing up to the fact that it won’t be enough to keep digging out all these sins. It seems to me this is a dangerous drum to keep beating. Some people will change their vote because of the blackface, etc., but hasn’t that been done already and capped? The fact of the matter is Trudeau has a base too and I don’t see them abandoning him because of an article he wrote years ago, or even dissembling about it since. Tell us what you are going to do to improve our lives and the country, Andrew and Jagmeet.

That said, I do savour the idea that JT wanted to be an engineer. Why not a nuclear physicist? I’m guessing he failed the entrance exam and, presumably on his Mom’s advice, decided to lower his sights by becoming a prime minister instead.

When a registered political party of Canada sends a candidate to an election, I as a voter would want to know everything about him/her. EVERYTHING! What are their values? Personal and National. Immigration. Do they work? Where, When, How long? Why did you leave? This is called vetting. I don’t think this was done in Justin Trudeau’s case. If it was how did a US news magazine find and publish “brown face”? Then the “black face” picture surfaced. Did this have anything to do with the $595 million given to the media? Is the media just carrying the water for Trudeau? There’s an old cliche and that is “follow the money”. Or another one that comes to mind is “don’t bite the hand that feeds you”. And now to the ever changing story of why Justin Trudeau left the Point Grey Academy abruptly as reported in some stories. What the actual date of departure? Not to mention what was the reason? And why so many reasons for leaving the same place? Will it take the same US news magazine or a different US news magazine or outlet to report the real reason. If it one of the previously mentioned. Fine then, why the other 3?

Questions for the “moderators”
Did he have his teaching cert suspended?
Did he have inappropriate sexual relations with a student?
Did the student sign and NDA?
If yes to Q2, was it a boy or a girl?

Well – it could be more than one reason – death by a thousand cuts.

Blackface stands out – goes without saying.
He does have a history of groping.He’s been overwhelmingly been proven to lie.
He’s undoubtedly a fake feminist, and quite possibly uses this guise to get closer to women.
We know he bullies women.
He’s a self professed dope smoker (not legal at the time) and possibly on school property?
He has an eye for much younger women – much like PET.
His apartment was known as party central.
Trudeau’s good friend and roommate was a purveyor of child pornography and a convicted pedophile – did Trudeau know this?
Or he may just have been a lousy teacher, he’s not too bright after all.

Vote for him at your peril – it can only get worse.

Not As Advertised.

“Several days later this claim was refuted by Trudeau in a statement issued by law firm Heenan Blaikie. The Montreal Gazette reported Trudeau was accepting a teaching job at a public school.”

If Trudeau was simply moving to a new post at a public school, (mid term?) why would he retain the services of a top notch law firm to communicate this? Fishy or what?

In September if the school year, he was reported by a Vancouver public school administrator to be applying to her for a substitute teacher position. So, he left the private school without a job and was applying to the public system to work part-time. His latest explanation is that it was a career decisions. Some career move!

Why hasn’t Trudeau corrected the record?

Because he’s a spoiled…er, privileged, little boy who’s learned he can lie and obfuscate his way out of a jam.

Justin two jets admires ‘basic dictatorships’ primarily because their leaders actions are not scrutinized by the media and their leaders can banish those who stand up to them to the wilderness (Wilson-Raybould, Philpott, Admiral Norman etc.)

If the unethical, liar in chief is returned to power, what new abuses of power will we see? None. Team Trudeau will censor the internet, and give even more money to Trudeau friendly media.

The school principal from then has already gone public saying Trudeau wasn’t fired and left amicably. No one has produced any evidence to the contrary, only insinuation. There’s no story here. But just like the rumours that Fidel Castro is Justin’s real father (or Birthergate) it seems insinuation is enough for some people.

For those wanting a clearer sense of what reporters are exploring in connection with Trudeau’s departure from West Point Grey Academy, look no further than KinsellaCast 81 (September 28).

Beginning at the 11:45 mark in the podcast, Warren said to Lisa: “You and I have both heard, and certainly I’ve heard, that there are 20 reporters right now – the Star, Globe, CBC, PostMedia – chasing stories: smoking dope with students; supplying dope to students; inappropriate conduct of the #MeToo variety; teaching credentials or academic credentials that are not what people believed they were. All kinds of stuff. It’s turned into a feeding frenzy.”

What we know:JT taught at WPGA from 1998-2001
He then went on to teach at Winston Churchill Secondary from 2001.
He then studied engineering back in École Polytechnique in 2002. Therefore, he may have been at WCSS for one year.
A law firm was involved getting a statement out after his departure from WPGA, correcting for the record.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/justin-trudeau-denies-reports-about-his-future-1.277995?fbclid=IwAR06smPD0oDVrWFh7fkayCtW3W4uNeTqa8_4RQhEKiEGOFCywRQ_Nt0ue4I
JT is on record with multiple reasons as to why he left WPGA (school dress code, wanting to start a family, moving on in his career, etc).
WPGA headmaster at the time has come out refuting any issues surrounding JT leaving WPGA

If what is alleged is true – that he had sexual relations with a student, there is no way he would be allowed to teach while the issue was being investigated.

So that leaves two possibilities: the story is false or it was never reported to the https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/boards-commissions-tribunals/commissioner-for-teacher-regulation

I don’t have any opinions on Trudeau’s conduct – right now, this is gossip – but obviously a person can still teach when they’re being investigated for sexual interference.

Until police arrest a person, they don’t have any conditions limiting their behaviour. Nor do provincial regulatory bodies impose limits on working that apply outside their province (there are ways to do so, but they’re not straightforward or automatic). And those investigations are typically based on cooperation with firsthand witnesses – that’s why often, rich people can get away with bad behaviour by buying silence. And regulatory investigations are generally stopped if the subject voluntarily leaves the profession.

“When I was in Gr.10 at Churchill, my social studies teacher recounted her impression of Justin. She said most of the teachers were in the staff room/lounge that morning and the principal was introducing this new substitute teacher. He had unkempt hair, very casual dress, and was wearing sandals. Most teachers didn’t care much for another new guy and just kept talking among themselves. As soon as the principal said his last name, everyone in the room went silent. “His dad was like a rock star” said by my teacher. She said he taught drama and French for ~2 years and always kept to himself. He rarely associated with other teachers and would eat lunch by himself in his own classroom. Other than that, there wasn’t anything remarkable about his time at SWC. I learned about what he did with his class in 9/11 from his book (autobiography? well I found it in the section along with all the other books written by political leaders) when I was wondering around in Chapters back in August.”

“He was our substitute French teacher at Churchill. Don’t remember much about that time other than his classes were infinitely more interesting than with our actual French 11 teacher.

What I remember most about him was was the day 9/11 occurred. Whereas ever other teacher continued their lesson as if nothing happened, he told us he wasn’t going to teach French. Instead, he wanted to talk about the global ramifications from that event and had an open discussion as to how we thought and felt about the whole situation. He also reminded us not judge a group based on the actions of a few extremists.”

September 11 2001 is clearly AFTER June 2001. Both posts reference that Trudeau was a substitute teacher, not a Fulltime teacher.

I was once the vice-president of a provincial Liberal riding association in the early 90’s. At our Christmas party a man seeking the federal nomination for the 93 election came to meet members. The discussion turned to whether or not Chretien should be appointing candidates instead of them being chosen by the riding. This man said Chretien had to be given the power to appoint people, “Or else you’ll wind up with Sikhs winning nominations”.
I often thought if he had been recorded he would have been in trouble, but in the Liberal Party these things don’t matter. He did go on to sit with Sikhs in the Liberal caucus.

171,Warren Kinsella,My latest: debate? What debate,2019-10-07 12:33:00,Warren,,"Here’s the thing about Monday’s leader’s debate, Canada.

You won’t be watching it.

Well, let’s amend that. Sun readers are a scrappy, elbows-up lot, who dig politics and a good scrap. Sun readers are likelier to be watching the debate. They like debates.

But most everyone else? They won’t be.

Everyone else will be watching Shark Tank (which this election kind of is) or Wheel of Fortune (which this election isn’t). Or, they’ll be binge-watching old episodes of Arrested Development (which neatly describes most of our federal political leaders).

Increasingly, voters simply don’t watch leader’s debates in Canada. For example, Maclean’s magazine put together a debate in 2015, but it had fewer than 40% of the viewers who took in the 2011 English-language debate. And Maclean’s actually counted people who only watched part of that debate, not all of it.

Master Chef got way more viewers.

Last time around, there was a Globe and Mail debate, too, and it was absolutely awful to watch. YouTube later found only about 400,000 Canadians did so. That’s in a country, in 2015, with 36 million people in it. Ipsos later did a poll and found only about 20% of Canadians watched the first couple debates in 2015.

There’s been one debate in 2019 that Justin Trudeau has deigned to attend. It was entirely in French.

Around 1.2 million Quebecers allegedly took in the TVA leader’s debate, in which Andrew Scheer, Jagmeet Singh and the separatist leader, Yves-Francois Blanchet, also participated. In a province with more than six million eligible voters, 1.2 million viewers isn’t anything to brag about, although TVA did.

Oh, and in English Canada — in English — nobody got to watch the French debate when it was happening. Because it was entirely in French. To get a sense of what happened, the vast majority of Canadians needed to check out the media after the fact (Widely-held consensus: the separatist guy won, hands down).

As someone who owns a public opinion firm — Daisy Data, at your service! — I can relate one empirical statistical fact: a dwindling number of voters watch debates from gavel to gavel. They may in take part of a debate, sure. But not all of it.

What voters do, instead, is watch the news media’s coverage of a debate. They’ll see a clip of a fiery exchange on TV, or they’ll hear a so-called defining moment on the radio heading into work, or they’ll read expert commentary in the pages of the Sun and hopefully nowhere else.

But they don’t watch all of the debate.

I’ve prepared prime ministers and premiers for debates, and I now know I did it all wrong. I assumed, as did my debate-prep colleagues, that everyone else watched the debates as closely as we did. That was a flawed assumption.

It also explains how Justin Trudeau was seen as a winner in the 2015 debates, even against two superior debaters — Stephen Harper and Thomas Mulcair. Trudeau’s strategy in 2015 was a lot like what he did in his celebrated boxing match with Patrick Brazeau: he waited in his corner for an opening, then he’d go in with a flurry of punches.

He didn’t try to dominate all of the matches — he just did what he needed to do to get clipped on TV, then he’d sprinkle the results all over social media.

It worked, because he knew that Canadians were more likely to see clips of a debate than all of a debate.

That’s what he’s going to do on Monday night, too. In an era of shrinking debate audiences, it works. Will the other leaders let him get away with it in 2019 like they did in 2015? Tune in and see.

Or, join everyone else, and go watch Shark Tank.

Sure, Trudeau surpassed his rather low expectations in 2015. But this time, our expectations are high or to put it another way, he can’t be seen as having been on the ropes, even once, otherwise it’s a clear loss.

Doubt Scheer can manage to land a solid blow but Singh will go in for the political kill early and my money’s on him to land quite a few doozies that will send Trudeau spinning.

Twenty more years of Great Leader Groper, and then his son Dear Leader can take over. Just ignore that he wore blackface on numerous occasions, groped women, elbowed a female MP in parliament, fired a First Nation’s attorney general so he could break the ethics laws twice, etc, etc. Just adore his good looks and slightly wind blown hair. The Toronto Star urges everyone to vote Liberal.

True, but also pathetic and sad. What a society we have become.

No wonder complex ideas no longer resonate with people, and therefore don’t get support. That may have been the case for some time, but now it’s like we don’t even trust the experts who distill complex ideas into real-world solutions. We are more likely to believe a simplified falsehood told by a non-expert (eg: vaccines cause autism) than a complex truth told by someone with training.

The left is just as guilty as the right in this area. Why else are (at least) two of the federal parties willing to essentially shut down Canada’s oil and gas sector, for the nebulous outcome of “solving climate change” (which it won’t actually do)? Because a simple answer resonates with lazy voters more than a complex answer.

Jagmeet Singh is the clear winner for the debate. Andrew Scheer is obviously a guy that eats kittens like Steven Harper does. Elizabeth May is the old guard politician of the bunch and I respect her position on the rights of women in Canada.
What is glaringly obvious is that she is right that little girls need to see women leaders in debate for the helm in Parliament. She is wholly correct to point that out to all Canadians.

Mad Max is mad as a hatter. Trudeau held his own and looks like the leader on LPC policy stance. He was prepped for debate well. Mr B. from Quebec has a nice voice but strange ideas about provincial autonomy & transfer payment obligations.

Scheer will make a good standing but not enough to beat Mr. T. & LPC IMHO.

Singh is a quality politician and well educated too.

Fred,

Scheer made a number of amateur mistakes: first off, too preachy and judgmental. That’s for voters to decide but a lot of the Reformers just can’t help themselves. Second: When I’m Prime Minister…far too presumptuous for the undecided. Add to that that his climate plan is a certifiable joke and he lost ground last night. He should have talked about an eventual CPC oil and gas transition plan for Alberta but he pretends that the inevitable doesn’t even exist. He came off almost as phoney as Trudeau and Justin is hard to beat in that department.

Don’t know if it’s enough to cut his majority to a minority. If so, Scheer has only himself to blame.

Singh had a chance to knockout Trudeau, but he was too nice to take it.

On Bill 21. He should have comeback on Trudeau with: “There is no reason to take lectures on how to defend racialized Canadians from a rich white guy who cannot recall how many times he has worn blackface!”

Too nice? Perhaps he’s only as disingenuous as every other leader. He’s not stupid, has said he won’t support a conservative minority – he can’t possibly forfeit balance of power to the Green Party.
Also while jabbing Trudeau may have lost him what is left of the orange wave in Quebec, it may have made him look good in 905 and Toronto enough to pave the way for a conservative minority.
Simple math only one – the blue party will ever govern remotely to the right. No party will in a minority. The red party will govern more to the centre if the golden boy is replaced but will have to cozy to the left for power in a minority.
So credit Singh with understanding the best scenario for team orange is balance of power.
Disingenuousity – it’s how we campaign in Canada.

Gee Blackface Justin lecturing the NDP leader on human rights. Groper sure likes to put brown faced people in their place. If your planning on voting Conservative stay at home, because Liz May decided that the Conservatives can not win the election. And Groper must have been tired after the debate, because he only mentioned Doug Ford twice at the press scrum after the debate.

There are countless ways to spin the debate. Here’s my take:Trudeau: Stiff, used prepared talking points throughout, as though he knew the questions. Butts’ convo last week with Althia paid off. Never directly answered a single question. Looked stiff & uncomfortable, as though he had some deep legal issues weighing heavily upon him.
Singh: I actually like this guy, just not his politics. Promises lots of free stuff without any obvious plan how he will pay for it.
May: Nice old cat lady. Again, lots of pie in the sky promises while destroying Canadian industries & infrastructure to pay for it.
Blanchet: Quebec, Quebec, Quebec…as to be expected.
Bernier: Not sure what he was doing here. Contributed nothing of import. Attacked Scheer all night leading me to believe that he doesn’t care about the greater election, just wants his revenge for losing the leadership vote.
Scheer: Poised, calm, articulated his policies well and delivered the first damaging punch right up front, “Mr. Trudeau, you’re a phoney and you’re a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country”, followed by “There is a vacancy for the Ontario Liberal leadership and if you are so focused on provincial politics, go and run for the leadership of that party.”
While it is hard to pick a winner and a loser in these kind of formatted debates, Trudeau failed to impress, Scheer owned Trudeau’s ass from the start. The rest don’t matter.

Vote rich Ontario is a kingmaker in elections. If Alberta wants to win any fed election it had better understand how to capture vote rich Ontario & the Greater Toronto Area-GTA.

Moving the Conservative plan towards the center of politics in Canada is the only way you will ever attain some semblance of power in Parliament, Alberta Steve.

The rest always matters especially when it comes to the West in politics at the fed level.

The Conservative plan is closer to center than it has ever been, regrettably. So much so that they are starting to look like the Liberals of the 90’s. I am all for give & take but to a point, otherwise why have different parties? There is nothing wrong being right of centre. Maybe we need to redefine what centre is?

I feel the same. The last time this happened, Reform was born and the Progressive Conservative Party was destroyed.

We just don’t need two Liberal parties in Canada. I wish the CPC could get that through their heads, because now Max Bernier is apparently the ‘real’ Conservative option.

Douglas,

How many of Singh’s possible votes watched this charade of a debate all the way through (if at all) would be the question. Anyone know the ratings?

Best possible outcome would be the NDP take back the votes they lost to Trudeau’s smarmy grin and promises on electoral reform. What surprises me, is Singh is not particularly vocal on this?

My hope there’s a lot of disenchanted blue liberals who see Trudeau as the phoney and fraud that he is, will vote conservative. I don’t see the young and indigenous vote rushing out to vote for Trudeau as in 2015 – the NDP and greens will split them. I predict a much lower turnout overall and that should benefit Scheer – conservatives will get out and vote. Let’s hope!

Trudeau – Not As Advertised.

Agreed: too many leaders, too many moderators. Production was a mess. I’m also sick of media always declaring there was no knockout punch, when it is plainly obvious that JT was crushed repeatedly like an empty can of buck a beer.

May: she sure loves Yellowknife

JT: run down in broad daylight and everyone knows it. The exchange re. JWR is the only thing most viewers will take away from the evening and Scheer was smart to get it in early.

Scheer: reminded about 40% of Canadians what they grudgingly liked about Harper

Blanchet: carries on well with the BQ tradition of smart ass complainy-head leaders. Also has a career in radio broadcasting with that voice if politics doesn’t work out.

Singh: reasonable, sincere… doesn’t win the race.

I’ve enjoyed your site for a long time. I tend to agree with most of your commentary and over the last four years, have certainly had reason to become disenfranchised with politics as a whole.

I had to comment though, I don’t love your continued comments on Trudeau possibly having coloured his hair. I find it distasteful. We would be critical of someone who commented on a woman who may have coloured their hair. Who cares if he did, it’s a non-issue, certainly non impactful to his abilities or inabilities as a leader. I have long regretted the day I complimented on my (male) manager’s hair after he had lightly coloured to remove the grey.

Trudeau got crushed. Contrary to what was said above, Scheer’s over the top attack on Trudeau left him completely rattled. See rest of debate for examples. This wasn’t rope-a-dope. This was getting rocked in the opening 15 seconds of round 1 and then spend the rest of the night on the ropes getting beaten.

Scheer reminded me very much of Harper in the way he answered questions. He even had the same cadence and dewy soft voice. The Tories must employ professional coaches. Trudeau looked ridiculous. Gasping for answers. This man is our prime minister? Are we completely undignified as a country.

Cape Breton Liberal candidate posted this on social media : “why do skinny aboriginal girls make me wonder if they’re on pills or crystal meth”? It was in 2013, when he was 30, with a law degree in his back pocket. Same guy made jokes about being in a car stopped by RCMP for drinking and driving – and posted the photo on line. Somehow, the cracker jack LPC ‘Green Light’ vetting committee process missed all this! So how does the ‘Fake Feminist and Phony Indigenous Champion’ Justin respond last night?

JT: ” he took responsibility…. he apologized”.

Last night the same candidate said on CBC radio in Cape Breton: “I spoke with the Prime Minister, he’s got my back”.

And that, my friends, is Justin’s version of Reconciliation!

Scheer was a raging dull dud from the word go. He disregarded the very first question of the debate from a citizen put to him, and instead went off into a tirade on Trudeau. Rude. I’ll repeat– RUDE. A dull plodding man of little wit getting angry, without any plan but Con boilerplate policy of eons extant, is not PM material.

Singh was best by a country mile.

Blanchet apologized for Quebec’s xenophobia as if being bigoted was just the most natural thing in the world.

Trudeau anointed himself climate champion, May couldn’t get a word in edgewise and got shouted over. Bernier – good god, he almost beat Scheer to become Con leader, think of that! He has one atribute that matches Scheer — slow-witted dullness.

Scheer won silver? In your dreams. I’m embarrassed for him watching him at work. There was a winner, four second places and the man who needs therapy came last.

4 years ago if another leader had called Trudeau a fraud it would have backfired big time. In Canada you can’t just attack another candidate in such personal terms, unless it is widely agreed that there is a basis for the attack.

There are a few commentators saying that Scheer went over the top, and Trudeau’s main supporters are crying foul. But there is a major lack at outrage at the attack. This is because most Canadians who watched the debate were a bit shocked by the directness of the attack but were also nodding and thinking something like “wow, I guess that is right”.

It’s not just him that’s a disgrace Warren. It’s te entire Liberal Party of Canada. Even his father–a communist loving, Islamist supporting, unionist, clown shoe, himself was as much a dolt as is his son. The difference of course, is intellect. The senior Trudeau, like, him or hate him could “make his argument” without ever attacking “the man.” He could stay on point. Recall, if you will, Trudeau’s eulogy to his father… He described how his father made him apologise for attacking a political rival on a personal level and made him apologise…. This idiot; this so called PM, this racist, bigotted, misogynist and possibly nefarious idiot owes not just his political opponents and every citizen that opposes his politics, an apology.

Here’s another doozie of a question for you and if you want to address it, I’d like to hear your answer…

Given Trudeau’s faux personae and given the rumors coming out of his dismissal as a teacher and given his treatment of female staffers and his unsolicited advances towards women via creepy touching and “close quarters” engagement—I mean, he’s pretty much lying on top of women when he speaks to them…. Where the hell is his wife? What the hell happened to his “storybook” romance and strong family values? Aside from the photo op on first day of school, she’s no longer around.

I get that the wives of PM’s tend to be coat racks that get wheeled out every now an again but there was a huge push on them as a couple and when he started to break rules, when he started to treat women like any “toxic masculine male” such as myself said he would, the day he was elected… Gone. Crickets…

Something is fishy beyond his politics. (I heard–second hand–from someone that knows a Toronto woman he had a tryst with,) that he has a real problem with the zipper on his slacks… (Please don’t include this last paragraph. It’s second hand and I was only sharing because the person—this woman’s ex boyfriend–told me about it this week.)

This Trudeau guy ain’t right in the head…. He just isn’t. He’s like Creepy Joe Biden… One thing we all can agree on though–he’s the best thing to happen to the conservative movement in 60 years…

Not surprising to see this, but I’m sure the fair and balanced media team behind the show will also have all other party leaders in as well and obviously prior to the election.
BTW Trudeau and Libs along with Jerry Dias were prepared to use children as pawns in that threatened Ontario education strike, so it’s no surprise they are happy to use them here.

163,Warren Kinsella,The rumours about Justin Trudeau,2019-10-09 12:22:00,Warren,,"Rumours. It’s more than a Fleetwood Mac album.

Rumours about Justin Trudeau have littered Canadian newsrooms like confetti since the start of this election. Rumours about Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.

As we now know, some of the rumours about the Liberal leader turned out to be true.

So, in 2014, this writer was told there were affidavits detailing inappropriate conduct between Trudeau and various young people. I simply did not believe it, but I raised the allegation directly with Trudeau’s most-senior adviser.

To my surprise, he acknowledged the allegations had been made in affidavits, but said that Trudeau’s insular inner circle were not worried. They had rebutting affidavits of their own to respond.

Subsequently, a female parliamentarian sent me an editorial written by a B.C. reporter in which she alleged that Trudeau had groped her, quote unquote, at a beer festival. While Trudeau said he did not act inappropriately, he apologized, saying “people can experience interactions differently.”

In 2016 and again in 2017, this writer was told by a senior Liberal that photos existed of Trudeau wearing blackface, dating back to his time as a teacher at a private school in Vancouver. The Liberal war room knew about the photos, he said.

Efforts to find any proof, however, were unsuccessful. It did not occur to us to simply check the private school’s year books. I — and others, as it turned out — did not believe Trudeau could be that stupid. To pose for photographers wearing blackface.

But it was true: At the age of 29, while a teacher and in a position of responsibility with children, Trudeau had indeed partied in racist blackface. Turned out he had done it several times, too.

Did the blackface rumour — now the blackface fact — mean that Trudeau was a racist? In no time, several non-white Liberal MPs hustled to microphones to say that, sure, the blackface incidents had happened. But Trudeau wasn’t a closeted drawing-room bigot, they insisted.

And then Omer Aziz, a former Trudeau government aide, authored a scalding op-ed in the Globe and Mail. He wrote about Trudeau and his inner circle, and their attitudes towards minorities: “Condescending attitudes were regularly revealed. Minorities were undermined, ghettoized. The casual disregard of the privileged was systemic. I felt like I could not breathe.” Aziz quit.

Those are just some of the rumours. Some turned out to be true, others are just false, or without a shred of proof. One is presently making the rounds on a fake-news website that has fooled many in the past, this writer included. It should not be taken seriously, in any way.

But those of us privileged to hold positions in the news media, whether we admire Trudeau or not, have an obligation to investigate and report. When the subject-matter is the prime minister of Canada — a man who has repeatedly held himself out as a feminist and anti-racist and a family man — we in the media owe our readers and our listeners the truth.

On a segment on a Toronto radio program this week, and in an opinion piece on Canadaland, this writer was criticized for wondering, in a single tweet, why a Globe and Mail reporter asked Trudeau about why he abruptly left the aforementioned Vancouver private school. My answer: Because it is relevant. Because it is newsworthy. Because it is important.

When the media start acting as an extension of any political party’s war room — when we proactively self-censor — we do our readers and listeners a grave disservice. We work for them, after all.

So a brave soon to be unemployed CBC reporter saw the video clip of Liberal MP Judy Sgro defending Groper wearing blackface, and asked the NDP leader about it. He was not impressed. Sgro has since apologized for saying black people are proud of Groper wearing blackface and it was just overblown in the media. Must be Doug Ford’s fault.

what continues to stun me is that there is no traction to these stories in the media. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE in the Canadian political spectrum who would not be pushed through the incinerator of public opinion without trial? Take poor Patrick Brown, not quite the range of rumours but enough to bury him in days. Jack Layton’s massage parlour thing may have taken away the prime minister’s office. How does spawn of Castro get away with it (okay a rumour for sure but surely Trudeau must have some cloak of immunity not available to mere mortals.

We don’t need more grist for the rumor mill. I’m certain there’s more dirt out there but Liberal MSM consider it impolitic given they’re in Truduck’s pocket. But what we have is enough. Trudeau’s core support of the apathetic and uninformed is fickle. He’s as stupid as they are but savvy Canadians have Truduck’s number. The polls are beginning to acknowledge what the coffee shops have known for half a year. Truduck is a loser and must be humiliated from Papineau as well as from Ottawa with his villainous gang of Ultra-progressive minions. Then it will be Hallelujah, free at last from this abomination.

Mr. Kinsella,

Your courage as a Liberal reporting these matters touching on the heir apparent’s apparent gross hypocrisy is commendable.

Perhaps some brave Canadians want to say it as it is before an Election (in which Trudeau could re-elected), and are worried about another 4 years of this…but see the personal risk that they face (to wit, as occurred in the case of Vice-Admiral Norman).

In other words, he’s a vindictive little hypocrite too!

If he’s re-elected look forward to audits from CRA.

There will be a list I’m sure. Maybe true patriots, and the intellectually honest will be on the list.

Watch your back!

Best,

Sheila Copps has already identified Warren Kinsella as being the most intellectually honest Canadian Journalist in the land.
Warren is undoubtedly top of the list, and I’ll bet dollars-to-donuts that Mr. Butts reads this website too.

Warren Kinsella is sweetness & light whereas Mr. Butts is the Prince of Darkness.

I’m a Liberal so Warren need not worry about his back.

I have more faith in the CRA and the independence of federal employees than to think they would cave to demands for partisan audits by elected politicians. Even though our politics is deeply uninspiring these days we are not in fact a banana republic. It’s important to keep perspective sometimes.

The big Ottawa rumor that I keep hearing about Trudeau is that he’s a compulsive serial adulterer who uses the Liberal staff pool (including men as well as women) as his personal harem. He’s allegedly slept with a very large number of people who work for him.

DISCLAIMER: All of this is third hand and I don’t know the truth. It could be exaggerated. Who knows? But that’s what people say around these parts. I’m not claiming anything myself, just reporting chatter.

With all due respect, this column is not particularly helpful in resolving the on-going issue of Trudeau’s credibility, behaviour and character. While on one hand the suggestion is made that rumours about Trudeau often prove to be true, on the other there is an allusion that the current rumour concerning inappropriate relations with a student is false because of its appearance in a supposedly questionable source despite another reputable media source pursuing the story first. The former makes one wonder whether Mr. Kinsella is attempting to dance around a super-injunction (where even the publication of the existence of an injunction is banned given that such information would be as damaging as the basis of the injunction itself) as his continued failure to state outright that there is no truth to this rumour speaks volumes. Combining that with the ‘smoke’ that: 1) Trudeau has a propensity to lie, 2) he left right in the middle of a school year (what dedicated teacher with only wonderful memories of the time does that without a good reason?), 3) the reason for his leaving has kept changing (e.g., there was not a fit because a student was disciplined, he simply moved on, a leave of absence to spend time with family, etc.), 4) he hired a high-priced law firm to issue a statement about a simple, inconsequential act, 5) the allusion from his wife and the existence of rumours that he is a serial philanderer, and 6) supposedly the media source that was pursuing the source was delayed in distributing its print edition on the day that the story was to break (at which time Mr. Kinsella—who likely has inside information—simply stated that the story was not coming rather than the story was not coming because the rumours were false or could not be substantiated) suggest that there is a fire. I would be interested in being corrected if any of this is invalid.

Notwithstanding the fake (ish) “Buffalo Chronicle” article some have referenced here, I personally have ZERO doubt in my mind that hush money and NDA’s have been in play with former students and/or staff at the West Point Grey Academy.

A question though, why isn’t Trudeau suing them? Perhaps to keep the spotlight off it I suppose, and he could be waiting till after the election.

Or maybe he knows he wouldn’t have a case to sue them..

I am just sorry that it will not all be revealed before the election. I really wonder what the legal bills & shush money is costing the party & Trudeau personally. And then there will likely be a divorce settlement in his near future.

Surely media can report if a NDA has been made/paid for, even if it cannot state the reason.?

The thing I keep in mind the most about Trudeau is how (if) he gets in and got in.

What is it, any other politician would be relegated to the dust bin by now, had they done what he has.

It’s not his intellect, seriously I can’t remember ever listening to a politician who sounded dumber and as out of touch as he does.

Even Warren, who said Trudeau just threw away the election back in 2015 when Trudeau said convicted terrorists with dual citizenship deserved to stay Canadian citizens and would repeal the law that stripped them of it.

How the hell did he still win after that?

Until now I’ve always been firm in the belief that the people are always right.

While I am glad that Singh’s skin color is not an impediment to his success, I wouldn’t go as far as saying it should have any bearing on his success.

Unfortunately, I think some people feel inclined to vote for certain candidates as a way to show their “woke” status, so they can participate in self-congratulatory discussions. Voting should be based on the merits of the party’s policies and platform, and the ability of the party’s leadership to enact those policies and platform. Nothing more and nothing less.

I do admire Mr. Singh. But I don’t wish his party well.

While I tend to vote right wing it is not because of a blind belief in capitalism. It is largely because I don’t feel the Liberal party of my forefathers remains. It certainly has lost it’s bearing as centrist.

I think it is time for a new Liberal-Conservative movement. Let’s call it “TRUE Blue GRIT” that stands up WITH small C conservative Canadians and governs, campaigns and damn right lives in the middle of the political spectrum.

Not necessarily perfect judged by today’s lens, but ideal for it’s time was Conservative McDonald and Liberal Brown being able to set aside their true hatred till they were able to work together well enough to forge this great nation.

We are at a time when the leaders of the two largest parties need to if only for a period put aside their mutual hate.

Warren in past elections has written a lot about how Liberals and Dippers are different. I believe sincerely that the Liberal party loved by Mr. Kinsella and once loved by me has been raped and pillaged and is fighting to out-left the NDP.

I don’t know – He and I may even agree on that point now, but I think he feels the crime occurred only under Justin Trudeau.

I believe the centrist liberals of my parents generation even from before an earlier Trudeau have as much in common with the conservative movement in Canada today as with any other party. I don’t believe we are centre left as a society we are centrist on the whole.

We are all bemoaning that this is a horrible campaign, what a shame the best leaders in most peoples eyes are leading the fringe parties. With apologies to the NDP supporters out there, they have governed Canada exactly as many time as I have personally so fringe fits till it doesn’t.

Let Maxine Bernier collect the right wing knuckle draggers further away from mainstream conservatism.
However, let us not give the radical left a free ride where centrism disappears from Liberal political thought.

Mr Singh may be bigger than his party at the moment but the diehard left of the NDP are every bit as extreme as the PPC are on the right.

I’d like to see a minority parliament where someone other than Trudeau leads a liberal coalition with a conservative partner that both come back to the middle.

This coalition could give the Bloc the middle finger, while working for a truly better Canada where the masses agree the poor and downtrodden are everyone’s responsibility but also recognizes that the middle class needs to be grown and fed, not lived off as pawns and most importantly where we can work to both address climate concerns and Alberta’s energy economy.

We can truly be the country that lady liberty describes but does not deliver in our southern neighbour. Build our economy and stop to help our fellow Canadians while putting aside the urge to villainize those who are most like us but don’t vote as we do.

Give me a Jagmeet Singh that leads that party and I’m in.

But as long as the NDP is socialist, it is just too close to communist for my liking.

With 150 seats each the Liberals could afford to send people like Judy Sgro to the back benches and encourage Trudeau to walk away. Conservatives could abandon the most extreme of their members and a couple hundred good men and women could coalesce for a decade of enlightened parliament.

This just continues to reinforce that Junior clearly believes Quebeckers and, by extension, himself, are better than the rest of Canada.

Right. Anyone in doubt that the Libs are losing the election need only look at the Lib-funded media; THEY sure aren’t acting like the Libs are winning are they? If the Libs were winning, would they have needed to give Trudeau a special platform on CTV National News etc. etc. etc.

It seems strange that the CBC is upset that the Conservatives used clips from their network, when I can remember quite clearly during the last Ontario provincial election, the Liberals using CBC clips in papers and TV ads.

You know me, I don’t exactly send Trudeau bouquets of flowers but at least he was honest that it’s Quebec’s jurisdiction at that level and that it’s not for him to intervene. Again, he was more honest than previously in saying that in the areas clearly covered by federal jurisdiction on immigration that he would not rule out an eventual court challenge to Bill 21. But trying to have it both ways rarely works. You tend to piss people off on both sides of the divide.

But the litigants in court are pretty damned smart — challenging Bill 21 using Charter sections not subject to the Notwithstanding Clause. As we say around here: chapeau!

Mr. O’Dowd “at least he was honest that it’s Quebec’s jurisdiction at that level and that it’s not for him to intervene”. You are a fool or naive. Which is it. Justin tells English Canada during one debate that he “might” vaguely intervene. And then in the French debate for Quebecers, where Bill 21 is popular, that its not for him to intervene. So, Mr. O’Dowd, what are you?

We DON’T support it, that’s the point. IT IS Quebec’s jurisdiction, and that is what Ronald meant when he said at least Trudeau was being honest about that ( “More honest” than previously claiming he might intervene).

Followed by this:

Max,

Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear enough for you so here it goes: the part you quoted is about Quebec’s right under her jurisdiction to create and impose a values test. That’s a narrow point of law.

But Trudeau also said that the federal concurrent and primary power over immigration would legitimately allow them to properly contest Bill 21 in the courts. That amounts to a general legal principle and right. No matter who wins, I expect to see Ottawa eventually intervene in the case at bar.

I partially support Bill 21 as regards judges, peace and police officers and correctional officials but not the part governing health sector workers or teachers, as they are not legal representatives of the State.

Sorry Montréalaise but you’re wrong. Bloc reinvigoration has absolutely nothing to do with present Liberal support in Quebec, or Trudeau’s positioning. Their numbers have everything to do with the fact that Singh is neither a francophone Québécois, nor very sad to say it, white. It’s all about subtle, unexpressed racism at work, in some quarters, not Bill 21.

So you can’t seem to swing a dead cat around the CBC website without running into a story about brownface needing a security detail and a bullet proof vest.

I’m going to come off as really cynical here, please consider the target’s past actions. DOES ANYONE else think this was just another role being played?

For one thing, wouldn’t most leader events have a security detail at this point in the writ period?

I do not wish to live in a society where leaders are assassinated. I am also not naive to the possibility as well. Hell, a senior in-the-back-pocket-of-the-emporer civil servant ranted about the possibility in the SNC Lavalin hearings.

What I just cant think past is this a case of reality or a case of orchestration?

The voice clips of Turdo that were on the CBC this morning yelling into a microphone sounded every bit as desparate as Paul Martin practically fornicating on the stage with Buzz Hargrove a decade ago.

Did Brownface create a stir? Is the story a desperate Schtick to remind us all of what living in a conservative world would be like?

Has he ever donned a mask before? Why couldn’t the bullet proof vest be a prop? It is not beneath this man because well, not much is beneath this man. I know because I was cleaning scum from my pond this morning and just beneath that I am pretty sure I saw that lying racist bastard.

157,Warren Kinsella,CBC vs. CPC: when bias isn’t just perceived anymore,2019-10-13 07:44:00,Warren,,"A reasonable apprehension of bias — that’s what we learned to call it in law school.

It’s the legal standard, in Canadian law, for disqualifying a judge or decision-maker in an administrative tribunal.

Bias is prejudice, mostly. It’s an unreasonably hostile feeling or opinion about a person or group. In law, we learned, it can be “real” or “perceived.” That is, it doesn’t have to actually happen right out in the open — the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled it can even happen when a decision-maker “might have” acted unfairly.

That’s when a judge or a decision-maker can be disqualified, and kicked off a case. But is a reporter a decision-maker, in the legal sense?

It’s not a question reserved for legal scholars, hidden away behind stacks of musty old volumes in a law library somewhere. On Friday, it became a question for the rest of us, too.

On Friday, the CBC — along with their newsreader Rosemary Barton, and Parliamentary Bureau reporter Jean-Paul Tasker — sued the Conservative Party of Canada. For real.

Their complaint: on the Internet, the Tories used 17 seconds of CBC video. About the Tories.



As the Conservative Party wrote in a release: “The 17 seconds of CBC clips in the video included (Postmedia columnist) Andrew Coyne highlighting how Justin Trudeau broke the law, Justin Trudeau telling a Canadian war veteran that he is ‘asking for more than we can give right now,’ and one CBC reporter questioning why the Liberals provided Loblaws with $12 million in tax dollars to install new refrigerators.”

When this writer heard about the lawsuit, it sounded like a joke, or an Internet meme. It was farcical.

Now, Conservatives have had a long (and sometimes also unreasonable) dislike for the CBC. Voters who identify themselves as conservative are acutely focused on media bias, particularly as it exists at progressive media organizations like CBC.

A number of Rasmussen polls conducted in the U.S. during the 2012 and 2016 presidential races found that two out of three conservative voters — and sometimes as many as three out of four — felt the media give progressive politicians a much easier time. They believe media bias is real.

So, when Justin Trudeau confidante Gerald Butts was recently photographed alone at an intimate dinner with Huffington Post Ottawa bureau chief Althia Raj — an English leaders’ debate moderator — Conservatives were apoplectic. It showed an inappropriate bias, they said.


Maybe so. Butts, for his part, was doing what politicos always do — he was trying to influence the media. Fine.

Raj, however, was doing something undeniably foolish. She was meeting privately with the most powerful unelected Liberal just before a critical debate, and thereby creating a perception that she would treat the Liberal leader differently.

Because Raj’s commentary has always been characterized by a pro-Trudeau tilt, a perception of bias was not unreasonable. At all.

In the case of the CBC lawsuit against the Conservative Party, however, the bias is not merely perceived. It is real. And it inarguably disqualifies Barton, Tasker and the CBC — all important decision-makers about the information millions of Canadians receive during this election — from broadcasting anything about the Conservative Party.



Truly: how can Andrew Scheer, or any of his candidates, now believe that the CBC will treat them fairly in news coverage? More importantly, how can the CBC’s viewers and listeners now believe that what they are seeing and hearing is free of bias?

After all, how the CBC handles a news story — how it writes it, how it edits it, how it headlines and promotes it — can destroy a political career in short order.

The CBC has said it was the “driver” behind the lawsuit, not the journalists. And it plans to remove the journalists from the lawsuit.

Whether they intended it or not, the CBC and Barton and Tasker have provided clear evidence of an appalling bias. They have shown they are utterly disinterested in being fair.

That lawsuit wasn’t a legal action. Given that the Tories now may win the election, it was a political suicide note","<div class=""articlecontent"">

This is going to be a tough write for me.

I have felt there has been a bias against conservative thought for a very long time. Sorry Warren, but your hero Jean Chrétien was an artist at not just beating but villainizing his opponent, those of us who had left the Liberal party felt branded as extreme, only because we didn’t agree with the little guy from Shawinigan.

Preston Manning lamented the media bias – liberals laughed. I see those moronic “I am voting CBC” signs and I wonder how NOT watching and rallying to the cry of a privately funded broadcaster made me unCanadian?

When I made the decision to jump the queue and pay for a procedure in the USA I was again unCanadian. (forgive me with a long family history of throat cancer I felt waiting 24 months for a scope was a little long)

So I have taken personally a lot of the accusations that I am somehow wrong just because I disagree. That is not very Canadian and it should not stand.

I happen to feel every bit Canadian, I actually look for Canadian products and I go out of my way to tell my American little tidbits like the fact Baseball was first played here, and basketball, the telephone, and other items were invented by Canadians.

So forgive me when I feel that those who support the CBC because it is the public broadcaster are fools for not being able to see as a mature country we have private sector broadcasters who can deliver any great Canadiana without the massive bias that is the CBC.

This is proof positive that we do not need the CBC. BURY IT ALIVE.

If a Sunmedia or CTV or other private broadcaster feels the need to sue one of the major political parties let them have at it. It is their intellectual property being taken.

But for CBC to sue any party in this fashion is simply unfair.

I think the funding should be slashed to the levels of a TVO type, no hockey, no national news, and have all the private affiliates who are left sold off as well as the premium slots afforded the “national network” in many major markets.

This would be no different for me if the suit were against The racist lead Liberal Party of Canada.

It is no different than Russian intervention in the US outcome.

A publicly funded organization is setting aside bias to support the ruling party. (Please read the previous sentence and think of the need for Glasnost under Gorbachev).

Again it’s a personal rant but there is no room for any public money to fund the Liberal party because it has simply seen to that funding.

Yes we have the private sector. But in Quebec, the market is not the same! On TV, we have only two networks who make news (we have a third network but they don’t make news since many years because of money. They prefer to make reality show like the bachelor). If CBC is defunded, Radio-Canada would be too. And only TVA would make news on TV. But remember, the owner of TVA (Quebecor) own manual things. They have newspapers, many TV channels, one provider (Vidéotron) etc. So if a scandal happens at Quebecor, they will not talk about it. They will talk also about the new TV service of Vidéotron or the return of a serie on TVA. So, we need Radio-Canada here. We have press and Radio. But the Radio-Canada of Radio-Canada make good programs. In English, you have two networks too : global and CTV. They can make news because there is a lot of audience. Here in Quebec, it’s not the same. The market is not big like the English market. So think about it. Because everybody talks about cbc but Radio-Canada make nothing. And persons want to defund it. After they say what we need diversity of informations. If they think that it will help here…

Harper was in a position to get votes (or abstentions) from different parties at different times, so he was not beholden to the Bloc or any other one opposition party.

I still deplore his “Quebec is a nation within Canada” motion.

At the moment, I’m concerned with the Conservative promise to let Revenue Quebec administer the collection of federal taxes. I think that’s madness; but if the Conservatives are in a position of having to depend on the Bloc to stay in power, it’s all the more likely to go ahead.

It is completely perplexing that the CBC leadership would approve legal action against the CPC at this juncture in an election too close to call, over such an insignificant and truly unremarkable use of their copyright. Especially when you consider they have permitted other political parties to use their footage in advertising without voicing the same objection. Even worse, involving two of their reporters was the height of stupidity. As you quite rightly point out, now it places them in an obvious conflict of interest, notwithstanding the perception of bias that already existed. What they’ve effectively accomplished is confirming the bias.

Quite perplexing as the net result will poke the bear and ensure a significant turnout from CPC supporters.

Fred,

IMHO, you don’t solve this case of implicit to explicit bias by denying the CBC journalistic access (or funding). That’s counterproductive at best. It will only harden their biases and those of some viewers.

Oh, undoubtedly, Ronald….but it’s fun to fantasize about it anyway, isn’t it?

(quite similar to what I imagine it’s like to be a hardcore NDP supporter; you know in your heart that your party will never, ever govern Canada, but it’s still fun to ‘pretend’, right?..;)

So Unifor journalists across the media are saying its all the lawyers fault and their idea. Does anyone really believe that CBC lawyers out of the blue, decided on their own to take a political party to court during an election? And why is fiscal responsibility suddenly become a dirty word? Is it normal to live beyond your means?

The CBC likely realizes that they will be troubled financially if the Conservatives win and this may be a defensive position to ferret out conservative bias when they sue the government to maintain their funding.

I’ve listened/watched CBC for decades, but it now has turned into a dreadful broadcaster, certainly not reflecting all areas of the country, a slothful and bias organization

As I’ve said before, the CBC perfectly reflects the values and views of the neighbourhood surrounding its downtown Toronto headquarters. They throw in some Calgary Stampede coverage and the next version of a never-ending line of “Anne of Green Gables” just for regional colour.

Voters who identify themselves as conservative are acutely focused on media bias, particularly as it exists at progressive media organizations like CBC.

True, but the reason they focus on the CBC is because it is publicly funded. Nobody cares that the Toronto Star is biased. I am perfectly fine with Heather Mallick and Martin Regg-Cohn writing their drivel since I don’t have to pay for it (well, before Justin’s $600 million gift). I actually wouldn’t say the CBC is exactly biased against conservatives but more that it simply ignores them completely. The 35-40% of Canadians who lean right of centre simply don’t exist, if one goes by their programming choices.

Well, the suit is about the CPC using a news clip from CBC featuring Barton, without permission. She does not want to be identified as promoting any party. Like Trump usurping Neil Young’s music without permission, for the Cons, it’s rip off first, then worry about the consequences later.

You left this fact out of your write-up. Didn’t fit with the narrative, I guess. Personally, I find Global so pro-Conservative, my toes curl up in annoyance. And I’m not a Lib either.

Do you read the ARC collective on ProgBlog? Because you seem to have been a solid anti-racist in the past. Why does Scheer feature so prominently with white supremacists on that site? Ask yourself that.

It’s funny. It seems only right of centre politicians are expected to take responsibility for every single individual who might support them at any given time for any given reason. Like they’re supposed to enact mind control. If you have evidence that Andrew Scheer is a white supremacist then have at it. Did your parents or kindergarten teacher never tell you the story of the boy who cried wolf?

According to the CPC website, the Copyright Act say that “If a news clip is relatively short and is not a substantial part of the audiovisual work from which it was taken, the broadcast of the news clip in a political ad would not infringe the copyright of the owner of the audiovisual work and would not require the permission of that owner to be broadcast.”
If this is correct, CBC is 100% wrong legally.
I also read that the Liberals used CBC footage in their adds in 2015 and (surprise surprise) no lawsuit.

I notice too that the CBC’s Katie Simpson changed the photo on her twitter account soon as the suit was filed. Previously it showed her, Trudeau, a group of Liberal candidates and a podium with a LPC campaign slogan. I’m wondering if that and some clips that the Libs had used from CBC broadcasts will also show up in the court case. As well as the fact that a number of ex CBC on air staff has ended up either working for Lib ministrys or their consultants.

Bob,

Remember that Harper built over time, especially during the majority, his own building blocks to his government’s political oblivion. If Scheer is actually brain-dead-enough to de-fund the CBC, that will be building-block number one for him. Divesting themselves of the CBC, even to foreign minority interests, is a much more palatable option.

From a CBC article (come and get me CBC!! – dunno the writer anyway): “CBC-Radio Canada named the journalists in the lawsuit, according to the statement, “because their images and journalism were misused for partisan purposes negatively impacting perceptions of their independence.” What kind of la-la land are those two “journalists” living in? One, anyone NOT conservative-ish can’t be shaken at all from believing those two and all at the CBC are objective and un-biased while, two, anyone just slightly right of centre and/or RATIONAL, can’t be convinced come hell or high water anyone at the CBC, or CTV which runs the same stories in basically the same order every nite, is NOT biased against anything that is conservative-ish. Do these guys actually talk to REAL people? Getting to be like the US – a huge flyover country ignored by very, smart, learned elite, angels-on-pinhead arguers.

I’m so sick of CBC’s bias like that ridiculous article yesterday about Andrew Scheer in Winnipeg and people complaining about him not helping out with the storm evacuation. He gave a personal donation, what else was he suppose to do? Stand there looking pretty and taking selfies? I’m actually glad he didn’t pull a Trudeau. We want change, not another pretty boy posing for photo ops. Biased media sources like CBC will go on and on about Scheer’s duel citizenship but carefully sneak around the serious issues such as Justin Trudeau’s ethics violation and appalling treatment of Jody Wilson-Raybould. Never have I seen a politician in Canada get away with so much. If any other political party leader had done the horrifically racist blackface that Trudeau clearly enjoyed engaging in, they would have been forced to resign. By all logic Canadians should be happy for the chance to be rid of JT, but unfortunately there still seems to be too many that are willing to give him a free pass no matter what.

156,Warren Kinsella,Me and Fight Club,2019-10-13 08:47:00,Warren,,"About forty years ago, I stood on a stage in a community hall in Calgary, and looked down at a swirling, tilting mosh pit of punks, slamming into each other, leaping, fighting.

It was chaos. It was anarchy. It was a giant washing machine on its side, grinding away, filled up with sweat and blood and fists. The place was going to detonate at any moment, shooting pieces of building and punk rockers all over Seventeenth Avenue.

My band, the Hot Nasties, played on. I was the lead singer, straddled centre stage, and I looked down at the punks. There were hundreds of them at our sold-out show. We had put up a few posters, but that’s it. In 1978-79, we could draw a thousand punks by word of mouth alone.

I felt this warm wave wash over me, and I realized I was smiling. Later on, I figured out what it was: it was joy. Pure joy.

I had never really been into the anarchy ethos of the punk movement. I was a punk, sure, but I still lived in suburban Calgary with my parents. Extolling anarchy seemed a bit hypocritical, to me.

But at that moment, at that show – as everything was descending into pure, unadulterated chaos – it felt like the world was about to atomize, and fall between the cracks of the floor at the community hall. And I felt exultant. I felt jubilant.

Yes, yes, I know: I’m a lawyer now. I worked for a Prime Minister. I have a house in the County. I’m in my late fifties. I’ve navigated the establishment, and I’ve done okay. I have kids. Yes.

But, as I get older, I find myself orbiting inexorably closer to that teenaged punk that I was. Back to when I had no ideology, no party membership, no governing philosophy. Just a desire to rip everything apart. Rip it to pieces.

Throughout this election campaign, I’ve been asked often why I hate Justin Trudeau. I always say the same thing: “I don’t hate him. If I really hated him, he wouldn’t be still standing. He’s just a liar, and I don’t like liars. All of them, all of the partisans are mostly liars, too.”

Justin Trudeau is Ikea.

So, I have about 42,000 Twitter followers. There’s just one of them, a guy I don’t even know, who gets me. Every time I point my flamethrower at something, he always says the same sort of thing: “The punk.” And I say to him:I don’t even know who the fuck you are, and you know the inside of my grimy, calloused, safety-pinned soul.

Tear it all down, start over again. That – along with anger, and DIY, and anti-racism – is what the punk movement was all about. And punk remains my only ideology, pretty much.

I’d apologize for the long-winded intro, but it’s probably more appropriate to say fuck you if you don’t like it. You didn’t pay to get in here, did you?

What I wanted to say – what I wanted to explain – is my profound love of Fight Club, the movie. It’s twenty years old, as Barry Hertz writes in this column in the Globe. It affected him, I think, like it affected me and a million other misfits and losers and punks.

Fight Club – like Clockwork Orange, Repo Man, The Rock Horror Picture Show and a precious few other movies – was like this documentary about the inside of every punk’s brain. There was some misogyny in there, and some adolescent stupidity, and some other stuff that should’ve been taken out. But, mostly, it was this perfect movie that no one went to see when it came out, twenty years ago. Exceptus.

Slouching in the dark of a movie theatre somewhere, watching everything whirl and twirl and then self-destruct. Gloriously, dramatically, perfectly.

Make no mistake, Conservatives edging ever-closer to power: I’m going to eventually come after you, too, just like I did the Trudeau Cult.

Surrounded as I am in Airstrip One (Broken Brexit Britain) these days by far too many former punks and slackers turned buy to rent landlords, reality TV commissioning editors, City lawyers, branding junkies, members of the European Research Group and other apostate Gen Xers, I confess I can barely remember Fight Club or can only really listen to about half of London Calling now. Opinions differ. One’s response to any item of pop culture that bursts through the consumerist reflex that engulf us all is so often subjective and personal…shaped by one’s life experience and choices rather than any connection to something bigger.. But I digress. I thought David Fincher anticipated the hollowness of our times more accurately in Seven, The Game and Social Network. I grow old, I grow old…to pay the rent I keep my 3 for the price of 2 dress shirts rolled.
Or to paraphrase a famous dead rock star, to be governed by these unelected fascists is so degrading.

Is Gerald Butts an evil genius? Watched Great Leader Justin talk to his loyal Unifor media in Toronto today. They discussed how Scheer’s personal attacks against Justin, and Scheer’s negative campaign is causing threats against Groper. Why even “Greta” may be under threat when she goes to Alberta. Must be Doug Ford’s fault.

Further to your comments, these threats sound a little curious to me. One would assume personal security is always a priority for a prime minister – they don’t talk about it, just take precautions. Any chance Butts is seeking to curry sympathy for his brave leader? Makes for great photo ops and questions from a fawning media. My hunch is a “real deal” security threat would be handled with much more discretion.

Call me dubious here – this supposed threat resulted in way too many pictures of our fearless leader.

As for Scheers campaign, he is using Lib tactics. Taking things that nobody is dumb enough to do but some idiot proposes like Adam Vaughan. Libs tried this whenever someone in the back benches talked about abortion. Now they’re saying this is causing threats. This is why I detest them so much.

The RCMP SNC investigation is ongoing, although suspended as per standard election period operating procedure. As for corruption and OJ, doesn’t that fall within the purview of the DPP? I will give you your point on Norman where prosecutors proceeded on an alleged violation of cabinet confidence. Yes, in that case you’re on target as the charges were totally Trumped-Up. But this is more the fault of prosecutorial decision-making not police forces.

If it was real, then, why was there no door security at the facility? That is now documented, none whatsoever. And,if the threat was real, why wasn’t the event cancelled outright, for security reasons? There was nothing urgent that this meeting couldn’t be cancelled without a problem. The backpacks lead a lot of questions too. There is something about the whole night that doesnt ring true, no wonder the legitimacy of the threat is in serious question, too many inconsistencies. and, not enough media questions. Just silence from the media darlings and Liberal.ca to satisfy if this was real.

I think it’s the blanket of secrecy thrown over the event that leads people to suspect possible Liberal malfeasance.
My biggest question is whether the threat came from the “yellow vest” brigade or the anti-pipeline ( the worldwill end in 10 yrs 2 months) crew. I can see not discussing the specifics of the threat but why wouldn’t we Canadians have a right to know who is threatening our political process?

I’m not sure what to think about this, Ron…other than the fact that it is way, way too conveniently timed.

First of all, those guys with the Walmart backpacks are wearing Ranger insignia which may or may not be real (fonts, shape, etc). Secondly, Canadian Rangers *don’t do* protection of the Prime Minister (that’s the RCMP’s job). Then there are the weird anomalies like no one watching the entrance at all, automatic weapons (supposedly?) inside backpacks where they are all but useless, the unspecified ‘threat’ that no one will talk about during this Liberal-only event prompting the wearing of a bulletproof vest and all this extra security, and yet *the very next day* all threats have seemed to evaporate and JT is once again out in public unprotected and sans vest.

Something is very wrong here. Who are these guys, where are the RCMP and why is nobody acting like there is a serious threat?

Nor would I, but this could have been directed at the regular Liberal voters who are now leaning NDP or Green, couldn’t it?

“It’s simply not logical as a political strategy. Even the Liberal WR isn’t THAT stupid.”

I would have said that over the Robocalls incident (which was not the work of the CPC itself) or the Barbaric Cultural Practices hotline (which was). All of the various party strategists seem to treat the general public as if we are just children, with intellects and attention spans to match.

Warren’s By-Line ‘The Imposter’ says it all. The fake security threat. Theatrics and high-drama all for show. “The brave leader who will not be deterred.” The guy has no shame. He uses the RCMP like Trump uses his Dept. of Justice. Firstly, any other leader would never, within minutes of donning a Kevlar vest, leak it to the media. Theses things tend to be confirmed much later – if at all – when all is said and done. Secondly, if there was a real threat in that enclosed space, why not lock it down and seal the doors? Search and find the source of the threat. It wasn’t like it was in the market square in an uncontrolled site. Even the Keystone Cops would have at least cancelled the event and sent everyone home. Instead the Liberals CHOSE to expose the media and 2000 people to an alleged assassin in their midst! Now, why would they do that? Hmmmm…. maybe Rosemary Barton and the CBC will show video footage of Justin and his Kevlar shirt. And talk about their brave Leader. One imagines Althea Raj and Gerry Butts clinking their glasses. Yeah, and wading into a crowd with his head exposed and vulnerable? Only a person secure in the knowledge of no threat would do that. Otherwise, how does one reconcile doing that whilst willingly exposing others to that same threat? And to have one of his Cabinet Ministers up on the stage, exposed to the threat? Me thinks Gerry and Katie created this and the RCMP do what they’re asked to do. But BFFs Gerry and Justin overplayed their hand. The phalanx of grim-faced special forces shielding Justin while he glad-handed like the fool he is was soooooo Un – Canadian. Apparently the Liberals will do anything to protect us from the Axis of Evil – Harper-Ford-Scheer. It’d be funny if it weren’t so pathetic. I can’t even watch the CBC anymore without thinking it’s become our ‘Fox News’.

I think that’s the position of most Conservatives. I can choose to watch Fox News or I can choose to watch CNN based on my political leanings, and in doing so I financially support whichever one I decide to watch. Not so with the CBC: I am forced to support them with my tax dollars no matter how unfair or biased I find their coverage, and for that reason I demand that they either be as impartial and unbiased as possible or lose their government funding and compete with the private networks on a level playing field.

Liberals, of course, completely disagree with this….and for the obvious reason.

Scheer just finished his conference in Winnipeg and the media were like attack dogs. Most of the questions were how dare you come to Winnipeg when the province is destroyed and people are starving in the streets. And of course Justin fan girl Katie Simpson at the CBC led the charge.

This past weekend I was at a family dinner where all was sweetness and light. Then someone mentioned the election and a young woman blurted out “As long as anybody but Scheer wins!”. I decided this couldn’t go unanswered, but I’ve been through enough of these incidents to know that a soft touch and a sense of humour was needed, and so I challenged her lightly with a smile and with all the obligatory disclaimers (“I’m not a party member, I’m not crazy about Scheer, I like Singh, Bernier is disgusting”, etc.). It didn’t really matter, they all went quiet and squirmy and looked like the drunken uncle was telling his old dirty jokes. I find it all great fun, but it would have killed an American party today. The thing that intrigues me is I suspect they would have had a grand old time arguing about whether Trudeau, Singh or May deserved their votes and still remained good friends and potential lovers. But Scheer and the Cons? That’s the dark side.

I’m retired and old enough not to care much what anyone thinks, but in the workplace or social settings the stakes are higher. So, yes, the syndrome is real and many cons and con-leaners will just keep quiet and put on, in the words or Gilbert and Sullivan, “a smile so bland”. It’s no accident that we are starting to see more and more articles from progressive Americans questioning whether democracy is such a great idea after all.

I can remember a time when people were able to have civilized discussions, actually exchange ideas and listen to viewpoints other than their own. However, the political atmosphere has become increasingly toxic in the past few years so that people not only disagree with your viewpoint but also think you’re a horrible person for having that viewpoint. The only reasonable response to that outburst at the dinner table would be ”Could you please pass the potatoes?”

I do notice that in a lot of social interactions this campaign, to the extent that anyone blurts out an actual opinion or preference, that “anybody but Scheer” thing is the most likely sentiment to be expressed. That said, I’m in Vancouver. I’m sure it’s different in Calgary (I was there last month and it was a sea of blue signs).

That “shy Tory” thing does exist, but it gets overstated by some right-leaning people. For example, Trump supporters down south use it as an excuse to diss any poll result they don’t like. Polling has its challenges these days, but polls by and large are still fairly accurate. And people mischaracterize what polls are and what they’re supposed to be. They’re not meant to be modern-era crystal balls.

Yep. If you want to get even more enraged, take a look at CBC’s online stories. Political lobbying disguised as “person on the street” discussions.

If you target the people on the street that you know will support your viewpoint, it’s easy to concoct a particular narrative.

My favorite is the recent story, here in Manitoba, that the most pressing issues for Manitobans were indigenous issues, immigration, and agriculture. They came up with this list by… (wait for it…) talking to an indigenous activist, an immigration consultant, and a farmer. Now that is crack journalism!

Hey Warren,

Here’s an article I think you’d enjoy. Dealing with the band who released a track titled “Don’t Worry About The Government”, it deals with many of the weird sub-texts that have lead us to our current bi-polarized narcissism. It’s written by someone who can actually write songs, and write articles . . . kinda “Silence of the Lambs” meets “Psycho Killer”

So Groper’s Toronto Star is excited that their hero Justin said he would finance the proposed Ontario line that Doug Ford wants in Toronto. Nothing to do with the election of course. And just ignore that Trudeau was giving Ford a hard time about financing projects in Ontario, including the Ontario line before the election. Remember the rants about not getting proper applications?

To be clear for your readers outside TO, the Libs are actually supporting Toronto city council in whatever decision it made, which was to maintain the status quo re ownership and operation of subway lines (ie not uploaded to the province) in a new deal. Since the City has agreed to go with Ford’s version of the DRL* (now longer by a several km and called the Ontario Line) in return for maintaining this control, the Libs are technically agreeing to fund Ford’s redesign of the project. You are technically correct but this doesn’t bode well for future cooperation on other Ont/Fed issues.

150,Warren Kinsella,Why I can’t vote for Trudeau,2019-10-16 08:09:00,Warren,,"I was Jean Chretien’s special assistant. I helped oversee his war room when he won in 1993 and 2000. I ran for the Liberals in B.C. in 1997.

And I can’t vote Liberal. I won’t. And I don’t think you should either.

Here’s why.

People vote for (or against) politicians for different reasons. In 2015, they voted for Justin Trudeau because he wasn’t Stephen Harper, who they’d grown tired of.

They voted for Trudeau because he was fresh and new and charismatic. Because he had his father’s surname. Because we (me especially) thought he’d be different.

They voted for him because he promised ethical and accountable government. They voted for him because he promised electoral reform, and balanced budgets, and harmonious relations with First Nations and the provinces and the world.

And now, many Canadians are voting against him because he didn’t do any of those things. He did the exact reverse.

He lied about balanced budgets and electoral reform. He didn’t deliver on harmony with other levels of government: First Nations and the provinces, and important international players — like China and the U.S. and India — think he’s a child.

And ethics? That didn’t work out so well, either. He’s the first sitting prime minister to have been found guilty of breaking ethics laws — in the Aga Khan and Lavscam scandals. In the latter case, the RCMP have said they are now reviewing the conduct of Trudeau’s government “carefully.” Some people may go to jail.

But for this writer — who happily voted for Liberal Nate Erskine-Smith in the Toronto Beach riding in 2015 — I can’t vote again for the Trudeau Party, which bears no resemblance to the Liberal Party of John Turner and Jean Chretien and Paul Martin. I can’t vote for it because it isn’t a political party.

It’s a cult.

It bears all the hallmarks of a cult. Slavish and unquestioning devotion to the leader. The willingness to punish and isolate critics and outsiders.

The fundamental belief that they are everything — in Trudeau’s case, that the Liberal Party is Canada, and vice versa. If you are against them, you are literally against Canada. That’s what they think.

Along with running some campaigns (winning and losing), I’ve written books about politics. Along the way, I’ve learned that people vote based on emotion, not reason.

In my case, my reasons for objecting to the Trudeau cult are deeply personal and real. I have written about, and opposed, racism for more than three decades. I am also a proud father of an indigenous girl.

How can I look my daughter in the eye and say I voted Liberal, after what Trudeau did to the female indigenous hero named Jody Wilson-Raybould? After he attacked her and exiled her for telling the truth? For saying no to a group of grasping men? For standing up for the rule of law?

I can’t do that.

How, too, can I vote for a man-boy who donned racist blackface — not once, not twice, but at least three times that we know about — and still say I fight racism? How can I claim to be against bigotry when I legitimize the bigotry of a clueless, overprivileged brat with my vote?

Politicians like to say that elections are about choices, because they are. They also are choices that are highly emotional and highly personal. Emotionally, personally, rationally, I cannot bring myself to vote for this loathsome cult.

And, with the greatest respect, I don’t know how you could either","<div class=""articlecontent"">

I tried to watch all of Groper’s speech and question and answer session in Quebec today. He ranted how Scheer is running a negative and divisive campaign. This while he answered every question with, Harper, Ford, and Jason Kenney. He asked people in Quebec to join him in the fight against Conservative premiers. Nothing divisive about that I guess. He also added the premier of New Brunswick to his list of evil people. Did Gerald Butts hand out the questions to the Unifor media present. Questions like, how do you feel about the Manning Institute not releasing the names of their donors. No questions about Justin’s fund raiser in New York. Or the question how do you feel about Ford coming out of hiding from you and speaking in Kenora today. Our Unifor media at work.

Scheer seems to think he is a liability since he hasn’t uttered Ford’s name for the whole campaign.

Scheer was on record a few days ago saying Doug Ford is too busy fixing the Liberal fiscal mess in Ontario to campaign for him.
And, besides I think its a huge mistake that conservatives are not associating themselves with Doug Ford. He is not as scary to Conservatives as he is to Dippers and Liberals. If I were Scheer I would have him at my hip every time I entered the province.
How has that kicking your leaders in the ass worked for the NDP? I HAVE BEEN PRIME MINISTER AS OFTEN AS ALL NDP LEADERS COMBINED.

– Has a friend and former teaching buddy from way back when that got busted for child porn. Pig.
– Stifles the press with court injunctions to suppress stories of alleged sexual impropriety y him and his child porn watching friend, with a female student resulting in his banishment from teaching. Elitist Pig.
-Purchases the press by covertly supplying print media with 1.2B of our tax dollars to create a propaganda media model that is only rivaled by PRAVDA. Shameless Pig.
– Suppresses right leaning media by refusing them access to the government to ask questions (Love or hate the media outlets in question; they have a right to report.) Prejudiced Pig. (In fairness, Jagmeet Singh has refused to address their questions also, making him too prejudicial to get my vote.)

Finally, the Obama endorsement today stinks to high Heaven. Much like Johnny Crouton getting the Clinton Photo Op at the WH years ago that helped seal an election win; this smacks of such hypocrisy not only of Trudeau but particularly Obama… What a race baiting, joke both men have become… But Trudeau, unlike Obama is truly, truly, truly; the stupidest PM in the history of our nation.

You may not trust Andrew Scheer and if that is the case review your local Green, NDP, independent and vote for the best person.
NO Liberal candidate I have read about is immune from supporting the dear leader. They are ALL cultist. Doesn’t mean they aren’t good people but they are clearly indoctrinated.

Imagine a re-elected Trudeau shows up at a gathering of foreign leaders.

As Justin starts his speech, including parts about human rights and the environment, the other leaders remove their simultaneous translation war pieces. One or two walk out. Butts and Telford are aghast.

Finally one of the leaders interrupts. “That will be all Mr . lying, unethical, blackface, two jet, hypocrite.”

Justin Trudeau, the best the Liberals have to offer: liar, unethical, vindictive, entitled, hypocrite. And many Liberals are ok with this.

If he’s re-elected how will Canadians be regarded when they travel overseas?

I keep seeing ignorant liberal partisans calling conservatives and even NDP supporters racist. Talk about the pot calling the kettle “blackface.” In all seriousness, it’s sick how these extremist liberals refuse to acknowledge the harm that Justin has done with his blackface and just simply dismiss it as a non-issue. My friends and family members both in Canada and abroad have expressed hurt and disgust at the seemingly free pass Justin Trudeau is getting, and that they will never look at Canadians the same way again if he remains the PM after October 21st, even with a minority government. This isn’t the first time Justin has humiliated Canada internationally, but it’s definitely one of the worst instances. No one I know is voting for Trudeau, even the ones who supported him last time. They have all been open with their contempt for him which I consider unusual since they never have gotten this riled up over politics before.

Although I’m liberal in both heart and mind, there is no way I’ll even consider voting red until this moron is out. Even then there needs to be far more scrutiny when it comes to selecting liberal party leaders because all of them have been losers after Paul Martin, (before I was old enough to vote), and that includes Trudeau despite his last win. Do better, liberals! I know you can.

I’d go back a little further than Paul Martin for my liar od the non-loser liberal leader.
Paul Martin Jr. was the right man in the wrong party at the worst time.
He was far more a conservative than what was left of the party he inherited from the Trudeau/Chretien gang.
He was a loser because he couldn’t win a majority and couldn’t keep a minority together.
He and John Turner were both admirable men the kind of Liberal I was. But, they were shitty choices or sacrificial lambs for the Liberals. Neither had a clue how to campaign and failed terribly in establishing themselves when taking power with authority from their predecessor.
Chretien was a winner, Trudeau vs 1.0 was a winner but Paul Martin was the start of this slide because he couldn’t bring the Liberals back to middle ground while his chief opponents beat his ass on both the left and right flank.

Scheer’s friendship with white nationalist trash Faith Goldy shouldn’t surprise anyone considering who he hired to run his campaign. Campaign Director, Hamish Marshall – co-founded alt-right site “The Rebel”, published anti-Semitic Holocaust rant, sympathized with white supremacists at Charlottesville.
Outreach Director, Georganne Burke – help founded an anti-Islam group and continues to participate online, supports Trump.
Digital Director, Stephen Taylor – linked to an alt-right subreddit, created HarperPAC to get Harper re-elected and “stick it to the unions.”

Mike Roman, Trump’s former Director of Special Projects and Research, is working on Scheer’s campaign. Scheer doesn’t want to talk about it. Georganne Burke, another Trump supporter, is in Scheer’s inner circle. He doesn’t want to talk about her either.
Roman also ran an opposition research unit for that according to Politico, conducted “surveillance and intelligence gathering on its liberal opponents.”
Roman spoke at an event in April titled “litigation as a tool”, sharing advice on how energy companies can silence environmental critics through frivolous lawsuits.
Ironically, it appears that it is the Conservatives themselves who are opening the door to foreign actors — including Trump officials — to provide advice on how to influence Canadian politics.

So, Scheer is likely to go gonzo-right in policy terms and that, of course, will be his ultimate undoing in 2023. (But hey, that’s not my problem. It’s Hamish’s.)

Sorry, but this is just “hidden agenda” recycling. Harper didn’t go “rabid-right-wing”. At worst, the hotline was a dumb decision but he was center-left to center-right the whole time he was in power. It was the only way to run the minority government he had, and he didn’t change that much until some silly pandering at the last election which he didn’t win.

Because Justin was the shiny new thing. Harper was PM for 10 years! That’s an astonishing accomplishment for anyone, let alone a former reform MP. Harper didn’t go out in a blaze of scandal like Cretien or Mulroney or hopefully JT. He was one of the good guys whether the rabid left like it or not.

Nonsense. Scheer is middle of the road, nothing more. He’s made a deal with the devil with the Qbec cheese cartel. Why do you think the PPC and Bernier exist? While Bernier is the economic rightist, Canadian conservatives are similar to 1970s US Democrats. Anything else is just leftist mass hysteria, similar to Extinction rebellion and Scoldilocks nonsense, ala Lizard May

It’s okay Shane, have a flavoured organic ethically produced half-decaf java and relax. Maybe take a breath because when you speak before you think you forget to mention dear leader Justin Trudeau has had a drink or two with Faith Goldy. I know you would want to be fair and balanced in your assessment.
I am just telling you this so you don’t have an aneurism or stroke as you do your daily exhaltation to your bosses. It’s hard not being a hyprocite when the dear leader tells you what to say.
No one was ever ben sent to hell for being a conservative. There are two reasons, first there is nothing saying that being conservative in itself is un-Canadian let alone sinful and secondly the Trudeau team of misfits don’t get to make those sort of choices.

I’ve been voting for 30+ years and I have never had reason to question the integrity of people who voted differently than I did. We live in a society where reasonable people can disagree. However this time around, I’m having difficulty granting people the benefit of the doubt, as it were, when they put Liberal signs in their yard. It’s come to the point where such an action amounts to a public declaration of unseriousness as a person.

As much as I try to look upon these actions with a degree of charity , I can only conclude that the erection of a Liberal sign is tantamount to notifying your neighbours that you have neither dignity nor self-respect.

My first reaction was exactly like yours but I disagree now after some thought and digestion of the news headline.
I think it was a bit of clever campaigning that was pretty decent in saying that “hey, you don’t have to dump your NDP choice and vote liberal to oppose a conservative minority”.

In fact I think it will be pretty hard for anyone to pan a tory win immediately, if they have a plurality, the Liberals themselves may decide to support the government for a time, probably through their first convention after this mess is over. Singh may want to use that time to be the true “effective” opposition (I miss Ed Broadbent) to better position themselves for the rematch that will come.
I think the optics were a little inconsistent on SATURDAY but Singh since has been eating Trudeau’s lunch on the usual Liberal pander to the left ploy.
This time the Left may stay in their home fold and the Liberals can spend some time figuring out who they are. After the Orange wave they somehow determined this fraud was a better idea than a rebuild now it may still prove to have been a mistake.
Understand, I personally feel the NDP is the communist choice. A little harsh to some but I call em as I see em. What I am saying is that the NDP are not as afraid of the Liberals campaigning to the left and governing to the right because they see the fraudster Trudeau for what he really is.

A political party is a Gestalt whole and cannot be reduced to constituent parts. Not all Liberals are lackluster. Chretien, Turner, & Martin will all be voting Liberal without a doubt. Moreover, it is understandable why a parent of an aboriginal would be so overtly contemptuous of a contrived façade of sincerity espoused by the marketing board of the Liberal War Room.

I get the contempt for Trudeau at al. but my contempt for Steven Harper is still salient.

I’ve known since I was a young child that I leaned Libertarian and could never support the Liberal or NDP parties. Not surprising given that I’m the descendant of prairie homesteaders and mostly grew up in Calgary. That being said, the current Liberal government is particularly offensive and malevolent:-leader who has never accomplished anything beyond being famous for being famous. At least Kim Kardashian sort of worked for her fame by making a sex tape
-phony wokebot leader who rattles off meaningless, out of context soundbites. All politicians sort of do this but Trudeau has a limited set of responses mostly about promoting the middle class, fighting Doug Ford and scaremongering about Stephen Harper
-wizard behind the curtain who supposedly resigned but still pulls the strings
-tried to save face on sabotaging the investment climate by buying a pipeline
-attempted to let a sleazy Quebec based engineering company continue to bid on government contracts even though Canadian prohibits it
-ended the career of a high ranking military official in an attempt to steer government contracts towards a rich, Liberal friendly company
-resurrected Quebec and Alberta nationalism by playing regions against one another
-incurred billions in debt with nothing tangible to show during a period that will likely turn out to be the high water mark of the current business cycle

I respect your opinion Warren but climate change is more important than all of those issues, as important as they are, and while people will wave their hands and say the Libs plan is insufficient, most environmental analysis I’ve read indicates it is substantially better than that and definitely better than the conservative non-plan. So we are stuck choosing between the least of two evils.

Climate Change is a Trillion dollar industry.
That is why ethics and morals in a government are so important because there is a lot of money to be made for a corrupt government and their friends.

On Climate – it’s basically Harper who basically keeps GHG emissions constant, or Trudeau, who basically keeps GHG emissions constant. Both actually reduce GHG per capita, but let in enough people to offset the savings. If you really want to reduce GHG produced by Canada (and ignore those produced by the rest of the world), then Green or NDP is the only choice.

I read that story from the Huffington post via CTV, and was awed at how skillfully they managed to avoid mentioning the background details.

For example, the fact that the previous Conservative government proposed to do the exact same thing until they were alerted to the reality that 75% of Canadians opposed the change. They backed off.

Then along comes Our Savior, who proposes the same action. A poll is taken…the same 75% of the public still oppose the change. He DOES IT ANYWAY.

IMHO, what Scheer has to ask himself in a minority context is whether he’ll be facing Mackenzie King or Martin? He undoubtedly prefers the latter but is more likely to get the former. In short, he’s got to win it big.

One line that stuck with me through the folloing decades is this: “Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action.”

Yesterday, Barack Obama “endorsed” Trudeau. Coincidentally, not to mention concurrently, so did Bruce Heyman, Obama’s appointment as Ambassador to Canada. Later, Trudeau declines to ask if he solicited the endorsement(s).

Perhaps to state the obvious, Trudeau doesn’t have signs saying he “stands up” for other provinces because he doesn’t stand up for other provinces. In fact, in some cases, he actively does things to hurt them.

Then again, most other provinces aren’t populated by the sorts of citizens that have been spoon-fed and pandered-to their entire lives, as has been the case in Quebec since the 1980s. And it isn’t even really their fault; when you create a system that continually tells a group of people they are special (or hard-done-by), inevitably they will come to believe it and demand that it continues and grows.

This kills TMX dead & puts resource industry in death throes, Kenney has to give in to pressure to hold a referendum on staying in confederation before his term is up.

Rest assured, the people of Alberta are okay with this. At the very least expect to see a firewall going up around AB and likely SK, perhaps MB. And a referendum on equalization fast tracked.

Oscoe,

I don’t think that it won’t but point is what does an equalization referendum solve? Sure, it’s great show and tell (a Kenney and Trudeau specialty) but Kenney can’t do diddly alone to get it modified. It’s high time that it got modified, but that’ll happen only in our dreams. That’s when Kenney’s crunch time will come: to see if he has the actual balls to hold a REAL separation referendum and pending results, walk if necessary. Then we’ll really see what Kenney is made of, or not.

147,Warren Kinsella,"My latest: Trump trumps Trudeau, and why",2019-10-17 09:36:00,Warren,,"Justin Trudeau is less popular than Donald Trump.

Say it aloud, so that those still considering voting for Trudeau can hear you.

Because, you know, Donald Trump. The most sexist, most racist, most dishonest US president is more highly regarded than the Canadian Prime Minister. That’s hard to do, but Justin Trudeau has done it.

As far back as March, Trump was doing better than Trudeau. In that month, Ipsos found Trump’s approval rating was 43 per cent. Trudeau’s was 40.

In August, it got even worse. Zogby Analytics revealed that Trump had an approval rating of 51 per cent. Trudeau was “underwater,” Zogby reported, at 43 per cent.

And Toronto Sun pollster John Wright, of DART, has analyzed the data, and come up with the same conclusion as the others. “Trudeau’s personal approval numbers are below Trump’s,” says Wright. “So more selfies won’t help.”

And therein lies the rub. Wright has put his finger on the zeitgeist: this election isn’t remotely about issues. It’s a referendum on Justin Trudeau. And he’s been losing it.

What went wrong? How is Justin Trudeau – once the darling of international media, the beneficiary of Trudeaumania II, and the guy who propelled his party from a Parliamentary third place to first – now facing what HuffPo’s Althia Raj, no less, has declared the “possibility he won’t be Prime Minister much longer.” How did that happen?

Three reasons. The first: he over-promised and under-delivered.

Trudeau did that a lot. On electoral reform, on balanced budgets, on ethical reform, on being the feminist champion and the Indigenous reconciler: in every case, he promised the Earth but delivered only dust.

Trudeau’s true legacy is seen in the LavScam scandal, where he obliterated his credentials as the ethical paragon and liberator of women and Indigenous peoples. There, he cravenly tried to rescue a Quebec-based Liberal Party donor facing a corruption trial – and, along the way, revealed himself more than willing to brutalize two women, one Indigenous, who bravely stood up for the Rule of Law.

Second reason: he thinks he’s far more charming and entertaining than he actually is.

Some time ago, a member of Trudeau’s insular inner circle told this writer that one of their biggest problems was Trudeau’s unshakeable belief that he is funny. “He thinks he’s a comedian,” said this man. “He isn’t.”

Thus, making blackface his go-to party favour. Thus, his puerile penchant for dress-up, even when it humiliates Canadians, as in the infamous Griswolds-style Indian vacation. Thus, his utterly bizarre penchant for making jokes – remember “peoplekind?” – that aren’t merely jokes. They’re jokes that render him one.

Recently, this writer was told by a very senior Grit that Trudeau referred to NDP leader Jagmeet Singh as “Marge Simpson” – presumably a reference to Singh’s turban. (A Liberal campaign spokesman declined to comment about the allegation; an NDP war room member said they were aware of the “joke.”)

Why, why would Trudeau say such a thing? “Because he thought it was funny,” said this Parliamentarian.

The third and final reason that Justin Trudeau is less popular than Donald Trump is neatly, and expertly, mirrored in the Conservative Party’s shrewd attack ad slogan:“Justin Trudeau. Not as advertised.”

That pithy catchphrase, more than anything else, is why Trudeau is plumbing the polling depths, even more than Trump. Canadians have grown to believe that the former drama teacher is, indeed, just an actor.

Donald Trump, as detestable as he is to so many, is at least truthful about who he is. He doesn’t hide it.

Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, wears blackface to parties.

Warren, there is a very real possibility of the Liberals losing the popular vote to the Conservatives but winning the seat count given their greater vote efficiency (in particular, it helps the Libs that Atlantic Canada has more seats than Sask/Man combined despite having fewer people). In fact I would go so far as to say it is the likeliest outcome. An extra f-you to all those who voted Liberal in 2015 to bring about electoral reform precisely to avoid such a scenario, really digging in that knife.

“The party that receives the most seats on Oct. 19 should get the first opportunity to govern, Trudeau said.”

Blackie McBlackface yesterday was giving his standard rants in Quebec about Harper! Harper! Jason Kenney, Doug Ford! And it seems the Liberals can’t stay out of the new for the wrong reasons. The Globe and Mail reports this morning that documents show that after the second Boeing crash they still didn’t think it was a high priority. And story on a Liberal MP in trouble over a pot startup.

I think I figured out why Trudeau keeps referring to Harper. Remember he said that he doesn’t read newspapers because he figures that if something important happens, someone will tell him? Obviously someone forgot to tell him that Harper is no longer the CPC leader.

Montréalaise,

I would put it to you this way: Scheer ain’t scary enough to do the damage Liberals need to get re-elected. Strategically, they’ve got a pile of nothing that works effectively against Scheer. That’s why they are positively desperate to have Canadians tune in to the Harper Channel. But it won’t work cause Canadians are more royally sick of Trudeau than scared of private citizen Harper. In short, they’re fucked and they know it. But what else can they do?

Is Justin fan girl Katie Simpson at the CBC getting paid by Blackie McBlackface? Scheer just finished his speech and she right away got into a big fight with him, accusing him of spreading misinformation about Groper and Adam Vaughn.

Apparently Scheer said a Liberal-NDP government would increase the GST to 7.5% or eliminate the Social Transfer to the provinces. Sounds like spreading misinformation to me.

“Sounds like spreading misinformation to me.”

Yeah, just like the Liberal ads accusing the CPC of planning to restrict abortion, or those hilarious NDP ads attacking Elizabeth May for also not defending ” a woman’s right to choose”.

Yes, all parties have done it and should be called on it.

Only the Conservatives have made misinformation about the carbon tax a centre piece of thier campaign.

Its a good thing we have Americans to tell us stupid Canadians how to vote. The media is excited that Martin Luther King III is in Toronto, where he urged people to vote for Justin and the Liberals. I’m sure Martin Luther King would have loved to have Justin in blackface march with him in the 60s.

144,Warren Kinsella,Statement,2019-10-19 16:55:00,Warren,,"It’s been quite a day.

So, a few things.

After a decade or more, I’ve deactivated Twitter and Facebook. I’ve had it. I may be back on social media, I may not. I don’t know.

I’m pulling back from other media, too. My family and my work colleagues don’t deserve what they’ve been going through. One of them even had to change her cell number today, it got so bad. Also, I’m sick. So, enough is enough.

I’m a lawyer; I’m not interested in getting disbarred. As Jody Wilson-Raybould knows too well, lawyers are not permitted to simply break vows of confidentiality. Only the client can let you do that. The client, here, hasn’t.

I’ve been researching, writing about, and opposing racism for more than three decades. Maxime Bernier and his People’s Party are indisputably racist. They are bigots. They have anti-Semitic and homophobic members. If someone wants to join forces with me to beat Bernier, I will always welcome it.

I’m proud to oppose bigots like Bernier, paid or not. And the client who wanted to expose and oppose bigotry? They deserve credit, not criticism.

The work we were doing ended many months ago. It was always going to be disclosed, by law. It was in no way inappropriate or wrong. Opposing organized bigotry is always appropriate and right. We were and are fiercely proud of the work we did.

We hired someone. That person made anti-Semitic, intolerant remarks and stole from our company. We got rid of that person. It doesn’t surprise me, in the slightest, that person would do something that would later assist Bernier’s intolerant political party. It’s what a hater would do.

All the journalists calling and texting: I get it. You have a job to do, and it’s the final weekend. But I’m just not going to respond anymore. So stop trying. Sorry.

Finally: I hold no party membership with anyone. I regard myself as an independent. As a firm, we have worked for every single political party – or candidates running under the banner of every single political party. Every one, except Bernier’s. We don’t help racists.

Any of you who are depicting Maxime Bernier as in any way a victim are assisting a racist. You are helping him. You should stop doing that.

That’s all I’ve got to say. (I had originally kept comments open, below, but I had too many people inviting me to kill myself. So comments are turned off.)

The picture above? It’s of my favourite places on Earth. It’s where you’ll find me.

So, what does this mean for the SNC Laval affair? The RCMP is supposed to resume looking into that again, aren’t they? With a minority, the LPC will have a more difficult time covering it up, I would think.

To those Trudeau supporters (and dare I say enablers) who worked so diligently towards this outcome, enjoy it for what it is.
As you celebrate, realize that you have given tantamount support for the Canadian version of the man whom a great many claim to revile in the country to our south.
-A barely closeted racist, with a penchant for treating women as objects of his amusement in his quest retain power.
– Someone who will use any procedural loophole to prevent any investigation into his machinations.

Without any knights in shining armour, we have to make choices. Multiple long term conservative voters I associate with voted liberal or green because of that issue.
Next time the Tories should consider that issue as one they can’t smirk about. And if they want to draw a contrast with a sneaky, dishonest leader, they could make sure their own guy’s secrets are out first.

Sorry, but before you slam every Trudeau voter, this Con supporter, who likes Scheer, didn’t come across any friends or family who had much confidence in him. All I heard was wariness and suspicion. It’s unfortunate because I believe he is a decent guy, but there clearly weren’t enough of me, and politics is brutal. I think it was a mistake to go toe-to-toe with JT over leadership and keep his team in the shadows. As I said in an earlier thread, bad boys get more dates than bland boys.
Plus I don’t recall one gripping idea he ran on–certainly nothing that got hearts beating in the major cities. I’m appalled the country chose such a feckless PM, but I think I’ll look to the Cons to account for it before giving up on the country.

This won’t wash for Scheer, as he was expected to win government, but they can at least say that Singh helped limit the Liberals to a minority and that would be exact.

139,Warren Kinsella,Who lost,2019-10-22 07:55:00,Warren,,"Well, everyone did, pretty much. This morning, it’s hard not to feel that way.

•Justin Trudeau was supposed to easily win a second majority. He didn’t. Blackface, broken promises and scandal – LavScam and Aga Khan, to name just two – have sullied his name, and reduced him to a minority.

• Andrew Scheer was running against a Liberal leader less popular than Donald Trump – a Liberal leader who was even hit with a massive scandal mid-campaign – and he still couldn’t win. The talking points about popular vote are sophistry – most of that vote came from the prairies, where it didn’t result in enough seats to win￼. We all knew he wanted to get rid of Trudeau – but we didn’t know what he’d do if he won.

• Jagmeet Singh was supposed to be the Jag-ernaut, the one everyone would turn to. But it didn’t work out that way. He lost Quebec seats and was shut out of places like Toronto, where he needed to win. His response to Trudeau’s blackface scandal was pitch-perfect – but he couldn’t translate that into a big victory.

• Elizabeth May lost, big. After multiple elections, after multiple tries, all she could do is add a single seat. As with Trudeau and Trump, it’s always dangerous to let your political party morph into a single person. She needs to go. And her party wants her to move on, too.

• Maxime Bernier is done, as my friend Brian Topp put it on TV last night. ￼He’s done. And good riddance. Me and my firm were honoured to campaign against Bernier, who made common cause with racists, anti-Semites and white supremacists. His loss, his humiliation, was complete. May we never see his likes again.

• The West, my home, is again relegated to margins, as it was during the reign of Trudeau’s father. Trudeau didn’t seem to care about Alberta’s plight before, and he’ll care even less, now. Anger is rising in the West. There will be consequences.

• Unity, which wasn’t even on the ballot, lost. The separatists are back – visibly, in Quebec, less so in the West (for now) – and they intend to hold the future for ransom. The word “constitution” was used by the Bloc leader last night. Get ready to hear it many more times, in the weeks ahead.

• Canada lost. As in 1980, as with another Trudeau, Canada is deeply, deeply divided – with the West feeling powerless, and the East completely indifferent to that. We often claim to be better than America, but we’re like America, now – a nation divided, a nation moving apart.

Not very sunny ways, I know. And a (typical) overstatement, maybe. There are glimmers of hope in the detritus: Jody Wilson-Raybould’s huge win, Jane Philpott’s extraordinary dignity, the pollsters were finally right, the complete rejection of racist populism. But that’s about all I can see, on this rainy and cold morning.

I’m not sure where all of us are headed.

I watched Global’s coverage last evening. Dawna Freizen & the panel were very vocal about how Trudeau cut off Scheer’s speech after he just started.

I’m glad Trudeau isn’t in a majority, but this situation isn’t ideal either.
Global News said Trudeau’s speech sounded like he wrote it thinking he was going to win. After he was finished, they did replay Scheer’s speech.

How things will play out will be interesting none the less.

I feel bad for our fellow Canadians to the West though. I wonder if some of us in the East don’t realize how bad things have got for them in Alberta & Saskatchewan.

I wouldn’t want them to leave but if that is what is best for them, then I would support them.

No, no leaving is falling into the hands of the left! Leaving and becoming land locked would be crazy. They would never get any pipes built.
No, the only option for Jason is to organize another federal party ala Bloc! Like, a ‘The West Party’ consisting of only Alberta, Sask., & Man. who together could vote in 60+ MPs to stand for those western provinces in the same way as the Bloc for Quebec. There is no other option!

All options would be open to Alberta.

They could go alone.
They could join with Saskachewan and some other Western provinces.
In both these scenarios, there would likely be heavy duties placed on Canadian good passing through Alberta.

If it doesn’t work out, joining USA is also an option.
Also, potentially Rest-of-Canada would realize their mistake and welcome Alberta back.

Pedant says:

Going it alone is not a realistic option for a landlocked province. But joining the USA is a viable option. Alberta’s tax bill would plummet overnight. Washington would be gaining what would be one of the wealthiest states per capita and a young highly skilled population. Pipelines can be easily built through Montana, mixing Alberta’s heavy crude with the light crude generated by the shale industry. Strategically it would cement Washington’s push for energy independence and leave Canada with even less leverage in trade negotiations. I don’t see any benefit to Alberta staying in the Canadian federation from a purely transactional perspective. There is patriotic sentiment of course, but Trudeau has declared that Canada is a post-nation country with no core identity. Why would Albertans get misty-eyed over such a milquetoast, rootless place?

I encourage people here who talk western separation to contribute to the PQ party and the Bloc in Quebec if that’s their goal. They have the only real chance at breaking up the country.

I live in rural British Columbia, about an hour-and-a-half outside of Vancouver. My 14-year-old son came home from school this afternoon and the first thing he said was, “Wexit: bring it on!”

Apparently that was the dominant political discussion at his school today following last night’s result.

This doesn’t bode well for Canada.

Trudeau had better grow a big set and be decisive about what he wants. If he wants the pipeline, then make it happen. If he doesn’t, shut it down. And then deal with the consequences either way.

We’re in for serious turbulence, no matter what he does. The country feels like it is at a crossroads right now.

First off, this government will pass. Hopefully soon but someday I believe the country will survive.

I think Alberta’s exit from the federation would be a disaster. But there are better ways. Western alienation is real and it is not exclusive to Alberta.

British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba all are more conservative as a whole than anything else. Don’t forget northern Ontario’s resentment of Toronto.

Forget a new western party it already exists. It’s called the Conservative party if Canada. That tool needs to be strengthened. But how? Reform, the old progressive party, western members of CCF all are evidence that the west cannot affect change the way the Bloc can for Quebec. If your base is solid and can’t crack the seats of power than it is over after election 44 and you look at those alternatives after fighting a hell of a fight.

First I think you stick with Andrew Scheer. The last thing you need is a new leader in a fractious parliament. He’s a voice of reason and he’s done a decent job of purging radicals. He has a leg up on experience in a campaign. He needs a strong mandate early. If you must select a new leader do it right now. Time is critical no time to get the new guy installed and up to speed. Those who are potential leaders need a seat in parliament the day they are chosen. Peter MacKay, Rona Ambrose, Lisa Raitt and others need to seek nomination in a coming election and be team players support the leader through a writ before you seek the throne.

Second stop playing into left wing traps like the gang-rape that we call debates. Canadians deserve to hear the only two legitimate candidates standing toe to toe without distractions. If you can’t than stay away. It didn’t hurt Trudeau to avoid the debates that he could not win. Don’t refer to the NDP and Bloc as anything but a fringe party. You aren’t trying to win their support. Conservatives only opponent is the Liberals focusing any sound bites on others distracts naive voters. The Conservatives have never lost to anyone but the Liberals this is about winning. Winners don’t worry about the third place opponent that will support anyone but you go after Liberals only.

Third the provincial parties and federal parties must unite. Correct me if I’m wrong. The only Liberal party not formally linked to the feds is the one in BC. Alberta and Ontario and the other progressive conservatives need to brand themselves as brothers and sisters who defend each other as siblings would. The Saskatchewan and BC Liberal party is a little tougher. In time….

Finally define yourself first. Abortion will always be a weapon unless every candidate signs off on any changes to abortion laws. They do that -admit the debate is over and accept that as lost. You wouldn’t reverse gay marriage why expose yourselves to the risk? Those who don’t agree? Leave. Defining yourself means campaigning early having all nominees vetted and or appointed early there will be another election sooner than later. As the old Calvary adage goes get there firstest with the mostest.

If you look like a national governing alternative you can turn Ontario and Quebec. If you have a few MacKay types in the east and You surround the cities of Montreal and Toronto in a blue siege. You have a shot at being a party from the west seen as for all the rest.

Trudeau will be as arrogant as ever and his disdain for the West even stronger. Eastern Canada just gave him the thumbs up. The East is obviously ok with corruption, racism, misogyny, sexual improprieties and hypocrisy in leadership. The West won’t separate but this will be a country that hates each other. What a wonderful place to live.

For Christ’s sake, even in rural Alberta– even in remaining outport NFLD– in fact, whether economically down or not, everywhere in this country but some indigenous communities (* see below), we have a ridiculously high standard of living/convenience/health care compared to the VAST majority of humanity alive on this planet. I’m sure parts of Belgium and Norway have depressed economies too, but we’re in a select club of those who have it good. It’s not libertarian economic utopia here and it’s not socialist free-everything-for-everybody utopia either. It has countless disappointments but if you can’t see how cushy we have it you are being stubbornly blind on purpose.

137,Warren Kinsella,Did Doug Ford sink Andrew Scheer,2019-10-23 07:36:00,Warren,,"Elections produce mythologies and stupidities. An example of a stupidity is that opposition research firms – like, say, mine – don’t actually do opposition research.

An example of a mythology is that Trudeau, Scheer, Singh and May won. They didn’t. They all lost what they most wanted: Trudeau, a majority. Scheer, power. Singh, more seats. May, way more seats.

Another mythology that came out of this nasty, brutish and not-nearly-short-enough election: that Doug Ford sank Andrew Scheer. He didn’t.

Now, some nameless nattering nabobs (naturally) have been hissing to reporters that Andrew Scheer would have done better if it wasn’t for Doug Ford, blah blah blah. The problem with that is twofold: one, Doug Ford did what the Scheer people asked of him – he basically disappeared from public view. He kept his head down, to avoid becoming an issue in the federal election.

Ontario’s Premier kept so quiet, in fact, he didn’t even say anything when Scheer’s folks insulted him, and invited Alberta’s Premier to campaign at three dozen events across Ontario. And Doug Ford even kept his cool when the federal Tories okayed the greatest insult of all – they encouraged Jason Kenney to campaign in Doug Ford’s own riding, without giving him a head’s up.

That’s a big no-no. In politics, there are few greater insults than that: stomping through an ally’s turf without approval. But even so: Doug Ford kept quiet, and he kept out of public view. He kept his cool. So, that’s reason number one that the Ford-sank-Scheer-in-Ontario theme is totally bogus.

Second reason? This map. Here’s how Doug Ford did in 2018.



See those swaths of blue? Those are all the places where Doug Ford’s vote was located. Places where Andrew Scheer did not win, and where Doug Ford did.

Ford’s party got less popular in their first year, true. But so did the New Democrats. Only the Ontario Liberals went up. Since the Summer, Ford’s negatives have started to shrink, significantly. His new approach to governing is paying off.

So, those are a couple reasons why the Ford-sank-Scheer claim is a myth: Ford wasn’t around, at all, when Scheer was. And Ford’s historic Ontario strength is precisely in those places where Scheer – as we’ve learned – has none.

Andrew Scheer lost Ontario for lots of reasons, which are being documented by the pundits.

Ontario alternation doomed the Scheer Tories. A PC government at Queen’s Park meant that Ontario voters couldn’t bring themselves to vote for the same team in Ottawa at the same time.

Glad to see you haven’t shut down the blog, Warren.

How to read this though?

1. Canadians seem to prefer Grits in Ottawa and Tories (or local analogue) in the provincial capitals, each serving as a check on the other. If Doug can keep Justin at bay from Queen’s Park, your typical Ford Nation member doesn’t need Andy urgently.

2. Even if Doug had campaigned more openly for Andy, it’s not clear how much better Andy would have done. There’s only so much of the Ford charisma Doug could have transferred.

3. Besides, if you weren’t from the west, the Tory platform had little to offer that the Grit platform didn’t. Doug’s star power couldn’t fix that.

4. Why did Doug take the apparent slight with such good humour, do you suppose Warren? You know him better than we do.

Forgive me for wondering if Doug has his sights on Rideau Cottage himself, and Andy is in his way!

Hi Warren,

Canadians are amazing people. All of your calls for Trudeau to lose were thwarted by the steady hand of aggregate who inhabit and define this, the greatest country in the world.

About Doug Ford:
Flawed reasoning abound!

Dough Ford was an independent variable in a multi-variate regression analysis I did on Monday night. I gained access to the consciousness of all Ontarian voters during the very act of voting using a smart phone brainwave scanning tin-foil hat. The Ford government was indeed a factor subsconsciously as they locked down their choice, there was a fair bit of BUYERS REMORSE hence your argument is weak that DOugh Ford won big blue areas while Scheer didn’t…we will never know the truth unless I sell my tin-foil hat to you and Eric @ the CBC….

Joe Biden is toast.

I think you might have been right about Scheer harming himself by talking about having a CPC majority government in the bag in the last week of the campaign. He shouldn’t have said that, even if he really believed it was a possibility. Certainly, it is questionable if his statement was based on any reliable internal polling information. Clearly 34-35% (what they actually got) is nowhere near what the CPC requires to form a majority government. Scheer also had the habit of looking and acting like a kid that got caught stealing from the cookie jar every time reporters asked him about controversial social issues or the minor scandals that arose about his personal background. It seemed he was always uncomfortable dealing with these matters and strangely unprepared to offer acceptable responses to media questions that would put the issue to rest as soon as possible. Seeing this a number of times could have easily made people uncertain and suspicious of him particularly if they didn’t know much about him to start with, which was another problem he faced. The fact that his dual citizenship became a campaign issue was an unforgivable oversight both on the part of the Canadian media which should have discovered and published that fact years ago, and also his own campaign advisers who should have insisted that he renounce his U.S. citizenship immediately after winning the CPC leadership.
Overall, Scheer and his team ran an underwhelming campaign that had too may unforced errors in it, and got underwhelming results as a consequence. I really can’t see the membership of the party giving him another chance under the circumstances, but we will see.

To save the taxpayers money I propose: 

booking one hospital room for both Scheer and Trudeau and then under surgery, quickly excise the sanctimonious gene from each of them. (And while they’re at it, make Harper’s surgery FOC.)

Then repeat the same medical procedure for each and every prospective leadership candidate of either party.

The CONs War Room was inferior from the outset. They completely blew the taxation platform plank by not incentivizing working class & middle class taxpayers with enough of a tax credit to make voting for them worth while.

The LPC had great planning emanating out of their War Room and they won the election hands down at the end of the first week.

Scheer is worthy of a second kick at the can now that he has demonstrated amply that he is capable of generating the required interest.

If the CONs had have hired the right planners they would have scored better in the long run. Ford should not be blamed for Scheer’s failings. Scheer’s War Room staff are responsible for the loss and NOT political colleagues like Doug Ford.

This was yet another election of urbanism vs. ruralism, the West being far more “rural” or at least, more in tune with rural socio-economic values. Doug Ford succeeded because he’s a Toronto-first candidate leading a party that has a solid rural foundation so was able to marry the two. Contrast that with Scheer, the aw-shucks dude from Saskatchewan which may as well be a Corner Gas caricature for most of the people living in the GTA or Montreal.

There’s an urban-rural divide that’s also reflected in every other western country. Urbanites have become immunized to the ups and downs of resource economies and couldn’t care less about agriculture, mining or energy sectors, most don’t even know anyone who owns a pick-up truck. And there’s no solution to this on the horizon, if anything the divide will become more exacerbated.

All of the attacks are Ford are from vested interests who are used to having their way. The people voted to put an end to that. Of course the Libs were going to attack Ford, and it would appear Scheer was crass and quite frankly, disloyal, and to me it is an indication of why he isn’t ready for prime time. If the CPC can’t win in Ontario, they will not form a national government. It is that simple.

I disagree with you Warren, Doug Ford DID cost the election, but not in the way many think he did. Doug cost Andrew the election because he didn’t push his way into the campaign.

I actually think the failure of the Conservatives to embrace Doug Ford and the Ontario PC was the biggest mistake of their campaign.

In Ontario who is really mad at DOFO? Would rural Ontario have left the conservatives if Doug Ford was campaigning with them? No, the unions and the left are mad at DOFO and even that does not have the protest numbers of the Mike Harris or the Dalton McGuinty days.

I’m the father of an autistic kid, if anyone could turn it would be me but I realize that the money I could never get was held up because of people milking a program for years that was intended to be a temporary training.

Doug Ford was/is the realistic needed alternative to wanton spending. He is not a right wing lunatic.

They should have been joined at the hip and bragging about how Ontario is turning around under his leadership.
Now, if you are on the left, please don’t miss the point. You are perfectly entitled to disagree about Doug Ford in any way you wish but I am saying to the view of conservative supporters he would have ADDED to the campaign.

My last point, it feeds the Liberal narrative of the “hidden agenda” when the conservative cousins can’t even be seen in public together. Harper/Hudak both misread Rob Ford’s ability to gather the vote and so has Scheer with his brother.
If you are conservative and proud of it why the hell would you hide it? If I am wrong, I would rather lose for being who I am than win and wear the mask.

What cost Andrew Scheer and the CPC’s the election? Let’s start with the CPC leadership vote in 2017.

Andrew Scheer was the first choice for only than 22%. With each successive ballot, the candidate with the lowest score was dropped. It took 13 (that’s right, 13) rounds for him to actually record 51% support. Put another way, he wasn’t even second choice for very many CPC voters for most of the rounds.

If you aren’t the first choice for the people in your own party, why do you think you will be the first choice for the entire country? Want more examples?

Joe Clark was 4th on the first ballot in 1976. Stephane Dion was 3rd or 4th on the ballot (some one can clarify that). Both went on to win their leadership campaigns after a number of ballots.

Clark did win a minority government, but that was attributed to being the result of a desire for change after more than a decade of Trudeau I. He then squandered it all by failing to understand basic arithmetic.

In contrast, Stephane Dion went down in flames against Stephen Harper.

In short, Andrew Scheer was destined to fail in the general election for the same reason that it took multiple ballots at the 2017 CPC leadership vote. He could not inspire the voters to support him.

Peter, thank you for the compliment (I think). The point I was trying to make was that when there is not a clear cut favourite (first on each ballot, with very few ballots) in the leadership campaign, then what is effectively occurring is the selection of someone who is a compromise between “warring” factions (which was the back story on Joe Clark and Stephane Dion).

If an individual fails to truly inspire the party membership, then that individual is likely to fail to inspire the general electorate. This is more an observation about human behaviour than about how a political party should go about selecting a leader.

That is why Andrew Scheer needs to be replaced during 2020. This was a winnable election, and he did not win. Increasing the number of seats, winning the popular vote – that is for the wonks who want to explain that an election loss wasn’t really an election loss. Just like hockey games, the score at the end is what really matters.

I’m wondering why J. Singh would support the Liberals without being part of a formal coalition with at least one senior cabinet position.

I suspect Singh will get a commitment to get electoral reform in exchange for his support. They do, however, have to ensure that adequate consultation is done – so we will head to a few years of hearings. Then, miraculously, the next election will hit before any changes are passed.

I didn’t quite hear – but how many time was Trudeau asked if the Liberals do opposition research?

I heard them ask Scheer quite a number of times, so I would assume that if the media were not biased they would have asked Trudeau as well.

Shying away from Ford only reinforced the narrative that the Ford government was doing something wrong. Releasing the platform on the Friday before Thanksgiving furthered the impression that conservative politicians lack the conviction to defend reduced government spending. The Conservative campaign should have messaged along the following:
“Ontario’s finances are in poor shape largely due to the people that form Trudeau’s inner circle. Telford and Butts were key figures in the Wynne government. Persistent deficits eventually accumulate large debts that diminish a government’s ability to provide services. Four years of Telford and Butts have yet to leave the Government of Canada in as bad a shape as the Government of Ontario. The Liberals propose larger deficits going forward. Given that the economy could be heading into a recession sometime over the next 4 years, Telford and Butts are likely underestimating the deficits much like they did during the years they ran Ontario’s finances into the ground. A Conservative government will take decisive but measured action to reduce deficits now to avoid harsh decisions in the future. Unfortunately, 15 years of mismanagement by an irresponsible previous Liberal provincial government has put the current Premier in a tough position. A Conservative government will not put future government services at risk. “

Greetings from Fredericton, where our Green candidate, Jenica Atwin, ran a positive and respectful campaign and is now a newly elected MP, the Green’s one gain Monday night. Not a landslide victory by any means, but a clear one. I know you’re a scrapper Warren, but sometimes voters find a candidate who focuses on the issues and doesn’t resort to attacks and mud slinging appealing. I agree with the article I’ve linked to below, we might be hearing a lot more from Jenica in the years to come.

The Green Party pulled in about 7% of the votes cast in the most recent election. How many of those votes were “none of the above” votes? In short, why are they perceived as a “national” party?

IF they want to truly graduate to the big stage, rather than just be invited to the party so that the hosts can pretend that they are inclusive, they need to do a number of things.

First, the platform has to be wider than “climate change”.

Their thin platform cannot dismiss jobs in the resource and heavy manufacturing sectors as irrelevant. The platform cannot simply state that the resource and heavy manufacturing labour force will be retrained for “green” jobs.

The electorate, for the most part, see the Greens for what Elizabeth May presents them as. A one trick pony. And very few people are looking for a one trick pony.

Her “policy” for dealing with Alberta’s oil industry was — and this is not hyperbole — positively Maoist. Shut down the industry but . . . wait for it . . . employ all those people you’ve thrown out of work in green retrofitting jobs.

How the fuck exactly was that going to work? Was every single unemployed Albertan going to be immediately offered a government retrofitting job by Lizzie May on termination of prior employment? On what terms? At the same salary and with the same benefits as the job they just got terminated from? Any cost estimate for this? Any idea how many people we’re actually talking about?

Absolute fucking madness.

Runs in tandem with the unmitigated bullshit that Alberta will never, ever, have to diversify their economy away from an almost unique focus on oil and gas.

Of course the economy will eventually have to diversify, but that’s already starting to happen. Alberta has the largest number of engineers as a percentage of its population of any province in the country. There is all kinds of innovation going on in Alberta, including the marriage of high-tech and energy production (including internet of things, smart technology etc.). I have personally been involved in projects and companies in this space.

What’s insane is some arbitrary, neo-Stalinist shutdown of an entire industry, when innovation and diversification are already occurring.

I should say, in case you get me wrong, I’m in favour of carbon taxes. That has nothing to do with nuking entire industries with a stroke of a pen — note the BC Carbon Tax, which has been in force for many years now.

I’m not arguing for a shutdown — I don’t know where you get that. As for climate science, it’s not fake but it’s not totally rocket science either — what with the alleged recent manipulation of the numbers. I seriously doubt that climate-change will be 100% on target but that doesn’t by any wild stretch of the imagination make it completely phoney.

Funny how no one is urging Ontario to shut down it’s entire automobile (carbon-emitting) manufacturing sector, it’s entire auto-parts supply sector, or Quebec’s entire aircraft (carbon-emitting) and passenger-rail (carbon-emitting) manufacturing industries. I guess a half-million Albertans have to be driven into destitude and homelessness while Central Canadians just have to pay a few extra cents per-litre for gasoline.

They are urging the Ontario automobile manufacturing sector to switch over to electric vehicles.

Passenger rail is less carbon emitting then alternatives and a lot of the cars made in Quebec are for subway systems.

Aircraft is one of the most difficult to switch away from fossil fuels. Switch to more passenger rail will help a lot, but biofuels might be best option for that industry.





Ronald O'Dowd says: 

October 24, 2019 at 6:56 pm

Chris,

Our hydro-electricity emits carbon. But will demand go down and fall off a cliff? Not likely. People keep telling me that world oil and gas heavy demand is there right into the next century. Colour me skeptical on that one. But maybe Alberta will prove us wrong. Who the hell really knows.





The Doctor says: 

October 24, 2019 at 9:01 pm

There are huge problems with passenger rail as some sort of climate change, low-carbon panacea in Canada. In a word, population density. Compared to Europe and even the US we lack population critical mass and density, which is key to being able to do passenger rail on any kind of economically sane basis.

Even in Europe, in far more densely populated countries than ours, rail is significantly subsidized.

I’m personally familiar with the studies that have been done on a rail corridor from Calgary to Edmonton, and the economics are not enticing.

I had considered voting for the “star” Green candidate(Elizabeth May’s husband) in my riding. I changed my mind when I didn’t get any response to two simple questions I asked of the candidate by email. No response, no acknowledgement, nothing. I even would have been content with a FOAD letter. I suppose it was a portent of things to come when said candidate spent election night with his spouse, rather than in his own electoral district. Perhaps he already knew that despite his “star” status, he was going down to a sad defeat. The Federal Green Party have always suffered from being a one person band, a cult of personality if you will, with no ground game to speak of, and consequently, its time to give Lizzie May the heave.

Shares in SNC-Lavalin – a company based in Quebec – went up, way up. Up 14 per cent, in a single day.

And Husky Energy – a company based in Alberta – laid off hundreds of people. I don’t know the exact number, but every news report said “hundreds.”

I didn’t find out about it from the media, anyway. I found out from my best friend, who runs an engineering firm in Calgary. He sent me an email.

The message was clear. Trudeau gets re-elected, Quebec wins. Alberta, and the West, loses.

A Quebec-based company – one Trudeau and his PMO arguably obstructed justice to help avoid a corruption prosecution – wins. And a fine Calgary company – one that plays by the rules and even embraced the idea of a carbon tax – loses.

I was born in Montreal, as was my best friend. We grew up together. We, and our families, were always reliably Liberal – even during the NEP. Pierre Trudeau’s energy plan was a huge mistake, but he at least had a philosophical context for what he did. And he had the intellectual faculties to explain himself.

His son, almost 40 years later, basically doesn’t. The son stood at a podium in Ottawa and said he needed to pay extra attention to the West, now. But he talked about the West like it was a foreign country, one he hasn’t visited yet. One he’d like to check out before his AirMiles run out.

Nobody in the West believes him anymore. As Matt Gurney wrote in the Post this morning, Justin Trudeau demonized Alberta and Saskatchewan throughout the election – their leaders, their way of life – and now he expects everyone to forget that, I guess. He surrounds himself with advisors and ministers who heap contempt on the West and Westerners.

And who then clamber into big chauffeured limousines propelled by, you know, Western oil.

I’ve lived in Toronto for more years than I thought I ever would. A couple weeks ago, I decided: I want out. I want out of here.

Westerners, starting Monday night, have started saying the same thing, in a way that they never did during the NEP.

132,Warren Kinsella,Breaking news: opposition research firm does opposition research,2019-10-26 07:40:00,Warren,,"From CBC, earlier today:

On his Kinsellacast podcast, an unapologetic Kinsella said the campaign to spotlight racists who attached themselves to the fledgling party was not supposed to extend into the period covered by election spending rules.


“Our efforts would strictly adhere to Canadian election law and cease all operations on June 29,” he said.


He also said Daisy Group’s work was “subject to full public disclosure. It would all be disclosed.”


Nor would the client be exempt from criticism, Kinsella said.


“We would reserve the right to vigorously criticize the client itself, publicly and in the media, if the client’s own members were found to be espousing racism,” he said, adding that there were times when he criticized the client in the media…


In his podcast, Kinsella defended Daisy Group’s work to undermine Bernier’s party, saying its work over the years to fight racism and white supremacy has set it aside from other companies that do similar communications and opposition research work.


“Daisy Group staff have worked for, or with, every single mainstream political party or their candidates to research, expose and oppose racist elements. Those have included the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party, the Green Party and the now-defunct Progressive Conservative and Reform parties,” he said.


Kinsella said years ago he helped Stephen Harper, prior to his time with the Conservatives, root out and expel Heritage Front members from the Reform Party.


Kinsella said he has not worked with Bernier’s party because of some of the people it has attracted.


“He has attracted the support and involvement of myriad racists, anti-Semites and bigots,” said Kinsella.


Among those who signed registration papers for the People’s Party were members of the Soldiers of Odin and other white supremacist, anti-immigration groups, Kinsella said.


Kinsella said Daisy was approached because of its reputation. “Daisy fights racism and hate. That’s what we do. That’s why we were approached to assist in exposing and opposing racist elements within the ranks of the People’s Party.”


Kinsella said Daisy Group felt it was important for Canadians to know more about the People’s Party and who it was attracting.


“We had been going after racists in other parties too, but Bernier had more than all the others put together.”


Kinsella said he has no regrets about waging the campaign against Bernier’s party.


“Will I apologize for opposing racism and homophobia and anti-Semitism and misogyny? No. Never. Will I apologize for opposing extremists and haters in Bernier’s People’s Party? No. Never.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">
			<p>From CBC, earlier today:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>On his Kinsellacast podcast, an unapologetic Kinsella said the campaign to spotlight racists who attached themselves to the fledgling party was not supposed to extend into the period covered by election spending rules.&nbsp;</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“Our efforts would strictly adhere to Canadian election law and cease all operations on June 29,” he said.&nbsp;</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>He also said Daisy Group’s work was “subject to full public disclosure. It would all be disclosed.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Nor would the client be exempt from criticism, Kinsella said.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We would reserve the right to vigorously criticize the client itself, publicly and in the media, if the client’s own members were found to be espousing racism,” he&nbsp;said, adding that there were times when he criticized the client in the media…</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>In his podcast, Kinsella defended Daisy Group’s work&nbsp;to undermine Bernier’s party, saying its work over the years to fight racism and white supremacy has set it aside from other companies that do similar communications and opposition research work.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“Daisy Group staff have worked for, or with, every single mainstream political party or their candidates to research, expose and oppose racist elements. Those have included the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party, the Green Party and the now-defunct Progressive Conservative and Reform parties,” he said.&nbsp;</em></strong></p></blockquote>

130,Warren Kinsella,“Humble”,2019-10-26 08:21:00,Warren,,"I think an important part of being humble is to actually just be humble, and not talk about it, and let people notice you are being humble. As opposed to saying you will be humble, and hoping to get credit for it before you actually do it.

But that’s just me.

From the Star:

OTTAWA—Liberals emerged successful but not unscathed in Monday’s election, prompting calls from within the party to focus on hard work, humility and co-operation in the coming minority Parliament.

As they begin the planning for a cabinet and legislative agenda for the new session of Parliament, Liberals have also been weighing the fallout of an election that saw them lose seats and take a lower share of the popular vote.

They take the result, which returned Justin Trudeau for a second term as prime minister, as an endorsement of a platform that featured the fight against climate change and affordability as priorities.

At the same time, they are also acknowledging that they fell short with many discontented voters.

“I think there was a clear ask from voters to stay focused on these issues but be more ambitious,” said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who won in Beaches-East York.

The message, he said, is to “focus on the work and be humble and to work across the aisle.

“I think there’s a strong desire for that and probably we didn’t see enough of that over four years,” Erskine-Smith told the Star in a telephone interview. “In this Parliament, I hope we see a commitment to be more ambitious, to be more co-operative and to maybe be a bit more humble.

Some Liberals are also grumbling that their campaign was too negative, focusing on the Conservatives and leader Andrew Scheer rather than on the Liberals’ economic record.

Trudeau was seen as a liability in some ridings. One Liberal MP, who asked not to be identified, the party and the prime minister need to understand that Monday’s election was a “chastisement.”","<div class=""articlecontent"">

Agreed. Seems to me though that you are either born with humility or was taught it from an early age, or you fake it. Which of course questons its sincerity .

Maybe in politics its the difference between grass roots work and astroturfing.

Aw, this is so comforting because Canadians from coast to coast went to the polls seeking a humble government. It fits the JT’s character perfectly, doesn’t it? When he gropes a woman, men everywhere have to do better. When he’s caught in blackface, all Canadians have to reflect on their white privilege. When he gives anyone who defies him or Butts the chop or gets spanked for ethics violations, Liberal backbenchers have to be more humble.

I can’t believe the Star published this crap.

But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

Not my words, but true. Justin has been humbled. I hope for his sake and the country that he has learned.

mike,

Not my words either but the proof will be in the eating of the pudding. Trudeau always talks a good game — but expect him to make the same long-term mistake Harper made. It got Harper two successive minorities and then a single majority mandate conducted under that same minority-mantra of governing as if they had a majority. That insured Harper’s ultimate loss to Trudeau and the cycle will likely repeat itself going forward if the above is the real Trudeau strategy. Like I said before: BROADHURST had better stick around.

I expect this parliament to be a ridiculous mess with nothing getting done. Oppo. will hijack committees and re-start Lavsam and who knows what else. Deficits will be bonkers. Liberal arrogance will be out of control – because if you run a campaign that badly and still win, it must be impossible to lose. A lot of Liberal MPs will be closing in on the business end of the gold plated pension so that will add to the disinterest in accountability. I predict the end of this parliament will be full of fireworks and vicious accusations, similar to the fall of 2005. Sunny ways.

124,Warren Kinsella,The ten reasons Andrew Scheer lost the election,2019-10-27 10:20:00,Warren,,"1. He’s a Western social conservative and most Canadian voters are neither Westerners nor social conservatives.

2. He allowed himself to be defined (see above) before he defined himself.

3. He was running against a celebrity, not a politician – and he forgot that people are a lot more forgiving of celebrities than politicians.

4. His platform wasn’t just uninspiring, it was duller than a laundry list.

5. He needed to balance his enthusiasm for pipelines with better ideas on climate change – but he didn’t.

6. He knew the national media favour the Liberals between elections, but he still seemed shocked when they kept favouring the Liberals during the election, too.

7. We knew he wanted Trudeau out, but we didn’t know why he wanted Trudeau’s job.

8. He had Tim Hudak syndrome – genial and easy-going in person, stiff and awkward on TV.

9. His campaign team were great on analyzing data, but not so great on mobilizing people – the Liberals actually beat them on voter ID and GOTV.

10. His inability to answer predictable questions – on abortion, equal marriage, his citizenship, etc. – screamed “hidden agenda,” even if he didn’t have one.

Too many 2015-class Liberal MPs are just 20 months or so from the richest pay-day of their entire lives (ie. their pension). Plus the NDP are flat broke, living off the mortgage on their Ottawa HQ building. There will be no election soon.
